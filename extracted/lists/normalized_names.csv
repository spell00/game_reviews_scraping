Tf2,"this game has an excellent style of fighting with high amounts of diferent weapons to use from with the help of the hl2 engine the graphics models of weapons and characters this deserves one of the best shooters game of all time as well as this mapmaking is avaliable to all people who are willing to do it same with plugins for custom servers source film maker and many more things this is overall a stunning game that i have played for a while and deserves a yes gg valvesome things that may put it down however would be the fact that some recent updates are very similar in terms of style for example the gun mettle update brought in contracts new maps etc the halloween update brought in the same thing but just different missionspeople who play other shooter games that are like cod battlefield etc one thing i would have to say to those people would be dont shout at the medic to run to you and specifically you because apparantely you are the one carrying the team with your gibus and goggles and your natascha family business and your eviction notice pub doesnt work like that sunshineas well as this dont be an heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit to the new kid or some heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit just because you got screwed over when you were new at some point this new kid will have a better inventory yes i know just because having an expensive inventory doesnt make you a better player better items and a better fighting style Tf2 doesnt need those kinds of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit on their serverseither way although there are some parts of the years to come that will be lazy there will be better things introduced frankly i want some new weapons theyve been just introducing reskins example batsaberyes"
Tf2,"well for starters when i write reviews they are usually just for the RIRE this is not the case this game is genuinely a masterpiece and i have never played a game that made me feel so many emotions that range all over the spectrum i mean hell i thought the last of us was emotional as hell one minute its happy then desparation then wanting to cry like a baby points in the game specifically made me question my manhood due to how much i was trying to not break down like a baby this game honestly does show alot of great points that are true in real life as well like value those close to you and despite this being the internet and it not being known to be shown but showing compassion and taking the time to give a helping hand could possibly save someones life it is funny that a troll on Tf2 would find such a great love and change of perspective from a game call me names call me what ever the hell you like i never thought i would go deep about a game but simply put this game while it may not be for everyone is a really great game and i honestly say it is worth more that just 20 dollars 10010"

Terraria,"at first i thought that this game would have just been another plain old Terraria type game but when i started getting the hang of it it just clicked for me i instantly loved the game with all the beautiful types of planets there are species items and so much more this game is definitly deserving an instant buy even in its early build but i know for sure that as this game progresses with newer builds and versions i know for sure that it will be well worth money spent dif you have spent your time to read this review then thank you and i truly recommend that you buy this game cause its soo addictive and exciting d"

Csgo,"its a good game to play when you have a 7 day ban on Csgo"
The_Community,"great game you can tell just by the number of people reviewing this game negatively with over 100h or 400h playedsure there are a few bugs but the devs are working hard on fixing stuff communicate with The_Community and release patches with a lot of new content every other monththis is a game based on grinding and sometime it will take time to get your gears just the way you want it but the dz is a great experience with some balancing issues that will shift the meta of the game strongly towards a build here and therehavent seen a hacker in 2 months playing the dz fairly often rank 82 people saying the game is full of hackers are the same guys that get rekt in cs and call hacks on everyone i strongly recommend this game for both the pve and the pvp aspect"
Team_Fortress_2,"this is an awesome game may overtake Team_Fortress_2 this game is an awesome shooter you play as different classes and like blacklight retribution you need to spend time farming coins to unlock characters for ever or you can wait for monthly trial rotations of the characters is great to play with friends and solo"
Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"this is a great game an fps tactical game that is more aim and team work than cod run around and spray and pray hoping to god that the server lag is in your favor overall Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive is a great map with a good community base exammple the over watch although the people you play with may be toxic or the bestfunniest people to play with warning if you play this game and you seek short periods of fun then casual and deathmatch are the way to go that and arms race dont play competitive match making if you dont have atleast 45 minutes to 1 hours worth of time for one game thats right you need a lot of time to play competitive match making let alone get good at the game that way otherwise i would recommend this game as it is enjoyable and not too over the top"

Terraria,"combines aspects from other games in a way that makes the game truly unique in its own way one of the only if any mmos that allows you to dig on the Terrarian itself although you cant build on the terrain unless its in your own cornerstone which is basically your own portable headquarters that you craft things at for an mmo this game took an interesting style of graphics that i havent seen done before in an mmo a bunch of classes to chose from all seeming quite different from one another the game is free can be a good mmo for someone whos never played one you can deassemble a weapon or accessory you dont want to turn it into crafting materials that you may find more usefulstating this many reviews on here say that the problem with the game is that it takes so long to connect to servers but this has been fixed to my understanding although there is a huge arsenal of weapons that you are preassigned based on your class eg shadow archers will only receive bows none of them actually change the way you fight or for that matter give you any feeling of variety you progress so quickly that an item you picked up that you may have considered to be really good at the time can quickly become outdated in terms of stats the game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you dont actually feel accomplished no storyline none this game is repetitive most of your objectives in this game are basically kill this and receive this or mine this and receive this due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking why am i even doing this no actual quests you have a predetermined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing you have no freedom to do what you want that is if you want to actually make progress within the game you must complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one the entire game is randomly generated making there feel like theres nothing to actually explore its just randomly generated terrain and dungeons that also seem to be very repetitive you must make an account for the game itself this isnt so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work both me and my friend had the problem character customization itself is bad not the hats theres plenty of those there arent many color options as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color eg you can not change your height width etc things in the tutorial seem to be out of order for example around my first hour of gameplay i was being being told the buttons used to attack even though i had already killed loads of enemies does not have very much music all drops are marked as uncommonrare when it comes to the rarity tag of an item ive never seen a single item marked as common i feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplishedthis game hashad a lot of potential it really did sadly i have to say that i must give this game a 410 for the reasons listed above"

Nether,"great experience best part is the player vs player interactions they really balanced out the game so that its not a mindless slaughter looking at you Nether but is still a pvp gamethe player interactions were good fun when they are not screaming friendly at the top of their lungs while running awaybut the amount of bugs is almost unforgiveablecurrently i have one where every 5 minutes i get 15 fps and can barely move buildings get low texture quality and when inside one i can not see the walls nor flooronce they fix the bugs truly a worthwhile experience"

Nuclear_Throne,"enter the gungeon is a roguelike top down shooter similar to games like the binding of isaac or Nuclear_Throne each levelfloor is randomly generated with all sorts of special rooms combat rooms secret areas and of course the boss you will need to defeat to progress to the next floor the game is perma death meaning when you die your run is over for good adding a bunch of challenge to the game gungeon has a dodge roll mechanic that is used to avoid bullets and consumable blanks that destroy all bullets on the screen these make the game a bit easierthere are many many different guns buffs and active and passive abilites allowing for heaps of potential synergies the game is also chock full of cheesy gun related puns and references to other gamestv shows etcoverall this enter the gungeon is really fun but it can be hard and frustrating at times"

Csgo,"Csgo is the most recent entry to the counter strike series if youre not famillar with this series its an online tactical first person shooter developed by the good old people at valve with hidden path entertainment helping with this entry it comes with much improved graphics compared to previous entries you must be precise and tactical with your movements the most satisfying thing about this game is mastering the huge learning curve it comes with and be warned this game is difficult compared to other shooters on the market but once you become a master at pulling off clean headshots with ease mastering each each weapon trust me youll be satisfied plus the game has workshop support various skins for each weapons new versions of classic counter strike maps dust office etc new game modes are introduced whilst classic game modes return and at a fair price you could do alot worse definite must buy"
Garrys_Mod,"i quite like rust but its definetly not perfect rust is basically dayz minecraft and Garrys_Mod combined into one game for the most part its pretty good but rust is a bit rusty at its early stages see what i did there because as most of you know rust is still in early access which means developers are still working on the game and theres quite a lot of bugs seriously there is and its the simple things like not getting into a server and not being able to craft items and other bugs and glitches that are really annoying as it stands now its a solid game but i wan na see what happens for rust in the future 20 bucks i think is a bit steep for what it is at the moment but if you wan na give this game i try i say go ahead it gets an 810 rock holding cave men"

Evolve,"banished reviewsteam release date 19 feb 2014genre city builder strategy survivaldev name and status shining rock software indieage rating naworth it yestldrbanished is a challenging but fantastic city builder which strays from the rest as it is not your typical city builder instead of huge capital cities that we see in games like cities skylines banished focuses on a small town with a low budget personally i think it is one of the best games in the city building genre that said however the ai of the villagers is rather mediocre and at the moment there isnt a whole lot to its beautiful bones this game can provide hours of good challenging fun but dont come expecting anything like cities skylines also note that this game is very hard and may be frustrating to those new to the genre even experienced city builders will also need to have a few tries to get used to its somewhat complicated mechanics and challenge banished has a bit of a lack of tutorials so dont expect that you will understand everything right awaybanished is fantastic and challenging but dont come expecting another cities skylinesafter many tries and hours of understanding every little mechanic i have finally formed a functional city with a good population yet in this game someething small or big will fail and everything will completely go down hill that is the thing with shining rock softwares 2014 city builder banished there is and always will be an underlying threat whether its famine cold a natural disaster your town will eventually go to the pigsyour town starts off with a few small hopeful families a storage barn and a stock pile with not a hell of a lot of starting resources you start off building a few small wooden houses you make some gatherers huts forester lodges nothing too big your town will slowly grow in population and size and soon you have a city on your hands however dont expect it to be a cities skylines type thing where you can just sit back and watch your city work you need to keep your eyes on the game at all times one time i had a townwide famine because the road from one of the gatherers huts to the storage barn was too long couldnt understand why everyone kept dying of starvation while it is occasionally very frustrating it is a very addictive game and sometimes when everything goes bad the game really shines the dire need of resources the feeling of hope the game will immerse you so lets get into the pros and the consprosaddictivechallenginga blast of fresh aircool art style and general feelinteresting seeing your town work and grow from the teamwork of all your villagersimmersivelots to achieve and work torelatively simplepretty good map generation settingsweather cycles which can mean life or deathlots of different ways to approach things you could use a gatherer to gather food from the forest use aquired seeds to make farms or maybe just buy all your resources off the trading post you can decidevillagers arent just lifeless robots they have needs and happiness which can be fulfilled in different waysnatural disasters are a cool feature which you need to prepare forgives you a good overview of statistics in your townconsvillager ai is mediocre at bestnot great control over a few different things like villager paths and resource managementnot a hell of a lot on its bones yetlack of tutorials just throws you in the deep endui can be a little hard to navigatesome resources like rocks are not unlimited and will eventually run out this takes a long time thoughannoying little bugs which can destroy your citywell thats basically that banished has a fair share of cons just like any game but i personally think it deserves a solid 8510it serves as a fantastic ant farm simulator as well seeing your people Evolve and grow seeing them get all wiped out fun it is one of my favourites in the city builder genre and any experienced city builder should pick up this game but even newbies to the the genre can pick up this game and have fun"
Evolve,"surprisingly its a really rather good citybuilderdisclaimer long and detailed review skip to bottom for final verdicti got tropico 4 in a humble bundle kindve only wanting the other games in the bundle so there it sat in my vast steam library not really doing anything and then my friend told me about a really good citybuilder that he had been playing i thought oh simcity right wrong he was talking about tropico tropico 5 however at this time i had forgotten that i even had it so when i looked it up on the steam store i realised that i already had it so i gave it a shot and i was quite presently surprised so here is a list explaining the good and bad elements of tropico 4 and there reasonsproseach little person has their own profilewhat was one of the elements that made tropico stand out was the ability to click on every little person walking around doing there daily routine once you clicked on them a profile of the character came up explaining their age wellbeing faction name where they work and where they live it would also make the camera follow that person sometimes i would find myself just seeing people go about their daily lives for hours on endin the population there are structured familiesa little more of a unnecessary part of the game but undoubtedly cool was the structured families sometimes when checking peoples profiles you may find a group of people with the same last name at first i thought ths was just due to the developers not putting enough names in but then i executed a guy and then everybody with the same last name as him got enraged confused i looked at the effects of executing someone and it said victims family will become enraged and thats when i realised there was families which is really coola system where technology Evolves with timemuch like civilization v which is an utterly fantastic strategy game technology would advance as time goes on this means that i might start out with some crappy tenements but when i research more stuff i could have super hightec shopping malls nuff saidthe ability of extreme powerin this game you have the power of anything and everything on the island apart from the rebels which we will get to later none of the decisions will be made for you you have to make them there are recomendations for what to build but i mostly found myself ignoring them as sometimes they can screw you overrebelsthe rebels system in this game is rather good its simple when someone becomes too unhappy with the island they will become a rebel rebels can and will screw you over they will start fires attack buildings and people and generally become out of controldisastersperhaps copying other citybuilders this game has disasters dont worry though you wont be having meteors or aliens ordinosaurs coughsimcitycough just normal things like nuclear bombs or volcano eruptions or earthquakes and it wont just be mildly annoying either it will seriously screw you over once when i built my city next to a volcano thinking it would look pretty cool lets just say it wasnt cool when flying blobs of lava engulfed the city and i went financialy in debtso thats the list of things which i think are pretty cool in this game now we will talk about the consconslimited timethe thing i can think of straight off the bat is that it has a limited amount of time for a game even in sandbox mode sure it is a while but one time i built a really great cityand then i couldnt play anymore because my mandate had run out and that was on maximum time sure it adds realism but sometimes fun should overweigh how realistic it is this is where just cause 2 shined now you might be thinking what the devil what on earth has that got ot do with tropico well my friend nothing i was just bringing it up anyways the reason just cause 2 was so fun is that it was completely unrealistic tropico should get some inspiration off thatlack of helpone of the annoying things about this game is that it just throws you in with build a city this is a large downside as the game is quite complicated in the financial part of things alot of the time i found myself looking at my amount of money going down by the thousands completely confused whygraphicsnow i would like to point out that this is a very small and minor problem especially considering its a citybuilder but the graphics are a little lackingfinal verdictso we are down to the final verdict and if you couldnt already tell with the big blue thumbs up stamped on i most certainly recomend tropico 4 even though it has flaws i can still say this is a great solid citybuilder thank you for taking some time to read this"

The_Community,"dark souls iian atmospheric adventure allowing you to have different 3 endings in totalas the dark souls franchise has always been punishing if you were to do something incredibly stupidbut despite on how much i liked the previous installments i do not like this onethe main reason is the poise system accordingly bandai namco from software have said it is working as intendedand yet the description of said feature is not how it worksin dark souls i poise was a big part of game play for casters and heavy buildsin dark souls ii poise was altered to a good degree to make some of the pvp a little more bearable for when a dex build vs strengthin dark souls ii however it is a completely useless feature that has split The_Community into 2 fragments people who think poise was an op feature for heavy builds and then the people who thinks its complete bsheavy armors main advantage was poise allowing you to withstand hits without flinching or slightly so untill youre staggered clerics sorcerers pyromancers and warriors alike were all hindered by this change to the 3rd installmentto this degree you might as well as start off deprived and play through the entire game as is or atleast use the masters attire because armor reduction does jack allim am gravely disappointed in bandai namco and from software"
The_Community,"gunslingers itself is funi enjoyed it when the matchmaking system actually gave us even geared teammates and opponents which may explain why we only won two matches but the micro transactions are too prevalent to ignore would i recommend this game to my friends currently maybe depending on whether they can deal with the micro transactions would i recommend this game if the micro transactions were removed or even balanced absolutely hopefully with this game being in early access they will respond to The_Community ' s gripes with them and remove them because this game has potential to be good real good check out the full review at httpimagengamescomgunslingersmercsforsale"

Tf2,"this game for me was a real gem admittedly i am not a big fan of puzzle games that involves a stealth mechanic but with the unique mechanic that is the crosslink system the game becomes a lot less of just waiting and moving and waiting and moving but instead becomes more like setting up a complex mouse trap that incapacitates every guard in the building with the flick of a switch and thats where the fun comes from not the hiding and the stakes of being found but trying to find the quickest and easiest way to the objective through utilisation of the environment the story is clever well written but short the level design is topnotch and with the implementation of a steam workshop supported level editor i can see a much longer playtime through the various community levelsoh and you get a Tf2 hatso even if you dont like stealth games theres a demo that you can test the water with and you never know it might just be that one good game you never see coming"
Dont_Starve,"an excellent city builder no tech tree no fancy jigamawots to help youwhat this game has and what you can do in this game the game has seasons eg winter spring summer make a town your town will have houses crop fields woodcutter blacksmiths and many more structures have to take care of your slavillagers villagers will start of as labourers you can give villagers individual jobs children eat your food and they do fck all they soon grow up to adults adults will eventually die from old age the game has a good tutorial you have to survive the winter if you dont have enough fire wood your villagers will freeze and diethis game is very detailed i have survived 8 years so far im still going wooh ingame years duhsome tips i find helpfull roads make your villagers walk faster crops are very good for food but it needs to grow if some of your structures are to far away from eachother put your stockpiles in between so your villagers dont have to walk as far to get to the stockpiles educated villagers are more efficient at their jobs make sure you stock up on firewood for the winter place the forester near many treeshope these tips helpif you get this game the only thing i can say is good luck and Dont_Starve and freeze to death"

Tf2,"not really much fun its Tf2 once you get to a certain point and its not even balanced the freetoplay users can not trade while the premium users can and thus youre crippled if you arent paying themup until level 20 a few hours youre stuck in a grind against ais then you can opt to do some small number of missions with random players against ai once more but its largely about the pvp play at that pointsadly the pvp isnt much fun because the leveled and paying players are better equiped by a fairly good marginskip it"
Tf2,"2200 hours of pure heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kickin fun this is a must have for all people who have a steam account people say Tf2 is a cod copy and when they do i check tab to see how many times this ahole had been dominated if youre just starting off i highly reccomend soldier he is a great starting off character he has decent health and damage and racist remarks thatll keep you laughing for days if you want to be the favourite on your team switch to medic and heal some folks or equip blutsauger medigun and bonesaw and just go full on battle medic a great gamode to start off in is control point it shows you how to get around efficently with great big maps but whatever you do avoid being seen wearing the gibus at all times unless painted this has to be the very best f2p game there is 1010"

Garrys_Mod,"just another example of a good game that will never die i bought this game so i could have extra textures for Garrys_Mod and decided to play it one day after 2 hours i was outstanded by the game it is easy to join severs some with fast dl and amazing community made maps it is easy to talk to other players and send messages and everybody gets a good frame rate i recommend this game more the global offensive as it is simply better the only downside is the graphics that are not to bad for a game made so long agofinal score 910"
Csgo,"a must have for any Csgo players or anyone having lag with mmos it takes the delay time away and lowers ping yes there are some lag spikes but to be fair it is still in beta"

Csgo,"okay this is the real review of minei started playing Csgo somewhere in 2014 it was fun at the start also competitive with stupid silvers no offense to those silvers who are new im also silver 1 but with big heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit stats let me talk about competitive5v5 is intense i love it yet people in silvers dont know how to cooperatewhy im still silver 1 for 2 months oh cmon i keep playing this game all day"
The_Community,"i had a long hard think about it and yes it is a lot of money for what is essentially a few new guns it was a lot of money for 2 new helicopters but what i failed to understand then was that bohemia do things differently theyre not your activision or ea that spam out the same unoriginal dlc time and time again just as a simple cash grab bohemia listen to their community granted youre being constructive with your critisizm and they arent scabbing money off you for cheap remember karts all funds raised from that went to charityhelicopters and marksmen are priced as they are because you support the developers and development of the game weve been given a bulk of the dlc for free infact weve been given everything for free in the recent downloadable content all bar the ability to pilot the two new helicopters and a new showcase for slingloading im not a professional when it comes to game development but i understand the constraints a small team like bohemia have and i pledge my support to them because theyve made a series that not even your most popular shooters today come close to rivlingsomething that will come in the future is bigger dlc much like baf pmc and acr were to arma 2 there just needs to be a better understanding within The_Community of bohemias goals and aims with this game ive seen many people hang so much heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit on this game yet theyre not able to see the greater picture"
Men_Of_War,"for people who love the Men_Of_War series you should definately give call to arms a tryalthough its early access and there is no vehicles in multiplayer yet i definately recommend this game if you ever wanted a modern age in men of warthough i would like to request that the helicopters should be able to hover like in Men_Of_War vietnam and maybe you should add an animation where troops zipline from the helicopter instead of landing in the middle of a battlefield and pretty much get shot down instantly apart from my request i guess the game is 910 just add more vehicles and maybe more factions but i dont know about that thoughit would be cool if there were morefactionsmaps vehicles new animationsmore units and maybe battleships maybe"

Csgo,"i give the game 910it is a good game im not sure about the skins though it makes it look like Csgo like game now since they added safes to crack its pretty much the Csgo unboxing boxes getting stuff the micro trancastions skins and the safes are kind of a bad idea i dont like itbut overall i think it is a great game"
Portal,"this was a really edgy mod it adds to the lore of Portal and gives its own spicy story though i did noclip like half of the game because was extremely hard in my opinion i wouldnt call that a complaint though as it was made to be hard besides that i still enjoyed the majority of the game the voice acting in this is impressive tooif you enjoyed Portal 2 then you should definitely get this as it is free"

Dota_2,"2013 Dota_2 good players good game less blaming games end usually quick about 40mins tops2014 Dota_2 still good players but is becoming less still less blaming game time incresed 1hour long2015 Dota_2 has become very viral and infected with more blaming many players that gives up easy2015 Dota_2 reborn good somehow this improved the whole dota custom games are boss but in normal match idk yet overall 1st timers playing dota learn 2 play before going 2 real matches to avoid much blames and flaming even report for casual players just coz ur team sucks just get on with it and play dont b a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit and feed the gamehardcore players no commenttroll players i sometimes like and dislike depends on situation"
Team_Fortress_2,"while i dont play it anymore Team_Fortress_2 is an amazing game its fun and has a surprising amount of backstory with the comics and meet the videos every class feels different and is well balanced cant say the same for some items though and the modding community makes the game even greater by adding new content such as skins new gamemodes and new models Team_Fortress_2 is a game that everyone should try out and play with friends45"

Garrys_Mod,"hey guys just reviewing Garrys_Mod so first of all Garrys_Mod is a game to fit allmost people it has lots of good gamemodes and singleplayer is just the same so if i gave it a rating out of 10 id give it 910"
Dont_Starve,"this game is addictive i highly recommended Dont_Starve for anyone who likes challenging and hardcore style its really fun and the development has announced that they will add multiplayer in this game which is cool buy it now otherwises it gon na increase prices"
Metro_2033,"metro last light has the revamped but faithful aesthetic that all sequels do and a hint of the brooding quality of 2033 but sadly last light has the texture of nothing more than an expansion for the original masterwork last lights main attraction the campaign holds an uneven tale that varies from cliched to thrilling but it chiefly favours the middle ground of these two the first half to 3 quarters of the story lacks the startling originality and intense desolate air 2033 portrayed to remarkable effects but with the gritty and grimy ambiance used as a crutch last light stays above water and carries the player through with few articulate qualms save the dated ai and unabashed exposition present in almost every encounter it is when we reach the final act in last light that things begin to crack and crumble a rushed conclusion pooled with little climax creates a palpable sense of disheartenment as if our long winding journey towards this heavily anticipated finale was a waste of time alas this disappointment is what i ultimately walked away from last light with a spasmodically engrossing but stilted phase in the metro series gunplay and environments are barely worth mentioning as they follow the same archetypal structure of their predecessor but with slightly improved graphics caked over the top the main resonating feature in last light is sadly displeasure but then again it would be a miracle for this game to even come close to the staggering uniqueness and darkness that Metro_2033 was best known for6510im only recommending this because a thumbs down is a bit too harsh"
Tf2,"Tf2 great game worth buying the orange box but its free to play thanks to the great gaben i think its worth the download ps no team needs 5 spys please go medicpss theres alot of bronys and there often mvp"
Csgo,"i use to think that Csgo is the best game on the planet until they released this revolver which is ruining the game deagle used to be skill based and now this revolver is not really skill based gun i hope that valve nerf this gun to make it fair for everyone"
Tf2,"the only thing i dont like about this game is that i cant get shovel knights hat in Tf2"
Dont_Starve,"a fantastic game that is now double the fun Dont_Starve together is rewarding as you can slay monsters togther create tactics for hunting and have 2x more depending on the players the productivity but in a hilarious and fun way in can be more punishing food is more scarce there are more monsters and when a mate gets killed his ghost will haunt you and drive you to suicideif you love Dont_Starve and have a friend or two who also enjoys the game buy this and you will have hours and hours of fun if your a tight heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit like me just wait untill it becomes free"
The_Community,"this game is a great game let me rephrase that this game was a great game wonder why ill tell you whyfirst off being honest i used to absoluteley love playing this game even before it was on steam the matches were fun balanced friendly and all out great even though the robot building was a bit tough i liked it as it gave me challenge to buid something cool but allow me to learn from what works and what doesnt but then it was introduced to steamfirst up what i though when i saw it first arrive on steam i was like oh awesome its on steam now now i can play with my friends it was good for quite a while but then they started updating alot more at first it was pretty good with the addition of armoured blocks and electroplates amongst other things but then the later updates happened they are what annoyed mefrom what i saw with those later updates were new blocks and some new game mechanics and matchmaking some were alright but others were absoluteley horrible ideas to even get to the development without asking The_Community what they wanted as if its freejams way of saying we dont give a damn about what The_Community wants added we just want more money and this kind of behavior really annoyed me as for one thing they changed they removed the armoured blocks for what heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing colours that you need premium for more than 4 types or was it the fact they wanted to attempt to balance the entire battle challenge of the game they also removed the pilot seat like thats what defined the shape of your robot and how you designed it as they likely wouldve though it being to easy to be killed they removed itnot only did they add new mechanics that heavily unbalanced the battles by having a 10sec nohit repair time delay that allows anyone to fully repair their bot if they stay untouched for 10 seconds but they changed the entire techtree so many heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing times it cant even be called a tech tree anymore its more of a damn techspiral now while it used to be you had to earn points to select what you wanted to unlock instead of leveling up to get each item consecutively like theyve done now and the fact that theyve set it with each conescutive item tier the price is drastically increased so most people will get premium to spend real money for ir i understand that they need money to keep it being developed but honestly 500 ingame credit price increase for one tier higher in which most people cant be bothered mustering enough ingame credits to buy alot of those as thats what most people doworst part is with the addition of the robot factory which is just a market where people can sell people thier robots so new players that get what they want will just purchase a high tier bot and use that which makes the games already unbalanced rank matching even worseto end this review rant if i made a review of this game before it was on steam and i would say that you should get and you should play it but im not instead im saying that you should not play it if you are unable to spend real money for this game as it basically a money making machine for the company and heres a message for the devs and freejam chnage what you have done to this game listen to The_Community dont just look at a few people saying that they dont like something or they would rather something listen to the people that actually care that actually want this game to be fun and something that they can play and actually enjoy playing itinstead of being annoyed by the tryhards with bought robots"
The_Community,"this is a good game and heres whyfirst off this game is not just a game with a few levels it has many and with the involvment of The_Community the amount of levels is almost limitless so you have many levels to challenge yourslef with and you can make your own levels so others may challenge themselves on your levelsnext is the fact that it uses music to create amazing game immersion with the levels being created so well that they are in time with the song used for that level so if you create your own level make it to a song so it fits perfectlynot too much to say about this game as it has such a small amout of amazing features but there is the fact that there are enough challenging acievements to keep you playing it for weeks on end unless you dont even care about achievements the levels should keep you going anywaythere is one thing that i would like to ask of the developers can you please add more sources for songs so people can use songs that cant be on newgrounds so that way people arent limited by the newgrounds audio pages"

The_Community,"miscreated is a multiplayer open world survival game in which you fight against the elements environment and living beings after a devastating war you will start in the world with a tshirt jeans and a flash light in which your goal will be to gear up by scavenging nearby houses car parks schools and other potential looting grounds for cars weaponry crafting components and tools combined with trying to avoid or possibly kill the existing mutants or survivorssomething to note considering every other survival game has this issue is The_Community isnt entirely a kill on sight type of mentality which is good youll get people chatting with you trading or even possibly grouping up to defend against bandits or you may even decide to build your own base and hoard all the loot in the universethe developers also seem very passionate about their game and are listening to feedback and followed by that is great ideas for future updates which will definitely make this game even better personally i would like to see more mutants so id be swarmed with no hope of surviving possibly increasing the limitations on how many objects you can have in your base followed by storage containers so you can hold all your items instead of throwing some away also i would like to see the temperature system back because ive heard people talk about it and it sounds very interestingi highly recommend this game for i have enjoyed my time so far i shall continue playing this whilst also keeping an eye out for the magnificent updates which take place join us now we need more people to jump on and get involved in the carnage"
The_Community,"an outstanding game thats so polished in its current state that it almost seems complete id pay the price of a triple a game even if theres only infantry warfare currently even with that in mind theres so many variations of outcomes fortification opportunity and tactical plays that will never make any scenario seem the same whats even better is almost if not all the player base follow orders word to word which makes the game vastly superior to any military game out there in the current mix on top of that The_Community is mature and friendly and is always willing to helpsummary this is truely the best community ive had the pleasure of playing with and will continue playing with to the ends of time 1010"
Csgo,"this game is like Csgo but u do minigames and unlock different weapons its a bit like dirty bomb except its more like a first person shooter but roughly more great to enjoy if you are playing dirty bomb you should go and get this game"

The_Community,"tldr mechanics and lategame equipment are good and welldone earlygame is incredibly difficult and The_Community is quite literally aidsbeginning in rust is very difficult by yourself even playing with friends is difficult you spawn with a rock and a torch and you have to get wood and stone to create tools like hatchets and pickaxes then you need cloth to make a sleeping bag for a spawn point or to get your friends into the same area as you and hope to find that one person whos willing to lend a hand in rust morals dont exist everyone will try to kill you for the stupidest of reasons mining an ore node someone was nowhere near guess what you died that guy wants that ore node for himself and hes not gon na let you and your naked body take itbut lets assume you got past all that you built a base and have your materials in chests all neat and tidy you have an airlock for your house which is locked with armoured doors which makes it all the more difficult for raiders to get in you find other people who are willing to help you progress with your little game and everything seems pretty nice everyone is still out for your blood even the people you trusted you may or may not come back to find yourself dead because disconnected players dont disappear oh no your character goes to sleep leaving you out in the open for someone to just walk by somehow get into your house and then take everything you own death is inevitable like in all games but it happens way too often here the wolves and bears dont kill you people do people who have no liking for anyone else and dont care how recently they spawned people who are going to claim to be friendly then blast your face full of bullets people who just want to annoy the everliving crap out of you just because they canif youre into The_Community more than the game mechanics doubtful then this is something to steer well clear of if youre into mechanics and willing to lose your soulmorals to the game go right ahead its not my 20 anyway"

Nether,"im really sorry to say because this game looked awsome so much that i purchased it but i feel it is missing the mark they say you can access most of the sky scrapers but thats barely true and even the ones you can have a sad mdkgta3 feel 2 them i really dont know why it recomends a quad core 24gz cpu because the graphics resemble something from the early 200s and either their rendering system is doing the crysis thing of rendering things that you cant even see or something else is amiss but the few servers i did try were dull and uneventfull im not doing the narrow view thing and comparing to dayz because frankly i think state of decay is a better zombie survival game but i just found Nether underwelming dont get me wrong i liked some of the texture details and the mechanism as far as encorouging coopperative play rather than just killing every1 2 steal their things thats something that sux about most pvppve games rust as an example great game and well thought out but most people will kill you rather than work with you to survive but i liked the idea in this that you have clear reasons why you should work together and the safe zones are cool alot to do in there i guess what im trying to say is im underwhelmed at the moment and will have to just check back at a later point when things have been updated a bit more look forward to future updates"
Starbound,"right at the moment of writing this review i have bf4 gta5 and crysis3 waiting for me to play yet i am playing this game i know this is unfinished but the potential of what this game could become is epic imagine dayz minus the extreme clunkiness and a shooter capability and ease of use like cod or cs voice chat base building and bandits includedif you are not against early access or even if you are this is one of three games worth spending money on the others being dayz and Starboundupdate recent patch has ruined gameplay as the night cycle has gotten longer due to a new lighting engine but this does not effect players with the gamma cheat on their physical monitors battles overnight has completely turned pro gamma cheaters getting killed at night is now a much higher possibility"
Csgo,"im a veteran cs gamer since classic cs 14 i hated many gameplay decisions since 16 including the dreaded steam requirement2003 tactical shield16 not being able to remove the silencer instantly with weapon swapping and recently the one i regard the worst decision ever the removal of the mp5 and spray tagcs go players are now left with tbagging corpsesthe current players are riddled with hackers here and there and mostly play on the competitive matches these players have hacks which include wall hacks aimbots noflashsmoke etchackers never get vote kicked because they are mostly carrying their team while typical nonhacking kids get instant vote kicks as soon as they push their mic buttoncounterstrike is around 15 years old as of this review and valve have not locked down the hacking problem compared to many many other shooters there are only 2 hackless places that exist tournaments and internet cafes that actively sue walkin hackerson the other hand cs gameplay have not changed and remain smooth and swift spotting have grown more difficult as player textures blend better within terrain textures since cs source the inclusion of party search let you find games with friends but the classic auto balance fail on normal matches as parties of 3 or more get split over the two teams the workshop is a great addition for instant map download and gaming but steam accessibility and quality have always been sub par its like comparing facebook and google plus one is obviously designed by penguins but everyone is on it while the other has class and quality but nobody uses it all in all Csgo is worth the nostalgic visit but if you plan to stay buy it on a new steam account on a computer that you will never use your main account on download those hacks and join the competitive matches i would not recommend this game due to one single persistent con the enormous amount of direct effect hacking activityoh and if valve say that they have banned many hackers its because they have but also because they want you to feel that its now safe to play"
Csgo,"i dont understand all the hate about this gameapp read the description first leave it open its designed to run in the periphery of your life only interact with it when you feel like it you can play mountain while playing other games if you are not playing it it will play itself based on this youre not meant to play it youre supposed to chill and listen to the soothing sound tracks i seriously recommend getting this why the sounds are brilliant i dont spend time watching everything that has changed in the game no i leave it open while i read or study or when im showering i sometimes leave it open when i sleep those haters are hardcore players while poeple like me and some few others enjoy the sounds of nature in a nutshell if you game to be a professional gamer in any sense dota2 Csgo etc you might regret getting this game but this would be the least regretul game you have bought but if youre the person who games casually and do other things as a hobby not just gaming you have to consider getting this peace d"
Team_Fortress_2,"who would have guessed that this game would have been a freetoplay f2p game it is amazing knowing an amazing game like this is freethere is a reason why this game is called Team_Fortress_2 this game really need coorporation between players and a lot of teamwork i can tell those who have never played a game like this without teamwork your team is doomed there are different classescharacter various of maps and modes cant really get bored unless your team is not cooperating at all by the way there is a tutorial in the game which really helpsfor those newbies i would personally pick the soldier as your firsttry class he uses a rocket launcher the first time i use this guy i was all like eat rocket while shooting randomly anyway he does a lot of damage plus your health is one of the highest in the game you can also shoot at your feel right after you jump to rocket jump this will give you advantage to quickly get into the front lnes to get to a higher spot or just to run away from trouble but be warned this trick damages you too use it wiselytotally recommend this game for those who have a gang of friends starting the game with friends is way better than starting alone with aboveaverage strangers"

Evolve,"this is an honest review of ark survival Evolvedi have played 150 hours in 4 weeksfor those who have not played ark it is the best survival game ive ever played alot of people say this game is bad because you loose all your stuff over night but this is only on pvp servers you can also play on pve servers where your stuff can not be stolen the amount of content in this game is amazing if you have not bought the game already i highly recommend it if you are worried about loosing your stuff play on a pve server and you will not regret it i recommend community pve servers like mmoblitzs server if you are interested in pvp then you will have the risk of loosing all your stuff when you are not online but this can be stopped by having an active player at all timesi highly recommend ark to anyone who is interested in ityou wont be disapointed"

Evolve,"lets get all of this clear i played over twenty hours in the beta and it refused me to play any more apparently my beta time ran out however throughout every hour of this game i was finding new ways to play new tricks to try and new methods to win the round i had only played two different classes trapper and monster only two i cant imagine what else i could have learnt about the game if only i had played more i played twenty hours and was still stuck on how daisy worked when i first saw gameplay and trailers i was insistent on how unreplayable it seemed i stuck around though i entered for the beta and as i mentioned earlier i was hooked wow that looked pretty epic and i wonder if they would fall for was coming out of my mouth at least once each round they say in the evacuation tutorial tutorial for the evacuation gamemode that there are and i quote over 800 possible combinations for the ultimate in replayability thats the socalled campaign of Evolve there are something like five gamemodes at the moment if you werent blind enough to read the text if you chose the evacuation gamemode then you would know this not to mention the amount of tutorials they had already released in the tutorials section which displayed information about all the gamemodes that were going to be available on release so for all you whiners out there about how boring it is and how you got bored after two hours and how that must have had an oh so terrible impact on your life keep reading it gets even betteri also read in a lot of the thumbs down reviews that the game is multiplayer only for your information i have just tested the singleplayer completely offline disconnected from the wifi offline and i almost got my teeth kicked in by a bunch of normal difficulty bots i tried both teams you can play not only evacuation mode but also any other gamemode that you wish ready offline and still have a hell of a challenge to it if you had only stopped to understand that when you get access to the open beta for a game such as this a game designed to play online with other people that the developers must evaluate how the game operates under stress of course there are going to be a hell of a lot of bugs of course there are going to be faulty optimizations this is what a beta is for so that you may tell them that there are bugs and so that they may fix them i found over thirteen little glitches in the beta one included a little bug where if you tried to climb a wall and the dome fell right in front of you as you went midanimation to climb you would simply slide down the wall and get stuck halfway inside the dome when it was released yesterday i immediately went to try it out and well fixed same place probably not the exact same time in the animation but it was definitely within the time frame needed to get me stuck stop complaining about bugs if all you did was play the beta in hopes for it to be perfectokay one thing i must sit on the fence about is the dlc costs i agree that it costs too much but i disagree that its enough to make you not buy the game firstly because the dlc does not add any bonuses other than aesthetics and different characters ok cool different characters great mhm you dont need them at all whatsoever nobody said to you that in order to play this game you have to buy all the dlc or in order to enjoy the game you have to buy all the dlc not a single person but those who didnt bother reading what the dlc actually is the tier system in the game does not i say again does not give you access to new monsters and characters because theyre stronger it gives you access to them to keep you playing the game to find new play styles and combinations and weaknesses and strengths and opportunities where one persons ability might come useful where yours currently isnt that doesnt mean that you will completely forget the first character you used in a certain class no instead i went back to the original character because her toolkit suited my playstylesorry for the fairly long post everybody but i just hope that this clears any doubts that you may have had about the game be it with singleplayer issues or bugs or dlc if you have anymore questions then feel free to contact me through this account or send me an email at RIRE for reading and go slay some monsters"
Terraria,"this game i would recommend but that recommendation is slimdeepworld is more of just some timewaster hobby than it is a game most quests i have done are too restrictive or i deem are impossible due to the current state the world doesnt have a unique pattern of scenery griefing seems to be the top contendor of that issue and the game still has current bugs and glitches that are yet to be patched even though they are simple to encounter and the idea that the entire game revolves around online play is despicable maybe add some sort of singleplayer mode or custom since the game kind of revolves on Terraria take tips off thembut there are some reason that i have that make me feel this game could be one of the best the skill bar is a fantastic idea more unlockables and it makes the game more challenging and addictive different weather and environmental hazards such as acid rain keep you on your toeswhile i said this game was more of a hobby i didnt mean a bad one"

Undertale,"slightly spoileryas silly as it sounds my experience playing Undertale was just that an experience gameplaywise its incredibly simple walk talk battle enemies but its how it utilizes those simple elements and creates a powerful story centered around it as you walk from point a to point b you can feel that you have made a journey youre exploring this foreign perilous world you grow attached to the interesting and quirky characters you meet and the way you face against your enemies is actively shaping the outcome of your adventure this is a game were like in real life everything has powerful consequences that you cant just run away from even if you try the age old habit of save scumming something that Undertale loves to pull apart and analyzea lot can be taken from Undertale and very rarely does a game succeed in so many ways on leaving a mark on its player many of the games concepts the deconstruction of the rpg the psychology of ingame characters and the godlike powers of a player to manipulate the games world can of course be preached by lesser artists but tobyfox has combined visuals gameplay story music and character and shaped them all into such a unique game that has proven it deserves all the recognition it getswhile i may not have the heart to play the game again i absolutely want to see other players experience it for the first time like i did please pick up this game if you have the chance its worth it"

Terraria,"let me tell of a recent adventure i had while playing this with my friendwe started on a large island wasnt as large as i thought it would be but it was large enough of course we started gathering woods first so we could have a shelter for the first night whereas my friend focused more on the framework i focused more on making our shelter look pretty by adding a japanesethemed roof once we placed the last chair the guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his our first night wasnt bad we just stayed inside made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range so for the whole night we shot zombies with our bows and arrowsthe rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that we collected woods and sometimes stones improved on our shelter which eventually turned into a tower and eventually mined we kept mining a specific network which in time lead us to the underworld now mind you we played on hardcore so if i died then i die for good on that server anywho our first trip to the underworld wasnt too bad we made a hellevator and rode it down to the underworld we scouted for a bit until we were attacked by demons when we lost more that 50 of our health we knew it was time to go back and so we teleported back home with our magic mirrorsso from that day forward our mission was to mine the hell out of hell now this is where the story ends i thought for sure that i would have died from a demon or fell and slipped into lava but no it was from something else entirely i decided to discover more of the network of caves and hope to find treasure chests here and there but no i stepped on a pressure plate and a boulder fell on me i died while my friend laughed and stole my items that was when i stopped playing Terraria then update 13 came and i was like yipee i wonder what other deadl y contraptions redigit has in store for mepls excuse bad inggris"

Well_There,"poor oversight by magic 2015 developers in the gamepositives include a catchy theme song ability to construct a deck to however you like storyline is not a bad inclusion opening more boosters to provide anticipation and excitementsadly however the negatives definately out weigh the positivesyou are restricted in deck building to a limited selection of cards after you have completed the campaign unless you which ti invest in boosters to increase your card pool matching up against others who have superior cards oreven duplicates or sets of 4 cards whom have purchased additional boosters not only makes deck building difficult ineffective but also increases the likelihood that you will be demorilised over and over again in matches against other opponents in 1 v 1 or free for all matchingi generally enjoy purchasing this product for the puzzle games last turn puzzles a few years ago were amazing and difficultchallanging 2014 however showcases some very sub par puzzles games and this year Well_There are nonei played one game of free for all on 4 v 4 and i felt so far away from the game table i requested my flatmate to provide me a magnifine glass myself and another player also realised 4 turns in that we had already lost when one of the players threw down some superior cards for which we had not even access tothis put me off continuing playing this game into the future as really there is no point unless i am wishing to invest into thissuggestions would be to at least bring two headed giant match making back a level par card selection by perhaps charging a set 15 fee from the start and not this micro transaction booster option which is poor oversight in my opinion and perhaps even a tournament mode where equal par magic the gatherers could paticipate tournaments of 10 players etc round robin to then provide a level based system and a decent points rating for those wishing to climb to the top in rankings over time by winning more tourneys etcrating interface music score story concept 610 as what else can you do with a story reallygameplay campaign 510 as well the ai seems to get the perfect run of cards sometimes sdeck building feature 810 as this is very flexiblecard selection 210 extremely limited unless additional investments madegameplay vs human 310 for the reason you will become frustate that you are unable to build a deck that is consistent without investment into more booster packsoverall i would probably rate magic 2015 410"

The_Community,"so i came into this game full of hope and high expectations the game delivered on all of themhowever The_Community did not if you enjoy brigading biased moderators and a generally smug passiveaggressive pve crowd that will go out of their way to shutdown any remotly pvp inclined interaction then this is the game for you there is no player versus player piracy bounty hunting or combat in general short of highly organized and rather drab league play nothing dynamic and engagingbasically this is a space trucking and tourism sim"
Terraria,"i love sending zombies sprawling from my laser minigun which i got from a martian saucer which can only be fought after defeating the golem who is the boss right after plantera who is a giant angry rose that will give you a staff to summon tikimen these tikimen are really good for taking out the mechanical bosses who are the bosses that spawn after the wall of flesh has been defeated the only to summon the wall of flesh is by killing a voodoo demon and dropping the guide voodoo doll into the lava of the underworld which is the deepest point of Terraria before going to the underworld you should take out all the prehard mode bosses"

Evolve,"this game is very fun im a huge fan of the total war series and this is a great title and probably better than rome 2 or some of the other newer titles great combat awesome seiges and you have to use a good degree of strategy to beat your opponenet but what really make this game for me is the mods the mods are the best making total overhauls or just small adjustments its what makes this game long lasting for me my favourite would be age of petty kings a game of thrones mod great fun as i conquer my enemies and crush their skulls the generals also have alot of character as they Evolve over your playthrough the spearmen are op and you can basically destroy anything with them with minimal loses in my playthrough also on my desktop which has windows eight the game crashes every time i open it be carefull about thatrecomend you get this fantastic game and replay value over 100"

Portal,"the ball is a fps puzzler game from teol studios and tripwire interactivethe publishers of killing floor and red orchestra this is takes about 8 hours to beat like the desciption says this game is like Portal meets gears of war and why because for Portal the ball object is like the companion cube where you place that spot and place another and that and gears of wars the underground level designs and the creature aliagator things are similer to the locust soldiers and the graphics is powered by unreal engine which looks good the story was ok and the combat mechanics didnt impress me that much when you beat the game theres also a surivial mode which you must surivie which waves of enemies i give this game a 68 out of 10"

Undertale,"this is another game similar to the likes of the stanly parable it is not so much of a game and more of an experience an experience which if you do not do a huge ammount of dawdling and exploration cant last more than 2 hoursthe gameplay consists of walking through hallways listening to a narrator discuss what you are seeing the only gameplay clearly visible is the use of a simple puzzle as a mean of storytelling if anyone had trouble with that puzzle i am curious to know how you continue to function however the content taht is within the game is difficult to review its a bit like Undertale and other heavy story based games where if i mention something within the game it will ruin the experience overall though i would not say that this was an allright experience but it feels kind of like something i would have found on the likes of gamejolt for freebies rather than a 10 game even so it is still worth playing in my opinion and at the time of writing it is the holiday sale which reduces the price down to 6 which can be a more justifiable pricetag in my opinion just know that1 it is not a game2 it is entirely possible on the first playthrough to beat the game in about an hour and a half 3 the ideas explored can be done better and have a very specific person in mind which would give a great emotional response if you happen to be one of those people social anxiety otherwise it may not be a worthwhile experience4 for someone to get the most enjoyment you must be soemone who does creative work not specifically games you could be an animator artist designer ect and still get the same expereience as a game dev overall i would say for the price of 6 i paid for it i would give it a 6510 however i beleive that it should still be played for the experience that it offers"
Tf2,"first things first this will not replace your desktop no matter how much you tryit is just too inneficent to replace a wall with icons to double click and open up nearly anything with a 3d enviroment that will take time walking inbetween shortcuts the only scenario where i think aa will be faster is in the case of a webcomic where instead of going to a website click on the icon wait a second and it opens up on your 3d desktopyou are playing this game because you want points for style and my is there much style to be had here even with the basic game one example i can give is if you find a good enough map you can make rooms for different items remember this game can be mounted onto other source games meaning you can use those maps a good thing to do would be to go into the gmod workshop and find a good map mount gmod onto aa and build a map from that whilst you are on the workshop look also for ragdolls models and other objects you would want to put onto your map my map has tanks from warhammer 40k legendary pokemon an artificial forest all on a star destroyer all with all my games creative software movies music ect neatly catergorised and placed onto the map from which i can see all visually rather than having to explore a music library or look down a list of my steam games of which i have hoarded over 100 now i even have a room dedicated to comics that i had bought on comixology and i can read them straight from that roomanarchy arcade like many have said can be considered a mancave simulator i have to agree to an extent consider the possibilites of what you can do to this mancave do you want a simple appartment with quick and easy access to your items or do you want to go all out put your cave on the moon on one of those Tf2 trade servers i am working on rebuilding my cave in minecraftrealmsv2 at time of writing and will probably post to the workshop when i am finished working on it on a star destroyer or even if you really wanted to create your own map and share it to the workshop the source engine allows for that and its a matter of your skills as to whether or not you want to do that do you want your mancave to be simple videos posters music or do you want guards tanks a sphinx or my personal favourite a scarab from the halo franchice tldr this is for those who do not care for efficency and can only be considered more useful when you have too much stuff on your desktop where it becomes near impossible to read otherwise you can create the coolest desktopmancave the source engine allows for that"

Csgo,"its Csgo but way more difficult and tactical and instead of being round based its more objective based where you complete the objectives on a map blowing caches up capturing points and when you get to the end thats a roundmaps are pretty good theres a good variety of long distance and close quarters combateight different classes with different roles modular gear system chose your weapons attachments armour plate carrier etcits good i personally prefer coop mode basically vs waves of bots with unlimited capacity"

Nether,"well as i ' m sure most of you have read do not buy this game if you do not like pvp or you are not very patientas for the game itself it is rather basic atm loot spawns in predefined areas the map is rather small smaller then dayz easily there is a lot of grinding to get later tier items or to build large bases unless you raid a lot most of the guns can be hard to handle that is why i prefer the pistols and bolt action my advice to new players is to find a server that has a low pop the closer to zero the better then you can learn about the other parts of the game also a well hidden base is better than a bigger base any day everyone can break down even the mightiest fort given enough time spent 12 hours once breaking down a castle with grenades also google an online map and get used to it also take note of loot spawns and areas that have a high resource densitywooden buildings decay much faster than metal and are easier to break into when you want to build you have to craft foundations onto which you place pillars 4 in each corner depending on design you can then place a ceiling on it on which you can place more pillars since it also acts as a floor place walls windows doorways inbetween or place a stairwell in it it takes a lot of resources to build big buildings as well and then you have to maintain them on top of thatanimals also tend to spawn near loot areas but you can find some scattered around the map they are a great source of food and i have never had to go hungry past my first 3 days so actual survival is not that important if you do all right at the start once you get to high levels you will start to get bored and either want to raidpvp or build a big base after that though there is not too much you can do besides raiding and collecting airdropsgraphics are okay buggy but it is in alpha sound is okay gunshots sound nice but might need tweaking explosions need tweaking not to many glitches and i have had no crashes my self netcode seems fine heaps of servers with little lagbasically dont get this if you hate games like Nether and dayz unless you find a nice helpfull server or you dont understand what alpha is and have a short attention span i have had fun with it but it has reached a point where there is nothing new for me to do appart from kill people atm probs not worth 20 for what content you actually get but it will be interesting how they expand this and could be worth more then that in the future"

Dota_2,"heyguysas a long time addict i would like to give a honest though undoubtedly biased review of this gamelifestyledrug playing this game is like taking yoga for 5 years training mercilessly day and night then finally surgically removing a rib in order to one day suck your own heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit only to discover that the relentless physical torment has left your junk in a hapless defective state what you will experience from playing this game is 99 flaming scapegoating and being killed by players more invested in this video game experience than you could ever hope to be the majority of mechanical gameplay consists of attacking an aicontrolled unit at the last possible moment in order to obtain a pitiful amount of gold from it and then proceeding to repeat this action hundreds of times every single game still interested i will not question what may be wrong with you but seeing as you have read thus far i will let you in to this little secret the reason why people have played this game since its inception and have never gotten bored of it this is the little 1 of pure untampered ecstasy it is the moment that the scales fall from your eyes to reveal the next level of complexity within the world of dota you once believed to be much simpler the moment you first overcome your opponent with skill you have sacrificed your blood sweat and tears to develop when the stars align and that wombo combo aces the 5 heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit boys stupid enough to challenge you and your brothers in arms when you comeback from mega creeps a checkmate in nearly all cases to snatch the victory which dangled so precariously in the jaws of defeat followed by talking so much heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit to the early good game flamer on the other team your mouth may as well be a colostomy bag this is the high you will achieve from this narcotic we call Dota_2 and you will without a doubt spend the rest of your life crawling miserably through the toxic sewerage ala public games in order to once more experience it in all of its richness and warmth truth be told there is no guarantee that you will ever feel that same way again but its worth trying i think"

Team_Fortress_2,"an interesting fps tower defense game light hearted and witty commentary and voice lines unique story and easychallenging levels of gameplay for both novice and experts alike the graphics are beautiful and have a very Team_Fortress_2 look and feel to them ive logged over 70 hours in this game and have gotten every achievement and i still have new maps to play new weapons to use and different strategies to implement i definitely recommend this game as its hours of fun for you and a friend if you wish regardless of what way you like to play up close and personal or further back and let all your traps do the work this game can cater to you but whatever method you choose to use just remember these orcs must die"

Super_Meat_Boy,"the rage Super_Meat_Boy is probably one of the most ragequitty games that i have ever played yet i still play it and try to beat the levels that i have rage quitted on in many occasions its a fun arcadeadventure game with many levels and bosses but dont judge a game by its cover it is bloody gutty vommity and ragey it even has squirrels and rabbits jumping into saws so get this game and enjoy it if you can RIRE"
Team_Fortress_2,"another great game by valve Team_Fortress_2 to me seems like an fpsrpg first person shooter role playing game because you can choose between 9 classes each with different special abilities you can also buy find and do something else that i am not aware of to get items which range from humorous hats to show off to your friends to curious crates which may hold something special within i definately recommend this game to all you pyrotechnicians and assassins and everything in between because this will give you endless hours of fun"
Team_Fortress_2,"this is the type of game that can make anyone addicted especially a low life like me gameplayin Team_Fortress_2 you play as one of the 2 teams red or blue and choose beetween nine classes each having a specific role the speedy scout the idiot soildier the mysterious pyro the drunken demoman the russian badass slash cuttie patotie heavy the layback egghead engineer the helpfull though slightly crazy medic the australian steriotype sniper and the fancy guy that looks more like he should belong in payday then he does in a game spy you can collect weapons to dominate your oponents and hats dont even get me started on hats theres a good reason as to why this game is also known as hat simulator there are so many hats that not having one is considered a sin no matter how good you are at the game if you have no hats or are running around wearing a gibus with pyrovision googles and a mecanery badge sorry but your a newb you play in a majority of fairly straight foward matches and different match types control points capture the flag payload king of the hill doomsday and the most unique being the rage inducing mann vs machiene this game is high on teamwork and your gon na get your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kicked if you go in alone it is also noticable that there are many mods that keep the pros around like the slender mod the deathrun mod and the jailbreak mod even though g mod had all of these first this game will keep you playing for a very long time due to the constant updating of new material and bugs to play around withcharacters each character is very different each other they all originated from different countrys besides the scout the soildeir and the engineer that resides in the us and they all brought theyre steriotypes with them and theyre atitudes and playstyles are so different its almost hard to beilieve that they get on fairly well graphics this is not the type of game that consentrates on being beutiful but the cartoon violence itchy and scratchy type gore is in high enough definition to satisfy most people looking for gore and yes there is a difference beetwen cartoon gore and horror gore replayability yes definitly you play as one class you get bored of that class you go on to another class and once your bored of all the clases your ready to try the first class again and as i said before this game keeps on updating keeping valve quite busy maybe thats why half life 3 hasnt been anounced also there are so many mods so many different maps and so many non porpuseful tactics cough friendlyism i just cant stop if you want a game that is fun and will last you years before you have done everything and has you slowly clawing your way to the to the top and where you meet freindsvaluable trading partners go for it its free and is very cheap too go premium gameplay 910graphics 710overall 810 play it"
The_Community,"im surprised the overall ratings for this game arent negative or mixed yet still a decent game though just buy the game and dlcs during a sale to actually play the game without spending a lot of moneyeditsince update 100 came out and microtransactions were removed the game is now going back to its roots overkill listened to The_Community and that the next generation of safes will be completely free except for the old gen youll still need to use a drill to open them the revamped skill trees introduced by update 100 have changed the way you play the game in my experience at least some skills were nerfed inspire others were buffed sentry guns and some were merged with other skills in a way this new system allows more roleplay and tactics during heists oh and the update made akimbos and the saw to be usable by default which should have been in the game from the start anyway overkill also announced that they now own all the rights to the payday franchise which means that theyll support the game throughout this year to the end of 2017 i dont know whatll happen to the game at this point overkill gained most of their fans back and they support them in return so i guess that the game will survive after all"
Team_Fortress_2,"dirty bomb is a free and very enjoyable fastpaced action shooter right up there with the likes of Team_Fortress_2 the game is fair on all player skill levels youll find many servers with a level cap ensuring that everybody gets a fair chance there are microtransactions in place but there is no emphasis on using the system as all items that can be purchases using real cash may also be purchased using ingame credits whats more is that these credits are earned very quickly and there are often events such as double xp and random loot drops which ensure that evey player gets the same opportunity to see what these toptier items are like yes i am aware that at the time of this review being written my playtime hours are rather low but that is mainly due to the fact that i am playing on old system while making do with a subpar internet connection with that being said i have made sure that i have explored most of what the game has to offer and i can come to the conclusion that diry bomb is a great game that deserves a place in everybodys steam library and after all its free"
Portal,"nothing comes close to the entertainmentmoney ratio that Portal 2 raises the bar to at least in the puzzle genre worth buying at any price"

Portal,"red trigger was an awesome experience its got a mysterious yet intresting storyline tough but good puzzles its also one of the few puzzle games that require timing making the game more unique interesting and worth playing i would love to see a concept like red trigger become a big game that lasts hours like Portal 2 its short but only made by one person with a tiny bit of assistance by others definintely an 810 especiialy because its free"

The_Community,"for those not familiar with what squad is its essentially the new version of project reality which was a bf2 mod back in the day and is now a stand alone title that focuses on realism patience and teamwork however the game is quite dated now and has needed a serious upgrade like this for a whilesquad is currently in its alpha and while it looks much better than pr its stripped of a lot of the features that make pr so great but rest assured these will be coming in the future ie vehicles even in alpha the game is well worth the price youre not going to find a more realistic team based modern shootersimulator outside of arma but in many ways this is much more accessible than arma as you dont need a clan or a good sized party to enjoy the full experience if you have yourself a good team who work together and know what theyre doing then youre going to have a lot of fun with the game however there are a lot of new players right now who dont know how to play the roles so some games can get frustrating most players here as in project reality use mics and youre not really going to get by without one so i recommend you have one before purchasedisclaimer this game requires teamwork communication and patience you might go an hour without getting a single kill and thats fine this isnt battlefield do not purchase this if youre not familiar with the likes of arma project reality or red orchestra or if youre not willing to learn the maps are huge with thousands of possibilities and choices when it comes to strategy and tactics the weapons are accurate sound effects are almost too real teams work together and you can see some amazing things in this game with a little initiative from squads The_Community is friendly supportive and willing to help always this is only alpha and theres so much more to come but for now what other game on steam can let you build a 50 cal position on a mountain top and rain fire on enemies kilometres away while your buddies help you with targeting and adjustments"
The_Community,"i have sunk 20 hours into this beta i dont think i have ever done that for any game in beta chosing to wait until it is a finished product but this was simply the 4x game i was looking for at the time and there are some reasons why it stands apart from other 4xs at the moment and why you might want to think about getting itunit customisation in gc3 you make military decisions from your technology choices through to the artistic choices you make for your units do you want lasers rail guns missles armor plating shields are you going to have terran looking cruisers or the most alien creations you can imagine i had a truely fun time every opportunity i had to design a new shipstar bases probably one of my favourite aspects of gc3 were the use of star bases having extra things to throw resources at when a planet has filled its current building possibilities was great and i think is missing from other 4x games there are though many finishing touches to be made to gc3 but with The_Community around it the mods that will come should make this game the 4x in space game every one has been waiting for jump in and have a play you would be hard pressed to be disapointed"
The_Community,"alright ill be completely honest herei had a lot of faith in this game when i bought it the constant updates every day or so The_Community etc until about a month or two after when updates basically halted to once every three weeks and with every update that brought content or fixes another bug would arise this game is great in its concept however leaving a game that has its whole backstoryinfluence to a russian guy is like letting an indian direct a movie about the american civil war it makes no sense whatsoever this game had so much potential for growth however it looks to be just a cashgrab for the dev as he seems to be focused on making another game and it looks to be that he is pretty much porting stuff from that game and putting it in dsjhonestly buy it if youve got the dosh to spare but dont expect much"
Portal,"who knew that a game that classified as an open world space sim could be scarier than all of the fnaf games combinedanyway onto the story after many legal trading missions with low reward i decided to do just one illegal mission it was to take 4 slaves to the neibouring system easy enough the first halve was simple as i flew close to full speed out of the station and jumped into hyperspace how hard could it be i thought to myselfout of hyperspace and heading to the starport then out of the corner of my eye i see a direct message from a federation navy ship telling me that i was a suspect and will intredict me at that point my heart was already in my mouth and the other ship about to pull me out of supercruise i finally pulled myself together and managed to line up with the escape vector still in supercruise and the navy ship is still after me the interdiction was easier this time the navy ship left me aloneuntill an enemy tried to intredict me and succeeded i thought i was as dead as the companion cube in Portal but somehow he didnt want to fight this newbie and left me alone the rest was a breese as i docked the ship and spammed the starport services button to recived my pay1312 would get this lucky again"

Terraria,"hurr durr Terraria no really its a good game"
Evolve,"this is a really fun game packed with action and suspense Evolve consisit of 5 classes my favourite is trapper so i highly recomend this game"
Dota_2,"Dota_2 is a fun rageinducing game that requires imo around 50 hrs to grasp the idea and mechanics of the game with over 100 characters to learn master and build to the situation the game offers endless possibilities with a skill bracket ranging from complete and utter n00bs to that of professional players beware though you can be sucked into the game and possibly ruin your life RIRE"
The_Community,"ridiculously fun game spells are powerful but defenses are equally powerful so its always a matter of outthinking and outplaying your opponent the best part is the decision to exclude a mana system so theres not really any micro management going on the developers really listen to The_Community and are very public with what they are working on and going to work on"

Half_Life_2,"how to describe this source mod of Half_Life_2well first its quite a unique game one that you dont see too often anymore purely atmospheric with some very appealing lighting and graphics there is little to no music in the game leaving you walking through a quiet and somewhat eerie area even so this sets a perfect atmosphere calmly yet it still keeps you on your nervesadmittedly the story is somewhat cliche but is still portrayed quite well as you progress through new areas you meet a few new people who give you small tasks that help you towards getting off of the stranded island you are on with an unknown company blocking any outer communication these characters are not always friendly some attempting to kill you just trying to survive in this perilous land the voice actors are brilliant bringing life to the game and to the characters they playthe graphics in this game are while not perfect and somewhat buggy still quite beautiful there were multiple occasions where i would sit there for a few minutes and gaze out into the virtual horizon taking in the quiet beauty the lighting used in the maps are just worthy of a comment in itself dark areas have a dark glow to them while the happier lighter areas have a nice bright tinge to them the infected are somewhat bland looking as though they came from star trek and just have glowing yellow eyes but they dont pose a threat they are more there to remind you of the reason that you are thereas a total game i found this to be quite impressive i highly recommend this game to those with a passion for atmosphere considering this was made with the hl2 engine and is only the first act of many to come i can only wait in anticipation for the next few acts this game has impressed me quite a lot with it unique atmosphere and dramatic music as a total this game brings back what was missing in the gaming community atmosphere modern games incorperate as much action as they can sometimes not letting you take a break and take it all in but this game lets you play and take it in at the same time very impressed with this game cant wait for the next acts"

Dont_Starve,"it is a great game i suggest getting it it might just be me but i am completly addicted to this game i think it could be improved by being able to create your own chracter and and build a base settlement as i think it kinda suits the game i think if there where more npcs quests and a choce feature being able to change the main story just a bit i think that it would be a bit better but all these suggestions are what i would like to be implemented to the game but over all i think its a fun game in which you could have alot of fun with friends or on your own forever alone in my opinion it is a realy good game but that is my opinion it wasnt as hardcore survivail that i would like it to be there is water food items every where its good if you just want to play it casual but not the best game if you want to play hardcore chuck norris style over all i play alot of zombie games like dayz deadrising dead island state of decay and left 4 dead but also a lot of survival games like rust Dont_Starve and neather and overall i give it 710 freedom 810 survival 810 graphics 710 story 910 awesomeness"

Csgo,"this game is a absolutely great game but when it comes to competitive you get heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ed up extremely easily because of smurfs smurfs in Csgo is basically someone that is a high rank on their main account but then they buy an alternate account and buy Csgo on that account to play with unranked or silvers first rank you start off with i dont know why its called smurfs but thats just what its called besides competitive this game is a master piece the first 2 counter strikes were awesome and still are but i would take Csgo instead of the recent counter strikes Csgo brought in skins for the guns you use ranging from 1 cent 200 up to 100 at the most Csgo is just a great game and i would recommend you get this great game and thats all i have to say so good luck and have fun"

Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"now before i begin i havent played either of the two dlcs that add a couple extra missionsrecently during the christmas sale i purchased xcom enemy unknown and proceeded to play the living crap out of that game pretty much making it rule my christmas a few days later i saw this game on my queue and decided to go ahead and buy itthe bureau xcom declassified not only has a hard name to spell but is also a great game for a prequel to enemy unknown and the general xcom franchise for the casual gamer such as myself this game provides quickmedium length missions which are generally 2040 minutes meaning i dont get stuck for hours in game like i do for say civilizations v or Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive if youre looking for a casual game that includes a very wellmade squad command system thats not star wars republic commando seriously check it out its amazing and you dont mind the third person perspective then this game is for yoube warned this game is not an xcom game quite far from it its a well made and fairly challenging prequel to eu ive been playing on normal but from what ive gathered via others veteran mode is a fairly difficult challenge originally you will have some fps issues if youve got a toaster like myself set a couple of the graphics settings to medium or low and youll be hitting 60fps in no time some of the early levels during this game are retrieve this or save him etc but the mid to late stages of this game make it well worth it the combat is relatively annoying at first especially when you face the spoilers sorry 3 for strategiestactics ive mainly relied on the scoutcommando classes due to their abilities being useful no matter where they are on the map pros nicely paced game that doesnt stray too far from what we know and love about xcom agent carters hat is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing amazing if it gets knocked off you can even hit e on it to pick it back up amazing fits in well with the enemy unknown timeline in certain places ill come back to this later nice combat mechanics and the alien ai really knows what their doing set in the 60s how many alien games are set during the cold warvietnam war era squads can be trained up to reach high levels and you can collect alien equipment to arm them the hatcons storyline for me so far can be a bit clunky some fragments of the storyline dont fit with enemy unknown total campaign is estimated at probably 10hrs of gameplay for a casual gamer but this comes to personal preferance squad commands are a bit hard to get used to cant keep agent carters hat on for the whole game storyline issues slight spoler warningwhile i do recognize that the xcom saga hasnt been known for its whole lore shizzle whizzle some things dont add up during the events of xcom enemy unknown it is stated by dr vahlen that they have never seen these aliens before hang on a sec this is set in the 60s while eu was in 2015 i realise that firaxis2k may not have anticipated that this game would overide their original script for eu during enemy unknown we must also research plasma and laser technology however i can bring home weaponry that includes both laser and plasma based weaponry to conduct research overall this game started out fairly well with me but after a while it came out brilliantly the story revolving around the main character is a bit clunky and doesnt make sense with eu and ew however id reccomend this game to the casualcompetitivediehard xcom gamer who wants a 3rd person tactical game that has the backing of a major developer such as 2koverall rating 710thank you for reading this if you stayed this far ive been considering starting a curator pageyt channel so let me know what you thinkps muton elites will literally destroy you unless you spam the living heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out of it"

The_Community,"this game has a lot of room to grow what with its short playtime and whatnot however the gameplay is particularly fun and engaging and the game comes with a level editor that enables The_Community to build their own content for the game my hope is that in the future the game will be even more moddable which would make it even more expansive and fun"

The_Community,"this game is horrible and full of cheatsevery server i went to there were players flying in midair hovering around in midair and one shot killing me and other players even with both anticheats systems in place lots of people still hack in this game which makes the game unplayable and unenjoyablea typical run in rust begins with you running for 2 minutes then being head shotted or instantly killed by a fellow player this is what happens 90 per cent of the time to players who dont hack while the cheats can do as they please because they are armed to the teeth The_Community in this game is a joke more like a community of trolls and angry children which most people just kill you for the hell of it there is no team work or friendly people to build alliances with in this game and it in the end becomes a battle between you and the hackers hacker groups which you dont stand a chance to sum this game up is to say that it is a run and get gunned down simulator unless of cause you use hacksdont waste your money on this crap game it will be 20 dollars down the drain"

Tf2,"after playing hours and hours of the old ace of spades see buildandshootcom i bought this game with high anticipation and excitement sure this game is a minecraft Tf2inspired fps combat that feels relatively new in a genre that is completely overratedits fastpaced combat certainly sets it away from a crowded fps genre and its zombie mode is surprisingly the best mode in terms of balance and fun another positive is that it offers map editing and the ability to share custom mapssadly each of ace of spades four classes certainly have their pros and cons which significantly imbalance the game depending on gamemode for example the rocketeer jetpacks across the map with an smg in capture the flag which seems unforgivably lopsided furthermore the minecraft building aspect seems untouched and is hardly used which is also hampered by a bugged reticule"
Tf2,"awesome game to me loadout is an extremely customisable version of Tf2 with a bit more cartoon blood just like borderlands 2 the range of weapon and character customisation isenormous and the fact all weapon customisation options are available to all people is amazing gameplay is fun and very fastpaced making for quick and exciting combat that is excellent esoecially for casual gamers only down sides are that character customisation costs unless you get items through daily prize and sadly it is difficult at times to find an active match of humans vs humans apart from these loadout is a fantastic game many of you should try7510 very good"

The_Community,"the best word to describe verdun would be brutal but in a very very good wayoverall opinion fantastic historical a damn good game and well worth the price if its on sale its a mustverdun one of the most historically acurrate games ive ever played from being hit by gas attacks to being shot mid stride and watching your body slump down into the mud and battling it out in trench warfare on some of wwi most know battlegrounds most weapons are extremly satisfying to use with most rifles downing a charging enemy or and entreched one in one shot pistols maybe taking 2 shots on average but having the advantage of being semiautomatic making pistols extremly formidable even at long range this game will make you work espically in the trench warfare mode where this game comes into its own you will push up to cover or the enemy trench most likely die in the process but you know youll do it again because there is that chance you will make it into that cover or arrive into the enemy trench bayonet at the ready verdun succeeds in creating a very tense atmosphere from merly lying in nomans land waiting for your squad or slowly creeping through the enemy trench knowing that your probably going to get shot from behind you and your team will have to rtry and detremine which part of the enemy trench is the least defended or create a space for your team mates to enter the teams i have played on usually worked together i havent really noticed much toxicity which is a postive thing and i hope it stays that way although it can be daunting for new players as getting shot from seemingly no where can be frustrating and not hitting your mark on long shots because you werent compenstating for bullet drop and travel time can be slightly most players will pick things up like compesation and not standing straight up at the edge of your trench or in the middle of nomans land overall this is a history buffs wet dream and damn good shooter very solid for an early access game although its missing a few minor things id love to see them add more battlefields and more forces like gallipoli which would hopefully cause the devs to add the anzac forces to the game for which the australian and new zerland members of The_Community would be very grateful for also the addition of more blood and gore would add to the already fantastic immersion im sure the decs will continue to polish and improve this game and i cant wait to see what it becomes"

Metro_2033,"now before i start on about this game for those of you that straight want if the game is worth to buy i would say it isthe game is a sequel of the game Metro_2033 and based off the comic book series metro compared to the first game i would say it has improved alot the first game was extreamly buggy where i spent most of the time googling how to fix this bug and such this game its simply restart last checkpoint i loved this game how i was so interested in the story was so great i just wanted to delve into it more although short campaign there is side story missions which may give a few more hours of play into the expirence"

The_Community,"excellent game recommended for people who like moba massively online battle arena games it involves teamwork as well as skill inorder to play this game and although it takes quite some time to master and learn the basics of the game but once you get the hang of it it really is something interesting although The_Community is a little toxic and harsh however once you get to the higher levels or you play with friends it will definately be an enjoyable experience overall i rate this game a game worth trying as it is really a gem in itself and be it old or new players there is always something new to learn"
Csgo,"counterstrikeglobal offensive is a tactical firat person shooter i personally enjoy Csgo because how it is a mix between aim and strategy this allow this game to much more in depth and enjoyable also Csgo has every gun available from the start so no player has an advantage this makes Csgo all about how good you are and your team teamwork is essential in Csgo thats is something i find is needed in todays games working as team not indiviudally Csgo is a very well thought out game and will always be remebered by me and the gaming community"

Csgo,"has to be the best fps ive ever played infact its probably up in my top 5 games of all timeto start im not a serious hardcore gamer but this got me really addicted and have played over 20 hours in the past week i mostly play competetive and deathmatch but theres also other modes such as casual if you dont want to be involved in ranks or waiting for the 20 hour cool down after playing too much competetivedont get intimidated by the fact of buying guns and knives because they are simply just skins and dont give the player that spent 400 on a knife any advantage over the player that spent 0 however the cool thing about steam is being able to sell cards and other items which you can use to purchase weapons or buy crates and keys to have a chance to win better guns and knivesyou do get a few hackers and afk players every know n then but they are easily kicked with the easy team voting system the main problem i have is smurfs which are players that make other accounts and may seem as a low rank but actually have a higher rank making them unfair as they play with lower ranks even though they are much more skilledfinally gamplay the gameplay is very smooth and well thought out low rank players play with low rank players and high rank players play with high rank players all guns have their advantages and disadvantages such as long range short range recoil damage fire rate and accuracy each map has well placed objects which can be used as coveroverall this game is a must i reccommend Csgo to any fps gamer or even any average gamer in general"

Tf2,"this game is unique it is like bringing a mmorpg to a fps game and it is amazing the way valve design this game is brilliant every class and weapon has its own strength and weaknesses plus adding things such as taunts and hats makes it more fun and hilarious but the most amazing thing about Tf2 is that you can be an idiot or a fool and no one will get mad even sometimes people will be a idiot with you it is a game nothing like coc or rift it is a legit fun game where you can laugh your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off and never get bored especially with friends i highly recommend it"

Dota_2,"ah valve why do you torment us so Dota_2 is a moba as many people would probably know due to this game being the most played on steam Dota_2 is a solid game and i would say due to the nature of the games genre being a rather unpopulated market the best one in the moba genre i say this for a couple of reasons but i will list those later Dota_2 stills holds much to warcraft 3 the game it was based off of now Dota_2 attracts me for a few reasons those being its very simple but effective party or solo play the potential profit that is able to be made and of course my affnity for strategy games being a free to play game Dota_2 is amazing valve did a brilliant job n it and altough things could be improved in some areas it is still a perfect example of what valve is capable of pros excellent combatvariety of heroesvariety of itemsexcellent party system gripping game that has the potential to reach high tension when victory is unclear level system works wellpurchaseable items are only for cosmetic effect keeping the game balanced potential gold mine for economically minded playersconssome broken heroesmatchmaking theyll never get it rightcommunity is mean to newcomerstutorial is boring and does little to encourage playverdict 910 one of my favourite games on steam if they just fixed up the minor things wrong with the game itself it would be more deserving of a better rating"
The_Community,"its about time i reviewed this game europa universalis iv is simply amazing i pour a lot of my extra time into this game and are never disappointed with the game the newest update to euiv added a lot of new features for free something that is rare in this age of gaming developer support simply the best ive seen in years paradox are one of the few companies that dont milk their customers for money and actually listen and respond to The_Community euiv is updated regularly and every now and then a massive update comes out even though this game has an incessant amount of dlc dont allow that to throw you off unlike the civilization franchise of late you need no dlc to enjoy this game much of the dlc is for a more in depth experience and reminds me of a crowdfunding system graphics the graphics of euiv arent going to win any awards anytime soon but they fit the game and its genre most of the graphical elements within euiv is the map itself and there is decent detail for this military units naval and army are rather generic and bland and this is where the main clump of dlc comes in most of the dlc are visual enhancements to the game adding varied unit appearances in terms of the gui i personally love it the gui without any menus up is rather spartan but provides all nescessary information to the player with menus however is where euiv shines the menus are complex and indepth easy to navigate and sometimes a bit unclear difficulty ill say it now if you have no patience you are probably not going to like euiv the game has a steep learning curve in comparison to most strategy games and that can be accredited to the game sitting by itself in its own subdivison on strategy it is neither and rts or tb but rather an rts that is pauseable ruining the entire purpose of an rts to new players menus can be confusing and war may be a major attractor to new players personally i say learn the menus first then unpause the game gameplay gameplay in euiv can be boring if you let it be most of the time the game attempts to keep you involved with events and issues around your country ive had a friend turn away from this game due to them not bothering to learn the menus and hopping right in as sweden then he immediately declared war on his overlord not pretty war is painful in this game to conduct properly and to be honest it is extremely hard to play as a noneuropean civilisation once the colonial countries come all in all euiv is worth every dollar with an excellent developer who supports their game and listens to The_Community and an invloving behemoth of a game it is truly worth the 40 i payed"

Dota_2,"Dota_2 has been the most addicting game ive played till now besides for minecraft ive played around 100 games although not many ive been playing with a lot of heroes the only problem ive seen is that some hero is really annoying especially rikimaru rikimaru can be countered with wardsdustgem and really squishy in early game but in low ranked games people dont know that they usually just stay there getting xp and then when riki blinked strike them they run away and let riki get fat i really suggest nerfing riki a little bit early game just to make him really squishy make him not and easy hero too nerf his skill a little bit so people dont always win after getting a fat riki overall this game is awesome i seriously recommend it for you people"

The_Community,"i have noticed in the review section of this game that a lot of people are giving this game more of a negative rating rather than positive which is quite frankly true pre patch 137 7810patch137 10patch 137 was supposedly to make the game better in the way it was more balance RIRE infact it made it worse throught my few hours playing the game after patch 137 i have come to believe that gaijan have become greedy like activisiontreyarch in the ye old days like 129 you could quite easly come out of a match making around 1020k profit depending on whether you have premium or not i not saying this because im bad but here are 3 reasons why gaijin had screwed up the game after patch 1371 matchmakingafter 10 games in the new patch im not sure if it was unlucky or absoluty garbage i prefer to play in the british line up while using stuff like the wellington beaufighters ect the problem i was having is i would get over the bombing target in my wellington ic and then be killed by 8 fighters who can climb to your altitude within a matter of minutes which resulting into easy killsaircraft have now been sorted in tiers rather than ranks you may think that is true but infact its the complete opposite the aircraft may be a tier 3 but the battle rating which can be found while hovering over the aircraft is the acctually ranked lobby you will be put in for example the mustang mk1a which is a british fighter is a tier 4 but its battle rating is 53 they say they would be changing this but can we really believe them2 leveling upprier to patch 137 if the people who are reading this just started you had ranks rather than tiers like any game you get kills lionsxp more aircraft kills which was all good you could quite happly level up now you need to research the aircraft the developers said this new system would acctually help you unlock aircraft quicker wrong infact it would take you 45x long to get a single plane in the game for example the f80c shooting star you need 3200rp to unlock if you get an average of 13k rp for that aircraft note not all rp earned in a game goes towards an aircraft the rest is stored so you can use it later but there is a twist it would take you atleast 100150 games to unlock and a normal game goes for 20 mins20x15031002441 so it would take you around 12 days of non stop gameplay to unlock it lies3pay to playas this person has explained beautifully on the war thunder forumsso let me sum up it here instead of playing and enjoying the game gaijin wants the players to 1buy gold 2buy premium 3 play the game a lot 4 realize you cant do it without premium aircraft buy premium aircraft 5 lose your xx on repair bills because you cant use your fully upgraded lower planes for higher level plane research xp 6 use your golden eagles to buy lions at exorbitant rates 7 rinse and repeat stop locking these threads people need to know what gaijin did stop censoring the threads mods your job is not censor the posts of the paying members and communities response we all know the mods are purposely locking these threads trying to downplay The_Community response to this patch which is designed for one reason and one reason only to make the game take much longer and force a whole lot more golden eagle purchases we are not stupid we can see right through you digital zombielink httpforumwarthundercomindexphptopic89224researchreallyas you can see gaijin have become so full of themselfs they cant control what they have become without starting over many people would agree that dont waste your time on this game till they get there heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit togetherregards shifty"
Portal,"i really am not sure what to think of Portal 2 the charm of the first is lost though this doesnt make it a bad game at its core Portal 2 is a simple puzzler in an fps shell and offers a great distraction to more indepth gamesits definately not half life type awesomeness and i guess you need to expect that though i would sacrifice both Portal games for another entry into the half life universe i will put this just under bejewelled in regards to great puzzlers 70100"

Tf2,"when i first got this game i spend about 100 hours getting skills and getting ready to take on online people and pros this time was well spent as i was playing so much better than some players that went directly to multiplayer for new players offline bots do help a lotnow i was up to the stage where i felt that i needed that paidtoplay ptp so i went ahead and got it the second i got that ptp it opened up so much more of Tf2 than what it was like before ptp however after finding my first hat ptp Tf2 players will find that Tf2 was almost a mans dressup game or as most people would call it now a hat simulator as ptp it is important that you dont get fustrated when you dont get stuff you want even though you find items about 1550 faster than freetoplay ftp usersthen it happens again but this time you unboxed your first unusal everything changes again and the game becomes much more exiting i found that most players that have unusals kind of going to use a common ftp reference like to train and become better at that specific class as ftp you will see peeople wearing those unusals and become either jealous fustrated that they are so good and sometimes call them hackers and who knows maybe they are hackingbut overall you can worry about how good you look but just look good in those freeze cam and show how good looking you are but that shouldnt stop you actuly being a ftp and playing the game even though you are ptplastly what you should note about Tf2 is that it isnt repetive like some games like neverwinter etc there is always going to be new players with new styles of gameplay that makes this game very interesting too reguard less if they are ptp or ftpmy final thoughts this game is great also makes a good time killer if you have some spare time on your hands this game can keep you hooked for hours on hand and as ptp you do a lot of trading so sometimes is good to watchout for scamers or people in high demand for something in addtion this game is extreamly good looking as well in both gameplay and graphics Tf2 is going to be a hard one to beat 910"

Metro_2033,"long story short a runofthemill modern military shooter with a meaningless and short singleplayer campaign while neat with graphics and sound the 15 seems a bit too much on a rather easy and generic 6 hour game pass it unless youre very interesteddisclaimer while i havent played the sequel yet metro last light ive heard a lot of the narrative is improved upon with that game i have also not played the redux versions as of yetmetro 2033 is a first person shooter that takes place in the tunnels of moscow in the somewhat distant future you play as artyom a dude who is trying to get to the other side of the subway to save his hometown from mutants on the way you encounter bandits creatures and a strange supernatural entitywhile the goal of the singleplayer is made clear from the start it quickly loses track as you meet up with other characters and basically go through escortlike areas with them its hard to keep focused when youre constantly meeting different people and experience different kinds of gameplay for example one moment youre fending off a minecart from mutants the next youre sneaking through a bandit hideout stealthily killing each person you find the next youre walking down a corridor talking to a guy with very little coming at you each with some different npc leading you the whole journey feels disjointed and inconsistentthroughout the game you acquire a bunch of weapons most of these function a bit differently but some just seem outright pointless like the ball bearing shooter which can barely even damage enemies runs out of ammo quickly and occupies the same slot as the shotguns my biggest issue with the weapons is that theres very little variety theres nothing past pistols assault rifles and shotgunsthese weapons can be found on the ground alongside medkits which quickly restore your health and gasmasks which basically are a time meter for above ground sections my issue with the medkits is that the game is a coverbased shooter where all of your health eventually regenerates in gunfights with other humans medkits are only there to save time rather than hiding behind cover in fights with mutants medkits are pointless as the regenerating health mechanic pretty much saves you from any hits that the mutants do provided you dodge their attacks a bit all of these items are also sold in shop areas which appear in the first half of the game they oddly never appear again after chapter 4 i believe an interesting concept here is that bullets are the currency of the game my issue with this is that the kind of bullets that are used as currency are also the weakest bullets which removes the whole purpose of themso the gameplay has you going through a bunch of different locations meeting a few different kinds of enemies youll fight humans who all hitscan you if you move out of cover the gameplay for these guys is pretty generic and bland while their ai is good in moving into cover and such theres just no variety between them throughout the game the other kinds of enemies are the mutants theres a few different kinds but they all can only melee attack you making running backwards in circles and firing wildly an unfortunately effective method these enemies also deal a surprisingly low amount of damage even on harder difficulties making them very easy and nonthreatening targets which is a shame as theyre supposedly the huge threat of the storytheres also a few stealth sections in the game artyoms watch has a coloured light section that indicates how well seen you are but at least for me it doesnt work all that well theres been times where ive hit the red light and have still been able to run through unnoticed other times the light is green and i start getting shot at stealth is a very weak element of the game and fortunately or unfortunately it only comes up three times in the gameof course theres a lot of onrails sections where youre on some sort of moving vehicle and youre shooting at stuff these vary the story up a bit but in general are a bit easier than the rest of the game and lack the depth or challenge that youd be expecting during these usually explosive sequencesi dont know if its just me but i experienced a lot of bugs with the game theres the above stealth system which sometimes doesnt indicate the right thing ive had ai glitch up and run into walls constantly ive had times where a scripted sequence at the beginning of the game ended to my death ive had times where the ui would not come up the worst one i had though was that my gas mask would not come off my face which was okay at first however with the gas mask taking damage starts to crack the visor making it extremely difficult to see and since i couldnt take it off i was forced to play through literally half the game with my screen almost obscured loading a save or checkpoint wouldnt fix itgraphically the game looks alright depth of field and fancy lighting and particle effects makes the tunnels and overground look starkly different the sound is also done alright the music builds up at the right times although its pretty generic and the sound design works well as sounds echo in the tunnels and fade off in the overground sectionsunfortunately the engine can not make up for the games shortcomings Metro_2033 was not that enjoyable for me i played through the game twice once on hard and once on ranger hard which hides the ui and makes everything including you die very quickly both playthroughs were plagued with issues for me i didnt enjoy the game that much mainly because it was short and didnt offer anything substantial in terms of gameplayand thats a shame because my friends tell me theres a great story tucked away underneath it all its just i was too focused on the gameplay to really experience that theres a couple of side things to collect and theres a second ending that isnt purely a decision at the end of the game but especially the ending i felt that the game was giving me mixed messages about who was the good guy in the story which would be fine if it was a bit more clearcut what the implications of my decisions weremetro 2033 is a modern military shooter first and

Undertale,"i think that with the learning part of the game they should add a whole section dedicated to learning some manners and some resilience game is fun but randoms arent fun to play with get a group of friends go into a match and pray you dont get somebody who is abusive for little to no reason it says i recommend but my opinion is entirely 5050 there is a tldr down below im just going to have a rantthis game has it highs and a lot of lows the first game of the day you play might be pretty good you might get on a team that is rather friendly and you have a good match you play well everyone says gg and you leave feeling like you really accomplished something no matter if you win or lose that is the game trying to lull you in a sense of trust and happiness when it decides to throw a massive hardball of a game thatll leave you with more stress than if you ran a marathon while carting a wheel barrow after that you might do a few things 1 retaliate they might have the right to get slightly annoyed but clearly their reaction is like they have a wasp trapped inside their room and they are freaking out theyre opinion honestly doesnt matter and sometimes even trying to talk to them in a calm matter is utterly futile i would not reacting and ignore what they say because all youre doing is adding to your stress also when you react they usually start to feel justified in their actions and start to pile it on when you react we all lose think of those people as nukes because once they are set off we are all going down mutually assured depression2 try to redeem yourself in the next game youll play it is highly recommended you avoid doing this at all costs you might want to prove it to yourself that you can play good dont clear your head relax and find something else to pass the time until you find yourself in a calm mood heck im doing it as i write this because i might be the guy who starts yelling at somebody who doesnt deserve it instead im issuing a warning to all the people who are unfamiliar with mobas and want to try them this goes for all online games actually single player games dont yell at you for making 1 mistake except animal crossing mrresetti will give a mean scolding if you turn of your game without savingthis is a perfect summary of the experiences i have had playing this fun game with a rather toxic community espicially the people who are immediately racist to anybody that speaks another language some people should just change their name to klu klux ken or somethingtldrgames fun people suck im an heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit too i just happen to not be vocal about it and play Undertale or something play tug have a tug anything to avoid the toxic dota community and stay happy i guess"

Team_Fortress_2,"i find it halarious that this game lets you build anything at all from your imagination if you can afford it p enormous freedom to make anything and you literally about to build then you freeze realising you have no idea what to build the game lets yo make anything you want to kill players around the world with their designs and live to tell the tale the game makes you stressed when youre under fire from that one smg tank and youre worried about dying then a majestic plazma bomber saves you you regenerate from the helpful medic and heals you for the rest of the match and kill everything like a medic and heavy from Team_Fortress_2 the amount of weapons is helpful with missles smgs plazma launchers railguns aa guns and mediguns each weapon makes you play differently for every moment like railguns you need to be hidden and efficiant with shots however smgs youre going up close and doing as much damage to people as possible 1010 would recommend for creative intelligent people with the ability to think under pressure"

Portal,"if you come into this game expecting orcs must die 3 or something like RIRE or dota than your going to be dissapointed that doesnt mean this game is bad by all means its a great game the general gameplay of seige mode pvp is really fun the trap building is very cut down to a basic form compared to the other orcs must die games but adds a level of strategy to dealing with incoming waves this is understandable as your focus is on this pushhold gameplay style but to ultimately break through the other teams rift room jungeling in this is not really a thing its destroying caches and getting minion Portal upgrades which is essential to win and doing this playstyle means you need to know when to support your team during pushes survival mode is the pve gamemode where you defend your rift against waves of enemy minions this mode feels lacking especially if youve played the other orcs must die games most of the time if your team isnt dumb or your down a player you will win games dont feel long enough or are not difficult once youve figured out how to force minions the long way survival does need improvements and hopefully later in development it gets better not saying its not enjoyable just that gets bland after a 35 games in one play sessionfree to play means pay to win right no sure you can get a boost from paying for heros and chests but doesnt mean that if you dont buy you will have to grind to be good at the game the grind isnt too bad for traps and minions which determine your strategy of winning however for heros and other things will take longer to obtain in my opinion buying the calssic hero pack is not worth it and the grind for them is find for free to plays"

Dota_2,"what can i say after 100 hours i still feel unwelcome in the obnoxious community and still get absolutely stomped but i just can not put this masterpiece down defense of the ancients was a pioneer of the moba genre and its sequel remains a strong contender with the likes of smite and league of legends Dota_2 offers a pool of over 100 absolutely free heroes and both a casual and competitive approach however you choose to play the game youll be met with an array of toxic cussing and hateful individuals who will trash talk and rage at you for the simplest mistake a thick skin is necessary to obtain full enjoyment out of Dota_2 ignoring the savage community Dota_2 has perhaps the most engaging entertaing and satisfying gameplay ever it feels amazing to initiate a succesful teamfight or to just win a close game most heroes are balanced meaning most victories are owed to the skills of the players however a keen sense of mechanics knowledge is mandatory due to the games reliance on different damage types and various other integral factors whilst it can be difficult as a new player persistence and resilience can introduce you to many hours of fun for the best possible experience playing with friends will both save you from hateful people and allow you to synergise your strategies Dota_2 is free so you have nothing to lose from buying it except maybe your social life"

Csgo,"the first time i played Csgo i was incredibly disappointed i had just recently come from call of duty on the good old ps3 i couldnt aim down sights i couldnt run and gun i didnt know how to control recoil and i had no idea what callouts to say since i was useless at competitive i played deathmatch cod influenced me into playing dm where i was continuously shot from all different angles and was struggling to have a 05 kd my first 90 hours only had a few competitive games thrown in where i managed to win 1 of them however on the holidays my friends would mainly play Csgo and i joined in this time was when i began to appreciate Csgo as an amazing game it has so many features that many games simply do not have Csgo also has a thriving community with millions of people playing every month theres also the market there are so many weapon skins available this game has become one of my favourite games however there are some things that arent necessarily bad but some people may not like them such as the graphics deathmatch spawns and the skill level required to play well may be a large turn off for people if you do buy this game glhf"

The_Community,"payday 2 puts you and three friends in the role of a criminal gang who steal destroy kill make drugs steal some more and make lots of money doing so some missions are for the sneaky some for the control freaks and yet more for the just plain blood thirsty the missions are short yet engaging the atmosphere fun rather than immersive and the rewards simple more money more guns and more masks yes masks are a thing you would have thought they were just there to hide your face wouldnt you and you would be wrong but dont think about it for nownow it should be pointed out that you can solo this game but the ai is pretty bad in loud missions and the game really rewards playing with friends especially on the higher difficulty levels but probably the best thing about this game is The_Community and the development team for the game there are constant updates and new heists new weapons new skills and even new faces some of these will cost you and some are free but in the end for the sheer amount of time i have spent in this game and the fun i have had this game and all its dlc have been superb value for money gopher youtuberlivestreamersums it up well"

Nether,"from the zero punctuation reviewthere have been many rpgs that let you define your characters personality to a certain extent say youre given a quest to get a schoolgirls cat down from a tree on average youll be given three options neutral where you get the cat down and accept the schoolgirls allowance as payment good where you waive the fee and fondly tousle the schoolgirls hair as she scampers off and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit where you set fire to the tree and jump up and down on the schoolgirls faceand speaking as an heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit this offends me there are so many wonderful ways to be a complete ponce that these games rarely cater for why cant i rescue the cat but hold it to ransom for her dads porn collection or get the cat down by throwing rocks at it so it breaks all its legs on the concrete and then still expect to be paid with the infuriatingly infallible logic of a complete tosser why cant there be an rpg that covers the entire heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit spectrum well good news ponce fans now there isalpha protocol follows mike thorton a member of a covert us government agency with strong ties to a private military company that might as well rename itself kitten stranglers plc he gets betrayed goes rogue has to work alone to build a case against them blahdee blahdee blah but whats important is that however you play him mike thorton is the is the ponciest ponce that ever ponced past a poncing parlourthe dialogue system lets you switch between three attitudes a professional by the book sort of ponce who wouldnt emote if the angel gabriel blow off in his face an aggressive ponce who sounds like hes five seconds away from snarlingly flipping the global crisis onto its front and pounding away at its Netherhole with a franchi spas12 and the suave ponce who might as well just save time and mace himself every time he opens his heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing mouth best of all even if he only ever talked about his favorite breakfast cereal hed still sound like a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit because the voice actor delivers every line in the level smug tones of a highbrow film critic archly dismissing the latest superhero blockbuster as he spoons himself another helping of baby seallets get the good over with quickly for once this is a game that claims that every action has consequences and actually means a consequence more significant than a character maybe wearing a different hat for example although the hubbased mission system lets you do the operations in any order during the one i chose to do last an informant mentioned the previous operations id completed in conversation heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit i said this games just showing off now so i immediately became an aggressive ponce and slammed his head into a desk after which there was more security in my next mission because the informant went crying to his big brother or somethingthe rpg action stuff reminded me of deus ex in a good way its nice to see a game where your character has to work on their gun skills and cant expect to draw their pistol and immediately hit the on button on a tumble dryer from nine hundred years and i was also impressed by the lockpicking and hacking minigames which nicely balance skill and incremental difficulty and i cant think of a joke for that sentence so heres a picture of a dog in a hatthe thing about deus ex though was that you could arguably specialize completely in combat or stealth or hacking or playing the cello and still beat the game even the final encounter had equal parts monsters security systems and incomplete string quartets to allow any approach alpha protocol on the other hand is happy to let you sink all your points into learning to waltz only to find yourself stuck in an unavoidable freestyle disco competition i was a stealthclose combat specialist and there was this particularly obnoxious boss fight that i couldnt sneak out of and whose cqc attacks wrecked my heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit i had to inexpertly spray at him with an assault rifle i knew as much about as i did a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing nuclear reactor then whenever he got his knives out let him chase me around the room like benny heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing hillthe skills you can upgrade are stealth handtohand combat and then four kinds of guns which i feel makes little sense why the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit would anyone specialise in shotguns when a shotgun is a situational weapon what are you gon na do if theres an enemy more than ten feet away throw your shoes at himthe dialogue system gives you about one second to pick a conversational attitude that is summed up in one word and its often hard to decipher you might be talking to a sexy lady for eg when suddenly an option comes up reading say trousers and theres no way of knowing if this means the poncemaster general will change the conversation to the subject of trousers or draw attention to a specific pair of trousers sneaking up behind them or whatever so you select it out of panic whereupon el ponco promptly pulls his trousers down and slaps his bum while mooing like a lost calf spoiling your reputation with the character somewhatdialogue seems a bit buggy at times too which i guess is inevitable with conversation trees as labyrinthine as this there was a moment when i was gabbing away with another sexy lady when the option came up to initiate a quick knobbing which went down reasonably well then afterwards she started repeating dialogue lines shed been spouting beforehand wow i thought i literally heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ed her brain outthere are a couple of other bugs here and there like how the distinction between a wall you can take cover on and the ones with poncerepellent wallpaper is known only to mr thorton but none of them got in the way too much because after a while my stealth skill was so high i could literally turn invisible and run around instakilling every possible threat with my bare hands and nothing could pose a challenge after that short of the invention of some kind of ponceseeking missileall in all alpha protocol is weak and poorly balanced like a threelegged dog with an eating disorder but i want to come back to the story for a bit you know that extremely brief summary i gave about five paragraphs ago thats literally the extent of the plot i understood the rest was an incomprehensible miasma of factions motivations and betrayals through which i was just dumbly acting with zero understanding towards the end a line of dialogue got drowned out just before a boss encounter and i honestly didnt know if i was supposed to be killing or protecting the guy maybe this would be helped through repeat playthroughs oh sega you crafty heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit es"
The_Community,"payday 2 is easily one of the best multiplayer experiences i ever had i wouldnt call it the most polished game considering the single player aspect of it isnt the best due to the friendly ais inablility to do much except shoot and move around with friends or without multiplayer gameplay is insanely addictive and amusing however stealth is a bit finicky bugs are quite rampant and The_Community can be quite undesirable"

Csgo,"na epoca de seu lancamento era um jogo otimo porem agora o jogo recebeu varias dlcs abusivas com conteudos muito pequenos e que sem eles o jogo fica quase impossivel de se jogar na dificuldaade maxima e agora conta com microtransacoes para abrir caixas assim como o Csgo mas as pinturas vem com status para a arma resumindo estragaram o jogo"
Portal,"the best of its kindPortal 2 is easily the best puzzle game i have ever played you may think that im kidding because ive only played 26 hrs of the game but thats due to the switch of my computers this game includes knowledge and you need to have fairly good knowledge of angles reflexes and puzzling i am not a very good puzzler myself but this game is still the best hopfully this helped you in the process of thinking to buy the game during the quick sale that is going on right now"
Tf2,"at the moment this game is little more than a simple halflife 2 mod however the game is growing rapidy and after playing it for a little while you might grow to like itif you enjoy Tf2 csgo or other source based games you are probably going to like this game basically you work together in a team of up to 5 players to either plant a bomb and escape all the while fighting zombies bomb escape or hold out for as many waves as possible survivalgive it a try its free and not a massive download"

Team_Fortress_2,"i dont really care enough to write reviews but this game i found genuinely dissapointing i saw it on sale for about 16 the day before its release i remember seing the e3 presentation of the game and thought hey seems like it could be a nice mystery game with decent decision making that would effect the outcome along with some rather pleasent to listen to voice acting so i had an interest in this title but did it fare to my expectations nope heres whynow i am going to avoid spoilers because i respect that some will want to give this a shot themselves but i strongly recommend waiting for a sale like 500 sale im going to start off with the pros because despite my overall disappointed there are some commendable attributesprosvoice acting this is definitly the golden prize of the game interactions between henry rich sommer and delilah cissy jones are engaging and rather entertaining it definilty does a good job and genuinely making you feel involved in the characters relationshipsoundtrack the ambient acoustic guitar throughout the game never got tedious and kept me enthralled and quite relaxed art style a rather pretty lookng game i definilty sense heavy inspiration of Team_Fortress_2 especially in player model a modded asset from Team_Fortress_2 environment is pretty to look at but ultimately feels kind of lifelesstory acts one and two the sense of mystery surrounding the game specifically in the first two acts definilty made a rather intense ontheegde of your seat impact it was what drove me to keep playing till the end but this is where i get into the consconsnot enough depth i thoroughly enjoyed the first 40 minutes of playing i initially felt the game couldve had a lot to offer in terms of exploration i mean look at the map when you first get into the lookout it seams plentiful like thered be a lot to find and discover but unfortunately theres northing really to keep from following the rather linear pathway to keep the story rolling i didnt get the flashlight till near the end of the game and i pretty much didnt even need it lifeless when you start off and come across an elk and then a tree scratched to heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit by a grizzly i thought huh maybe therell be an encounter with a grizzly nope asside from the grantotal 3 npcs to come across there is very little wildlife present in these woods even though the game warns of these encounters they never occure everlength having finished the game in only 3 hours i finally understand angry joes contempt for short heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit titles ive often avoided them because they arent worth the asking price i honesltly hoped this wouldve been a bit longer 8 9 hours atleast illusion of choice one thing the game did interestingly was the choices of dialogue between henry and delilah but ultimiately this was meaningless and has little impact on endgame even the text based intro makes no difference whatsoever except for a naked sketch of you depending on how you choose pose thats itending sucked a game presented like this at least couldve had multiple endings theres only two and theyre both exactly the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing same all in all i give this game a 4 out of 10 its not really worth 20 if on sale for like 500 and you enjoy dialogue heavy games then maybe give it a shot but for the most part its pretty meh"
Tf2,"though im not exactly james mcvinnie at the source filmmaker it is a great little tool that allows you to completely change your view of the Tf2niverse to your will with models maps and animation the downside is that you have to have a really good computer to run this program and this isnt cannonfodder it is hard to learn it45"
Team_Fortress_2,"a game much like Team_Fortress_2 fistful of frags is a fun western shootemup which involves four teams to fight each other with ye olde weapons the game runs on the source engine which can lead to hilarious events with ragdolls and can cause some pretty spectacular kills355"
Csgo,"review on portuguese and englishanalise em portugues e inglesreview on englishanalise em inglessummary insurgency is a fps firstperson shooter game with tactical elements that tend to realism but can be configured to become arcade this depending on the server even the game not having a campaign to get more interesting its exclusively focused to the cooperative against aicontrolled bots and to the multiplayer against real enemiesentering the game the player can choose to join the insurgents team or to the security team both have their own classes weapons and customizations but even so the game can keep very well balanced during the matchcurrently insurgency has 7 different game modes in the multiplayer which the maximum server capacity is 32 players about the cooperative match the game has 5 different modes and the maximum server capacity is 8 playersgraphics as for the graphics we can say that is impressive to see how developers worked to optimize them to the maximum even with many elements present during a match the game doesnt need a very good pc to run the graphics stand out for being well modeled and with a excellent finish the details of the scenarios and weapons also impresses but it is impossible to compare them to new generation of games i think the graphics are similar to Csgo there are some mods at steam workshop that can slightly improve the graphics of the gamesounds audios another extremely positive point of insurgency is the quality of the sounds of weapons environments and explosions they can make you get fully into the game because it seems that you are in a real war and also you can download some mods in steam workshop that will improve the effect and the experience letting the game more real or funny ping fps the game has a really good rendering which makes it possible to run even on less powerful computers if you can run Csgo on low graphics at 60 fps probably can play insurgency without any problem and servers respond very well even with 200 ping you can play without perceive any difference or interference while the gameplaygameplay the gameplay of insurgency is a bit different because it tends to the realism so it becomes a bit more complicated than other fps games we are used to always being very fluid and responding well to the requested commands if you are new to fps games maybe you will pass a bit of difficulty cause you dont have a quick answer against enemies or even an advanced coverage notion yet to the veterans on fps games can be sure that insurgency will make you become better at basically every other fps you play or have playedthe physics in the game is a little weak it tries to hide some mistakes but it doesnt work so much for example the bodies dont react too well to bulletsi didnt find any individual cheating or doing some bugdevelopers assets and attentive the insurgency supportdevelopment team is an example always trying to help you with any questions or problems you have in the game unlike many other games the developersupport community of insurgency tries to maintain a intense contact with the public as an example they play matches with us you can contact them through steam if you need something which makes the service be much faster and easiercommunity in the sense of insurgency players community i can not analyze in relation to asian oceania or africa servers but the american all the america not only usa and europe community are very warm and friendly also very funny allahu akbar at every match that i played i didnt find any rager or any that harm your gameplay such as abusing the voice chat abusing the chat or kill his own team with intent the players community created and are creating a lot of mods to improve or vary your gameplay some mods are very hilarious also the artworks and screenshots created from players are very coolanalise em portuguesreview on portugueseresumo insurgency e um jogo fps firstperson shooter tatico com elementos que tendem para o realismo porem podem ser configurados para deixalo bem arcade isso dependendo do servidor mesmo com o jogo nao tendo uma campanha para ficar mais interessante a sua proposta e exclusivamente focada para o cooperativo contra bots controlados por ia e para o multiplayer contra inimigos reais ao entrar na partida o jogador podera escolher entre se unir ao time de insurgentes ou ao time de seguranca ambos possuem suas proprias classes armas e customizacoes mas mesmo assim o jogo consegue manter um balanceamento muito bom durante a partidagraficos em relacao aos graficos e possivel afirmar que e impressionante ver como os desenvolvedores trabalharam para otimizalos ao maximo mesmo com muitos elementos presentes durante uma partida isso nao o torna pesado de maneira alguma se destacam por serem bem modelados e com um acabamento excelente o detalhamento dos cenarios e das armas tambem impressionasonsaudios outro extremo ponto positivo de insurgency e a quantidade de riqueza e qualidade dos sons das armas ambientes e explosoes e possivel voce se imergir totalmente ao jogo por conta destes que o fazem parecer que realmente esta em uma guerra no workshop tambem e possivel voce alterar alguns sons de armas explosoes e outros efeitos para deixalo ainda mais realpingfps o jogo possui uma renderizacao muita boa a qual o faz ser possivel de rodar mesmo em computadores menos potentes se voce consegue rodar Csgo com graficos baixos a 60 fps provavelmente conseguira jogar insurgency sem nenhum problema e os servidores respondem muito bem ate 200 de ping e possivel voce jogar sem nem mesmo perceber diferenca ou interferencia durante sua gameplayjogabilidade a jogabilidade do insurgency e um pouco diferenciada e por conta de o jogo tender mais para o realismo ela se torna um pouco mais complicada do que outros jogos de fps que estamos acostumados sempre sendo muito fluida e respondendo bem aos comandos solicitados caso voce seja iniciante em jogos do genero pode ser que passe dificuldade para conseguir ter uma resposta rapida contra os inimigos ou mesmo uma nocao de cobertura avancada aos mais veteranos em jogos fps posso ter certeza que insurgency fara com que voce se torne melhor em basicamente todos os outros fps que voce joga ou ja jogou por conta da estrategia e velocidade de reacao que e necessaria durante a partidanao consegui encontrar nenhum individuo trapaceando seja com programas maliciosos ou com bugs no proprio jogodesenvolvedores ativos e atentos a equipe de desenvolvimento do insurgency e um exemplo sempre buscam lhe ajudar com qualquer duvida ou problema que voce tenha no jogo ao contrario de muitos outros jogos a comunidade desenvolvedora de insurgency tenta manter um contato forte com o publico jogando ate mesmo partidas juntos com outros jogadores e possivel contatalos atraves da steam caso necessite de algo o que faz o atendimento ser muito mais rapido e facilcomunidade no sentido da comunidade de jogadores do insurgency eu nao posso analisar em relacao a servidores asiaticos da oceania ou africanos porem a comunide americana toda a america nao so eua e europeia e muito amigavel e receptiva alem de muito engracada allahu akbar em nenhuma partida que joguei consegui testemunhar atos que prejudiquem o gameplay de outros como abusar do canal de voz canal de texto ou matar a propria equipe com intencao o jogo permite que a comunidade poste mods na workshop para diversificar e deixar o jogo com maior estilo do jogador assim como preferir"
Terraria,"every once or even sometimes twice in a lifetime you find that special game a game which you enjoy so much you just love it even if it isnt the greatest game for me that game is Terraria ive spoken to plenty of people who say it is fun but gets quite repetetive and its enjoyable but a lot of missed potential but to me its one of my favourite games ever since i bought it about 3 years ago its been near the top of my top 10 games ever ive clocked in over 520 hours in it and have enjoyed every single one this game is certainly worth the 10 dollar price but i would say its worth a lot morewhether playing alone or with your friends this game is sure to suck up hours of your time my biggest fault with it is that its not avalible for macs so i cant play it with all my friends but other then that its amazing i give it a 1010"

Well_There,"as one of the players during its time as a subscription model this was a enjoyable experience in terms of graphical fidelity this game has a beautiful backdrop and lighting effects and artstyle of somewhat cartoonishlook gives the models of both characters and monsters some justice and fits Well_There are 4 races and nine classes to choose from and each does have an interesting style for each one but some classes are locked for others and there is varying difficulty per class lore and narrative gameplay allows the player to actually meet many of the characters from the stories like strider gimli thorin oakenshield and gandalf the grey before their demise or journey in middleearth in the starting areas the loading screens also give some additional lore to what happens as players transition between townsi also love the music making system from lutes to harpsin terms of gameplay however this game is a hotkey setup and does suffer from some odd pauses in combat"
The_Community,"a fastpaced fastacting and very teamorientated game that revolves around pushing lanes with a diverse range of characters this game does enforce the idea of specialized characters known as pros and they each play very specific roles in terms of composition of your team each comes with 3 special skills and weaponary fitting the classes appropriately for example combat girl comes with a turret named combat kitty a combat laser and a turret buff each character also comes with a unique grapple attack that is quite fun especially if it involves throwing other players off the map commentators can get annoying at timesthere is a very and i mean very steep learning curve and unfortunately the tutorial does not give it justice for what happens in actual matches it does not hold your hand this may deter newer players and The_Community may actually push that considering they do not take kindly to newer players but like all games there are nicer people out there"

Team_Fortress_2,"" counterstrike global offensive " e um excelente jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa quem se lembra do game dos meados dos anos 200 vai se sentir em casa e divertido relembrar mapas como dust italy e train e da ate uma vontade de chamar os amigos para jogar em casamesmo assim e um jogo que mostra sinais da idade nao foram feitas atualizacoes nem adicionadas novas mecanicas que justifiquem voltar ao game que em sua essencia e o mesmo de anos atras vale para quem esta com saudades e quer variar um pouco da mesmice de jogar " call of duty " * pontos positivos *mecanica continua atualnao ha como negar " counterstrike " e um jogo extremamente viciante mesmo quem se afastou do game seja pelo motivo que for vai se sentir em casa afinal pouco da mecanica foi alterado e o que mudou foi para deixar o game mais realistaum desses exemplos e quando voce usa o telescopio dos rifles de precisao que deixa a tela um pouco embacada quando o personagem se movemas ha novidades tambem como a interface de compra que agora e circular o que facilita e muito a navegacao nas versoes para consoles novas granadas tambem aparecem como o coquetel molotov que da liberdade para criar estrategias diferentes no final das contas a mecanica de comprar armas em todos os rounds favorece quem joga com cautela e estrategicamentea versao de playstation 3 tem ainda suporte para jogar com teclado e mouse alem do controles de ps move ja no x360 nao existem tantas variacoes de controle nem suporte ao kinect e o modo de chat em grupo e desativado - afinal isso poderia ser usado para trapacas e " counterstrike " e um jogo que leva muito a serio a competitividadenovos modos de jogo " global offensive " traz dois modos novos o arms race e o demolition mesmo sendo bem distintos ambos compartilham de um descontraido espirito arcade e favorecem o confronto diretoem arms race o jogador ganha novas armas ao matar um adversario e passa por todas ate chegar ao momento que se ve forcado a usar apenas a faca sao 26 armas no total e vence quem conseguir usar todas elas com sucesso ou quando o tempo se esgotarja em demolition o esquema e o mesmo das missoes de explosao mas em cenarios menores e com mais contato entre os times alem disso o jogador so usa novas armas quando mata alguem do time adversarioem todo caso essas novas modalidades garantem um folego extra para quem e veterano e diversao imediata para quem ainda engatinha no game de tiro da valvevisual bonitocounterstrike global offensive e muito bonito e ate estranho dizer isso tendo em vista que a source engine uma ferramenta de 2004 ja nao faz graficos tao elaborados como a cryengine de " farcry 3 " ou a frostbite 2 de " battlefield 3 " cenarios como aztec ou italy sao bem detalhados e divertidos de serem revisitadosexistem efeitos de luz dinamica e fumaca volumetrica que enchem os olhos e esse resultado pode ser obtido mesmo em computadores com placas mais populares - leiase nao muito caraspor outro lado e notavel a queda de qualidade grafica nos consoles principalmente no playstation 3 que mostra texturas mais lavadas e com taxa de atualizacao em 30 quadros por segundo uma qualidade bem abaixo do que estamos acostumados a ver em jogos atuais* pontos negativos *poucas novidadesfaltam bons motivos para justificar o retorno de counterstrike por mais que bata a saudade de reunir amigos para um corujao em uma lan house fica a pergunta por que jogar global offensiveas duas novas modalidades e os mapas ineditos nao sao motivos suficientes para voltar ao mundo de " counterstrike " o mais provavel e que a longo prazo as pessoas continuem jogando o modo classico de " counterstrike " e nos mesmos mapas de sempre aztec dust italy etc e se divertindo como sempre aconteceu nas versoes 16 e " source " a situacao e ainda mais complicada para quem joga nos consoles que alem de nao poder jogar os mapas criados pela comunidade ainda corre o risco de ser abandonado pela valve como ja aconteceu com as versoes de " Team_Fortress_2 " para x360 e ps3"

Starbound,"Starbound is so far an excellent and beautiful little game with lots to discover and so many ways to do it the controls and game mechanics are dissapointingly hard to get used to for new players and while i appreciate a challenge getting started can be a long and boring process with death after death with barely a chance to start learning how the game works despite this players will find themselves coming back to this game over and over won over by its charm and always ready to give it another go despite the bugs the game is playable and its got a lot of potential the multiplayer is also pretty fun"

The_Community,"i remember playing this game a while back and thoroughly enjoying it i never got the full version however so when i saw kag on steam i was like oh boy a game that i liked better go buy it when it downloaded i opened it and already ran into a bug the games window was bugged i went to the options panel on the menu but nothing nothing about fullscreen or the resolution just controls and other nonsense it took me 5 minutes to find on google that you had to change it before pressing play on the little window that pops up why not just put it in the settings is it some sort of limitation on the software used to create the gameso after fixing up my resolution i decide to play a little bit of sandbox and god its horrible back in the old time of kag it had a simple building layout with 8 things on it simple and easy now you have all these wires and lamps and other bullcrap that dont actually need using what the hell is wire doing in a medieval game anyway i couldnt even select things properly they just select themself when you scroll over them this is when i quit honestly i couldnt give two damns about The_Community i just want that damn build menu fixed until then im going to have to give this a 210 why must you hurt me in this way"

Evolve,"this game is a sleeping hit more indepth review through the whole postprosstory great story great endinggameplay even tho it gets sturdy and there arent many combos you can do its still when time comes a fun aspect of the gamegraphics consvoiceacting was pretty bad mediocre at best if you want itexplosion effectscamera sometimes it can really annoy you how when youre fighting a boss it focuses and switches you from one place to the otherit starts of really fast and you kinda bump into a story theres no background theres nothing until you progress a bit through the game even then you will ask yourself few questions like how did i get here where i am what actually happend but even those loopholes that exist in the story are minority and should be ignored the game picks it up once you go past the first chapter the combat Evolves and you feel more connection to the characters for me personaly the way it was produced i didnt feel special bond between main character nor the girl that was with you all the time story is something definitely memorable and if nothing you should check the game only for that gameplay and graphics are something that are also mediocre i would say levels are linear so theres nothing really to add up to it gameplay gets robust after a while but whats interesting in this game is that there isnt that much of a combat as i thought it would be there are few puzzles here and there but thats pretty much it graphics are also for a game that came out in 2013 i would say pretty solid nothing spectacular effects when popping up the mechs arent fabulous but that doesnt stop this game to excell at what its best"

Dont_Starve,"the standard Dont_Starve experience wrapped up with a well balanced multiplayersome things have changed to rebalance the multiplayer and as such you will be surprised and disappointed with a few things it isnt as bad as you may immediately think as it is done to keep the feeling of dread that standard single player Dont_Starve was excellent at projecting more players easier as you all will be competing for resources whether youre playing competitively or notthe multiplayer is done very nicely as an australian who has been playing with americans these connections are known to be very laggy i was still able to function survive effectively and surpass my comrades there were those moments we all fear from long distance connections but they were few and far betweenbeing completely honest im very impressed it isnt easy to make a single player game into a fully functioning multiplayer version of itself ds was a 910 game for what it was and its execution dst makes it a 1010 because of how well it has translated the single player feel into a cooperative or competitive multiplayer"

The_Community,"this gameis probably one of the best early access games you can get on all of steam right nowbeautifully optimized looks great with unity5 worth the 20 mcdees family mealheres one such fun experience i had which had me and my mate laughing for half an hour straight pros cons at the line we were getting constantly raided on a modded aint nobody got time fo that vanilla stuff server we made a large town with the admins of the server and named it gastown it was probably the best settlement i ever built by far fair distance away from the beach slap dab in the middle of the desert landscape there are three in total snowice which wards off freshies and great for nighttime stalkin stalkers gon na stalk forestgrasslandshighlands for all the firsttimers who enjoy being in the presence of mutha nature and theres the desert desolate wasteland lots of quarry and pumpjack locations perfect for the marauders of the server and we had it all armoured tier 5 max protection up since we had more high quality metal than we knew what to do with we slowly invited people into our settlement of pumpjacks and mining quarries we slowly began to become the biggest band on the serverlong story short we got raided by ddosing hackers that kicked off everyone on the server including admins and flyhacked into our wellfortified complex then ending the kickwave and letting us spawn back into our bases to find that they were all c4d thats one of the many struggles of rust dem hackers eac seemingly does jacksht against these hackers vac just likes to create problems on all other games that dont use source but this is rust those who played the original alpha would have known that hackers were rampant in that thus one location on the old map dubbed hacker valley mainly because only hackers were able to get there in the first place like seriously who didnt hack back thenjokes aside we were kinda fed up about the whole ordeal so we took it upon ourselves and decided to go mess around with ladders and power pylons the big ones we ended up trying to spodermin up and trying to stand on it which we so hilariously failed hardcore but then we discovered we could put signs up on the pylons making a platform what was even better was that we could place furnaces n chests n sht up on these signplatforms we pretty much had the most heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ist base on the server hell even the owner decided to come base up with uswe always had plenty of freshspawns nudemans to harvest for food since they always tried to come up and raid us with rocks and spears yet we still held our ground with just crossbows and beancan gurrnades best moment of rust so farstorytime aside lets see the pros and cons of rust pros well built engine uses unity5 uses it well too plenty of different experiences each server you never will know what may happen on the next server you join lotsa gunz rust has plenty of guns to fit everybodys playstyle like going as the sniopah get a bolty like it upcloseandpersonal grab a shotgun or custom smg pathfinder grab a thompsonr250 rustedp250 and slap on a suppressor lightpacker grab the r250 and knock in some incendiary or explosive ammo you wont regret it wabbit sesunhunter grab a shotgun and load some slugs youll have plenty of newman carcasses to feed you for a whileas you see these are just some of my preset kits but ofcourse you can go ahead and go full pirate with the ak dress in red and go raiding make some of your own combinations weekly devblogs on whats going on facepunch does an excellent job of keeping The_Community uptodate on what theyre doing every friday of each week and we cant forget their trello trellocom page where they post their conecepts on where to go for rust and its great to say that the concept art they do is quite nicelooking too especially the trainyard radtown concept lookin foward to it guys every secondweek updates they do an amazing job of keeping to their update schedule unlike most other ea devs fun theres alot of fun to be had in this game like me and my mate how we discovered the spodermin pylons all by happy mistakesnow comes the cons hackers ofc this was going to be one issue but eac and vac are seemingly unable to deal with the hackers that run rampant on some servers theres always going to be someone who is able to crack the security there is always a way in admin abuse another big issue i forgot to mention theres some servers that have 16yo teens who think they can tell people what to do on the server and kick whoever they want just because their iceberg base got raided you will actually be suprised at the lengths people go to heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off an admin it is very entertaining p sometimes gameruining updates i have only encountered one of these bugs during a server restart where the world would not save and wipe the map of all bases but this has been since resolved a few months ago would i recommend this postapoccalyptic manhunt with explosives i fuk yes i would 1010 ign 88 while i finger my prostate"

The_Community,"what can i say counter strike has always been an excellent shooter and cs go is arguably the pinnacle of the series the addition of ranked competitive matches are essential to the experience in cs go with other modes being generally less impressive than straight forward public servers seen in previous titles cheating is more prevalent than ever within ranked matches leading to many disappointing experiences especially within the higher ranked matchesthe monetisation of skins is purely optional and while a total waste of money it is reasonably unobtrusive if that is not something you are into the addition of wagering on professional matches in the game probably warrants an ethical discussion especially for younger playersthe dlc packs are generally not worth a purchase as they are now no longer required to play the maps and only offer additional achievements and vanity items having said that the quality of these dlc maps overall can be a mixed bag but regular content updates are always great to seei probably wouldnt suggest this title to younger players as the monetisation options can not be disabled The_Community is generally quite abusive and the amount of cheaters may lead to more frustration than fun for committed but less mature playershaving said that this is probably one of the best competitive first person shooters ever made there are quite literally hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay here due to the depth offered in both skill and strategy unfortunately much like in many other competitive online games it is The_Community that lets the game down the most with rampant cheating and generally unpleasant people being never too hard to run intoi would recommend this game to any shooter fan but its certainly not for the faint hearted expect to get seriously beat up on if you are coming in cold"
The_Community,"despite the low server population and steep learning curve this is one of the most underrated and rewardingly deep first person shooters ever made it has a genuinely unique premise excellent graphics is well optimised and stable and boasts an impressive depth of both skill and strategy to the gameplay if not for the dwindling population and high likleyhood of getting utterly detroyed by veteran players i would totally recommend that every fps fan play thisThe_Community is somewhere between welcoming and scornful and while newbies may be welcome in some corners this is a game where you should expect to get totally and utterly destroyed by series veteransthis will forever be one of the most underated games ever made"

The_Community,"stardew valley is a heartwarming game you may pass this up in your queue as another boring indie game with pixelart graphics but if you look closer youll find a beautiful game masterfully created by a single person with great graphics an intriguing plot and a real sense of community if youre anything like me youll get lost within the game within your first hour many draw comparisons with harvest moon and i definitely agree but as many see it as a reimagining i see it as a spiritual successor building upon the farming and marriage aspects of the game and adding things like events community fishing mining combat foraging and The_Community centrethe few things that bring the game down are its audio bugs very few gamepad support using a keyboard and mouse is much better shallow combat scheme could be built upon and pixel sizings not matching sometimes which never fails to look like a beautiful meadow with dead cows in it by this i mean when watching tv and several inventory items but all these are tiny nitpicks compared to the full gamei would definitely reccomend stardew valley in fact its my independent game of the year so far and one of my favourite games of all time and its made by one personalso its a pretty cool game to 100 achievements are fair and not too timeconsuming and its an overall fun game and The_Community centre thing is one of the best things to 100 this year in my opinionfinal rating 9110"

The_Community,"this game had plenty of potential when i bought it in early acess over a year ago the company is known for creating very substandard games the monstrosoty starforge was a very big cash grab for their audience never the less we gave them a chance after a year of development the game is still extremley similiar with barely anything added the game is ruined by bugs and hackers and the developers dont listen to The_Community i will never purchase anyother codehatch game again ive put many hours into this game and i cant believe ive wasted so much time on such tripe if you want to waste time in anger then go ahead and play it"

The_Community,"dayz standalone after roughly playing this game for 20 hours i have enjoyed it so far although my review is going to be washed down by all the negetives i just want get my review out there dayz standalone has been in early access for about 3 years and some people just dont read the note displayed on the dayz standalone steam page warning this game is early access alpha please do not purchase it unless you want to actively support development of the game and are prepared to handle with serious issues and possible interruptions of game as a short answer i would say dont buy the game until its fully out or in beta unless you want to face countless glitches such as zombies running trough walls and triple hitting in dayz zombies are the least of your worries you can play as a legendery hero or a bandit i have been held as hostage 3 times already you can also play a role playing version of dayz i havent touched dayzrp but you can play it here httpwwdayzrpcom prosrealistic unlike some other zombiesurvival gamesreally big map that takes alot of your time and does not keep you boardbalanced weaponsthats really it i cant remember anything else 3 cons really hard to meet new people as they might kill you or hold you hostagereally hard to find ammunition because all millitary basespolice stations are lootedeverywhere is looted if you play on a server with heaps of people conclusion anyone who says dayz standalone is dead or that the developers have taken the money and ran or that The_Community is dead quite frankly is full of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit the game is very much alive and so much better than it was when it started even though dayz sa has been slow off the start compared to other survivalist games h1z1 rust ark unturned miscreated etc i strongly believe it will come out on top as the best survivalist game when it is finished no other survival game has this much attention to detail and realism as dayz no other survival game has the kind of studio resources and money that bohemia has to put out a strong title no other survival game has mastered the hardcore aspect of survival and struggle better than dayz almost every other survival game was rushed out on a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit unreal engine in an effort to reap money off the survivalist scene and try to outbeat bohemia to the punch on features and gameplay games like rust and h1z1 fail to hit the bullseye on what a survival game should be dayz standalone does this right and does it good i would definitely recommend this game now as its about to surpass the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit outta all other games on the market go out there and start surviving but be warned of the glitches thanks for reading i also might make a fps boost guide for dayz edit i made a dayz fps boost guide httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid675608086"

Evolve,"innovation is almost always a good thing especially in the relatively saturated and homogeneous survival genre procedurally generated postapocalyptic worlds need wood get wood build blockbased houses form groups with other human players to survive these are elements that are as overused as the faded tighty whities that i continue to wear to date and who can forget the zombiesits always another bloody ugly zombieand that is why the long dark feels like a drop of pristine water on a wretched pair of lips its artstyle is bold and deliciously refreshing in a game that is intended to simulate survival in the harsh conditions of the northern canadian wilderness its roguelike elements such as permanent death and a finite amount of loot in the world shifts the players focus from spending hours upon hours developing a character and his or her humble abode to spending hours upon hours replaying just to beat a previous personal best in terms of the number of ingame days survived and instead of surviving against zombies players in the long dark are tasked to survive against mother nature which manifests in the form of biting windchills and harrowing blizzards as well as the wolf denizens that perpetually roam the snowy terrains the sound design of the long dark is also extremely well done everything from the crunch of your soles on snow to the groaning and creaking of wooden floorboards as you scavenge a log cabin for muchneeded supplies to the resounding bellow of your hunting rifle as you fire it at a menacing wolf sounds engaging immersive and realisticyes realism is the long darks home address being caught outside while there is a windchill can be devastating but hiding behind rocks sitting in the path of the direction of the wind can provide temporary relief to slow down the onset of freezing the games hunger system is also caloric based foods that you may loot from the environment have calories similar to their reallife counterparts albeit scaled up slightly since all activities including sleeping and standing still burns calories in order to survive your character has to consume a certain amount of calories each day in addition he or she also has to drink at least 22litres of water a day to prevent being dehydrated on the other hand innovation can be a twofaced heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit if taken too far it can detract immensely from a games production values and amount to a gigantic waste of a developers time reinventing a triedandtested wheel or removing core gameplay elements of a particular genre for no apparent logical or worthwhile purpose are typical examples of taking innovation one step too far as much as the long dark is a unique game that stands well apart from the rest in the survival genre hinterland studio has adopted a couple of gameplay design choices that are difficult to comprehend and for lack of a better word paradoxicalthe biggest culprit lies in the long darks surprising lack of player interaction with the environment besides interacting with the games various containers that exist in the form of drawers lockers cupboards stoves starting a fire and the occasional shooting of a wolf or deer there is little else that the player can do to change or manipulate the environment necessary activities such as the cooking of food harvesting of meat from an animals carcass or the boiling of snow to make potable water are reduced to dull and meaningless loading bars that signal the progression of an activity there is no farming there is no fortifying of a prefabricated house to better ward off the cold or wolves i could think of a hundred more things that a player as a survivor in an icy wilderness would be expected to do to survive better sadly players in the long dark are robbed of those options because the game limits the ways in which they can interact meaningfully with their environment why this should be so in a survival game is bewildering it metamorphoses an otherwise openworld survival game one that should be a suitable platform for the inception of personal survival stories whether heroic or tragic into a linear game of repetitive choicesthis is not to say that the long dark is bereft of playermade choices in spite of the games limited playerenvironment interactivity players still have a good amount of decisions to make that dictates how well or how long they will survive in the long dark for example constantly traveling in the open when there is a strong windchill will result in your character burning more calories as he or she freezes thus requiring you to expend more of your limited food supply each day restoring those lost calories similarly being greedy and attempting to carry all of the loot scavenged from your most recent exploration trip will also result in more calories burnt as your character shoulders the heavier load making a second trip on another day to carry the remaining supplies back to your stronghold may be a better strategy finding a way to make the most out of your limited supplies is an obsession that will occupy players especially the compulsive ones for many hours on endnonetheless the negative effects on the games longevity as a result of its decision to eschew player interactivity in favor of simplicity and ease of uptake are manifest despite the long dark currently sporting 3 different maps for players to explore in sandbox mode the relative constrained size of each map and the finite number of prefabs for players to loot means that each map can support at most 45 hours of proper gameplay beyond that the game starts to dEvolve into a tiresome cycle of hunting for deer or wolf foraging for wood cooking meat and boiling water to sustain your characters physical needs and resting in bed there is nothing else to do you can not build you can not farm all there is left to do is to wait for the inevitable end a most unfitting conclusion to a game with so much potentialat its current sale price of usd199 on steam the long dark is barely worth a buy my suggestion is to wait for a sale before spending some of your hardearned money on this game the long dark will most certainly become a better game with time on the other hand you are also unlikely to regret if you choose to invest in this game now it is one of the most polished and interesting earlyaccess survival game that is currently available on the market and if you enjoy a roguelike survival game that challenges you to do better in each successive game that you initiate the long dark is capable of providing an almost endless number of hours of enjoyment i am therefore giving the long dark the thumbs up"
The_Community,"i personally love this game its so fun and intense every match does feel like im in a horror film and i fckin love ityes there are bugs with matchmaking there are some things that still need to be ironed out but at its core it works and its fun this is a very great start and the developers are clearly driven to keep updating and improving the game theyre very involved with The_Community and they have weekly twitch streams which i highly reccomend checking out i personally would urge anyone to buy it i get if its not everyones cup of tea but its a fun fastpaced game"

Portal,"if there are people like me out there who just werent satisfied for long enough with the Portal 2 coop mode then this is the modification for you this mod had me thinking really hard from level 1 and at level 4 i even brought out a notepad to work out the positions of my players this game starts at the end of the Portal 2 campaign and helps give some fanmade closure on the Portal series as did Portal prelude with the beginning of the series all in all this is a game i would certainly buy if the bugs were patched"
Portal,"it is the best Portal game yet"
Team_Fortress_2,"ive been waiting to have at least a month of playtime to write a review but since day one you have pretty much everything you could expect from a game of this genre topped im not a veteran of this kind of game by any means only played diablo 1 and not even a fan with this game its a complete different story everything that went wrong with diablo 1 that i can call out myself and diablo 2 3 by others as its a constant comparison with the now exking of the genre is made right in path of exile its even considered by some its rightful successor what was expected from the latest diablo title and just came out short as Team_Fortress_2 draws people from many likings into a firstperson shooter poe has players who are not even that into rpgs but theres something that lures them in the lore the scenery the loot system something aside from the latency drawback its a game that has much to give to the hardcore players as to the casual ones its made by an indie company that actively hears their player base and deploys frequent content updates and fixes still not enough reasons to try it out its free to play damn it"
Tf2,"hi guys on m personal opinion Tf2 is one of the best games on steam for free i tottally recomend it and love it so much if your new to the game i can gelp you out just join my group at this link httpsteamcommunitycomgroupsofficialbrownyif you need i can teach you how to play but youll learn fast you also can play in 2 mods mvm and pvp mvm is when you hae a team of six and you vs robots but it costs money to play pvp is onlne servers so player vs player you can trade and sell anything pretty much and do heeps thx i recomend this game Tf2 i give it a 910"

Tf2,"at first glance hawken may seem like a fastpaced easy to play balanced game you are wrongfirst i would like to point out some issues with this gamea instead of using your own steam account to play you must make a different account which has caused me and others to wait for long periods of time just to wait for the nonsteam account to sync with the serversb the main menu of hawken is very confusing to most new players because it is filled with lots of advertisments to buy these special packs which is preposterous in my opinionc your starting mech looks like a friggin tv with thin limbs and legs and to customize it and other mechs you must buy some camos and decals with real money the only other way you could customize it is to change the frame of your mechand all it does is add 001 more colour to itd the primary guns in the game have almost identical statsas of 31914 which make you waste your hardearned rewards on things that are almost the same as your stock weapone for those gamers whove played fastpaced games such as loadout Tf2 and call of duty i would like to say that no matter what mech that you play as you will be slow and it is hard to tell if you actually damaged an enemy or notf the hud that you will be using in the game will make you feel like youre actually inside a mech which is actually nice but if you move or walk the interface will shake in what direction youre going therefore making you dizzy andor distracted by itg in the matchmaking of this game no matter what level you are you could fight anyone so what im saying is that you could be level 15 but you will fight people whove tested the alpha version of this game a long time ago and theyll show no mercyoverall this game has potential but i honestly think that the devs need to work on almost everything to make this game more appealing to gamers who have played countless fastpaced shooters"
Css,"i plan to write a decent rendition of why i think this is the best 4x game i have played however for now i will just say thisnothing gives you more of an adrenaline rush than playing a long ironman game and having to fight a massive multiparticipant battle over your own homeworld as it is bombed by xenos hell bent on your annihilation with your fleets lacking a tech edge or numbers try not to shed a tear for your little virtual peeps as they migrate make friends do science and fight to the death all under your direction will you be a happy little camper in your own little corner of the galaxy or will you risk it all to bring all empires into the fold of you obviously better empirei found earth destroyed by nuclear warfare i uplifted cockroaches and allowed them to own an entire sector after a grueling war they saved my economy due to their immense help and the help of my other alien races within the uCss i gave all alien citizens the right to vote and run for any officeseveral years later a cockroach general was on the ground when i defeated the armies on two of my long time rival homeworldsnellpaxo and its many allies started the war with me because the uCss was making their hippy vibes feel bad not even kidding they are space bug ghandi from civ 3 wars with there alliance one loss the uCss had to give up multiple worlds one white peace we destroyed much of each others fleets and finally victory never give up never surrender and fightif you havent bought this and you like being immersed in games i highly highly recommend you buy thistldr i press f to pay respects to the 1st chosen fleet that saved my homeworld and was wiped out as it lured away several empires worth of enemy fleets"

Dota_2,"as incredibly popular as it is the game mechanics seem to be very much rendered to appeal to those already experts in the genre these finite and interesting mechanics seem to tease new players of low skill level another detterent for new players is the immediate unlock of all heroes this means that in order to find ones favorite hero players have to play through dozens of matches with new strategies and skills as a preference i would reccomend league of legends over Dota_2 for players new to the moba genre simply because of its more accessible interface and more newb friendly system"
Terraria,"Terraria is a fun and easy to learn game it involves key building elements similar to minecraft but also includes great exploration and customization this game is a great game and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable different game"
Super_Meat_Boy,"from the creators of Super_Meat_Boy the binding of isaac is one of the most interesting and unique indie games on the market every play through is a blast and you will never have the same run twice as there are randomly generated rooms and floors to explore however in some aspects the games enjoyment is withered and incredibly frustrating within the first 1020 hours of gameplay and as a result you will die alotone of the finest elements that refine the game is its randomly generated level this gives the player loads of replayability and intrigue in what might happen next time i play with these randomly generated levels the designers also placed over 20 bosses that get more and more challenging as you progress and strategies may need to be employed to bring them down but it doesnt stop there there are close to 100 items that you can collect which alters the game mechanics and even your characters appearance and thats not even including dlc with every game there are the negatives and we must discuss them so whats wrong with this game well the first 1020 hours will kick you in the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit you will die many many times and if you dont learn from these mistakes and adapt to an enemies fighting capability you will keep getting your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kicked also be prepared to open up a wiki because when you pickup an item for the first time there is no telling what it will initially do however if you can manage to have the patience to get over that first 1020 hour hurdle then the game will be a blasttoo long didnt read let me summarise positives randomly generated levels no two runs will be the same tons of unique bosses items and enemies also mini bosses comedic tone and references throughout game negativesalmost sadistic first 1020 hoursno item descriptions blandly tells you item functions wtfalmost unplayable without consulting the wikithis game is undoughtably fun dont let those negatives throw you off this game deserves to be played i payed 10 for this game and ive probably milked about 5 times its value out of it for 5 on steam 3 dlc that you should only buy once youve completed the game several times this game is a bargain and deserves your utmost attention910"
Tf2,"this game is just great it has the one thing most fps games lack that one thing is community made game modesmaps ect the fact you can get the game fans and followers to create items to be put in the game is amazing it also brings a lot of diversity to Tf2 and i love playing something new everyday810"
The_Community,"this game is a very fun game although very untidy it is a ton of fun and a barrel of laughs there is a warning upon startup of the game that tells you that the game is a work in progress so you can not really complain about all the bugs and problems it has but regardless of its errors that will tick you off sometimes it is still really really fun sometimes challenging sometimes easy it really depends on the server the time you play and where you spawn the only thing that really grinds my gears is The_Community most people will just shoot you before they ask you your name so unfortunately its shoot first or die sometimes you get the good person that is willing to help you out like myself but most people are pretty merciless also some bambis fresh spawns will pose to be of good heart but the minute you put a weapon in their hands you better be ready to quickly draw your weapon so that is the only big big problem that might not able to be fixed but i definitely do recommend this game"
Csgo,"walking down a beach and seeing a light house walking up to it and looking up to see the massive scale of this light house scale thats what makes this game so enjoyable is the scale as i found this rock pool and i look up and see the georgeous blue sky with these rocks around it just looks so dam good now beware this is a walking sim but that doesnt make it bad as when i get home i like to relax so its nice to come home to a plesant view and yes i am using vr but it isnt the htc vive or the oculus rift insted it is my samsung galaxy s7 and the viewmaster vr getting samsung gear vr i am also using an app call trinus vr now i can hapily say that this game is great to calm down and its only 099c so you know sell a Csgo skin or a steam card to get this game"
Metro_2033,"a very short summaryMetro_2033 is a postapocalytpic firstpersonshooter videogame based on the novel written by dmity glukhovsky the story follows a young man named artyom as he travels through the dark and dangerous tunnels of the moscow metro while fighting for his life against mutants and banditswhether it is the darkness of the tight tunnels or the open space of the destroyed surface above i simply love the atmosphere i mean its similar to every other postapocalyptic game that ive played but this one just seems different somehow plus tiny features such as cracks on the gas mask and the heavy breathing of the protagonist makes it even better in my opinion the only downsides of the videogame is the voiceacting im assuming that they were trying to steer away from the stereotypical russian accent or its just me and my knowledge of russian accents but lets just ignore that the framerate isnt the best either there are times when it would dramatically drop then randomly rise again i dont know about everyone else but then again maybe its just meall in all i think its an excellent game and to conclude this short review i give it a 455"

Men_Of_War,"this is my previous review when i hated the game you can read it but my new review is after the belowi thought it was an extremely fun game i loved the dday mission in campaign and even without the expansions it is an excellent gameuntil i went on the game one time and found that all units and bases were invisible i tried everything and even looked solutions up on youtube but to no avail sadly this game was a waste of my money and it is now unplayable because the enemies are invisible and it just ruins the once amazing company of heroes i am now sort of hesitating to buy coh 2 becuase it could happen with that game too and coh 2 is 50 so sadly this game was a waste of time and money and unless it gets fixed i wont and cant play the game again but to wrap up on a good note i had plenty about 4 matches of good times and it is an older game so i cant expect too much cya and hope the the gods it gets fixed editso i reinstalled the game after deleting it and i happily found out that it didnt turn my men invisible i replayed the 1st campaign 1st level but on the second level all my men and enemy men were in tpose with their guns sticking out of there chests and to make it worst everythng but the ground was black not bien racist i couldnt see my objectives becuase a huge black wall would appear in front of it and it is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit i will uninstall this game forever and go play Men_Of_War assault squad a real strategy game mowas is soo much better than ths junk and in mowas there is an editor though complicated this game is stupid and i will never waste money on sequels ore anything even if it is on sale screw this gameeditsorry i raged quite a bit when i wrote the review now 2 years after uninstalling i downloaded it again the new steam version and it worked perfect i have played heaps already and i am soo happy my favourite strategy game is back in action thankyou whoever changed the game u r the best1010perfect"

The_Community,"at first i was not 100 sure about buying or passing mostly owing to the simple art style and the fact its a tower defense which are a dime a dozen now days however after looking at reviews and seeing some high praise and checking the forms and seeing active devs interacting with The_Community decided to give it a trythe first thing i met was a user agreement which is fairly common now days however unlike others i actually read it was very simple and easy to understand made a nice impression and told me about their attention to detail before even accessing the first screen of the game this attention to detail was further proven once within the game the customization in just the options menu alone warrants this game being noticeable i cant say if you will find it worth your money but if you have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket or see this on sale well worth full price in my opinion grab itthis game and its developers are like a unicorn in this day and age they clearly care about their players and the product itself will be keeping a eye out for future releases from themif you have any doubts look at a few of the stickied threads to see the developers love for The_Community and the game and notice that to date there are 377 positive reveiws and only two negative p"
The_Community,"im sorta torn on my opinions of this game while gameplay is definitely fastpaced and fun some game mechanics are a little broken imo for example some of the duelwielding smgs can three shot you in the knee and still kill you while some of the assault rifles take 45 shots through the chest also some players who have played the game and the series for a long time will have better perks and weapons so they can just get a few easy kills get a massively overpowered killstreak reward and dominate the entire game The_Community could also use a little dusting up visuals are nice and run smoothly on old pcs and games can be fun if played with the right people of similar skill level price tag is very overpriced imo for a game thats two years old and already has had 2 sequels released in the period"

The_Community,"i remember seeing this game around a year ago lets say it was good then but its even better now maybe not everyone likes this game but the amount of detail put into this game is just amazingthe game is about running a prison and it sticks by it your prison is in your hands but my favorite part is that its not fully in your control sure you can assign patrols and use non lethal but very effective tools to placify an inmate but even with that you will always get terrified if one prisoner starts rioting and they take out a weapon the guards can fight them but they attack other inmates then its the matter of getting a guard asap to the area or risk a life or 2 and recently when the ability to fail was added suddenly you couldnt let the inmates escape or let a riot go on for too long which made it more intense when a riot broke outthe developers themselves are probably the most best ive ever seen they never get off track with other ideas as explained in one of their videos but they take ideas from all the players and get The_Community and are now working to wipe most of the bugs out of the gameas mentioned before not every person may like this game partly because of the amount of patience needed but i dont care in my opinion also the freedom of the modding community is perfectthis game takes the idea of running a prison and strategy and mashes it up into one game would i reccomend it of course i have put hours not only building my own prison but downloading others huge riots fires and a prison built for 16 must quickly be adjusted for 45you dont have to but to sum all of this up in 3 words they would be buy this game"

Tf2,"fun and addictive is all i have to say its a fast pace firstpersonshooter with multiple styles of play quake live has straight the getgo been a completly fun blast and the basic premis of the controls are if you play any other fps your a pro the most important thing for me is im a rocket jumping maniac in Tf2 and where did rocket jumping start quake so that means that im a rocket jumping maniac in quake live literaly any one who picks this game up and practices offline for half an hour can play half decent i recomend this game for fps lovers"
Tf2,"an excellent game combining the foundations of the classic moba genre with the frantic fastpaced shooting of Tf2 would definitely recommend"
Tf2,"this game is absolutely amazing if youre a hardened fps veteran or even a newbie you will definitely enjoy this gamefirst off i have never played any quake or unreal games so im very new to the fps subgenre that ratz occupies so this game was completely new to me but boy what a breath of fresh air it wasfirstly the graphics never have i seen a game with such simple but at the same time elegant graphics having such simplistic graphics not only makes the game look nice and modern it also helps you spot the enemy rats that could be lurking around the corner just waiting to shoot yousecondly the level of customisation in this game is astounding you can customise your fov so you can either be like a quake pro or have a call of dutyesque fov like me but thats not all you can also customise your laser colour type enemy colour gibs crosshair and team colour you can also disable the ingame music so you can add your own heartpumping music to suit your playstylealso the gunplay is very barebones but at the same time very fun and enjoyable everyone gets the same beamshooter gun which means that no one is every at an advantage over another player and therefore who gets the kills is determined purely by player skill rather than a weapon advantage also if youre familiar with Tf2 or other games where shooting rockets at your own feet is beneficial youll love this game the beam jumping in this game is so fluid even at a high ping that youll be impressed by the mobility you can achieve with your beamshooter with the jumping you can constantly strafe around the map but you can also reach strategic map positions that can help you gain an advantage over your enemiesthe maps in this game all have their own unique style and ive also noticed that they all seem to have a different colour palette for example one map may be predominantly green coloured while another could have mostly red tones all maps which ive played seem to have a good balance between stratergy and fun although some maps are definitely more enjoyable than others in the end no matter what map is chosen you should have a blast playingfinally the gamemodes due to a lack of players ive only been able to play deathmatch so far which is enjoyable even in its own right the other gamemodes are classic staples you have duel capture the flag and survival i cant really talk about these modes since ive never played them but according to other people they are great fun to playoverall this is an excellentlymade game that excels in all aspects of its design from the gunplay to the customisation you should have an excellent time playing ratz"

Csgo,"what ever you do dont get this game if you have seen the trailer its fake they got a pro player playing it maybe even a developer the hitboxes are a a massive lie go get Csgo instead heaps better gamebrowsing the steam store looking for a good gamei stumbled across a game call warmode i take a look at it downloaded it because it only took 5 minsi ask lord gaben if this game comes in good he only said sorry this game only comes in cant launch game without crashing 300 ping on every server mainly because i live in australia cant access the main menu cant access the options or faulty hitboxesso basically the game comes in bad or really bad rightyeah pretty much go play Csgo instead of this filth"
Tf2,"i want to play in austrialia but im forced to connect to na servers which give me 170something pingthey should make anyone can make any weapon for free because now its just discouraging for people who have just started imagine if csgo or Tf2 required you to upgrade your awp to make it a dakdak or have a rocketlauncher that did far more damage than any other because you had played the game longerontop of the fact that a fully upgraded sniper rifle takes ages to kill and is super heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit but that kinda makes my main point irrelevantwhateverthis game is free so its not like your gunna have to make some sort of investment but i wouldnt reccommend410"

Starbound,"so far i have only played 36 hours of Starbound and i would certainly recommend this gameproshas quite a lot of features considering it is an early access game that might be because it is nearly out of early accessome people might think i am talking rubbish here has very little bugshas a very detailed character creation giving you the ability to customise your character to your likesmusic is also very nicethe interface is very easy to used to and after a while feels naturalto expand on reason 1 you can upgrade your ship mater manipulator basically starter mining tool that can mine everything but slowly every race a little back story to it you can get special abilitiescons some quests are a bit ridiculous eg for one quest i travelled at least 3 solar systems trying to find a floran villageto sum it up i think it is a pretty polished up game and it has a lot of content and will sell well"

Csgo,"really enjoying this title as a late adopter to Csgo im enjoying every moment its fast paced and rewarding my only hang up is the hackers even in comp mode you will find them sucessfully aced a team 2 times in 3 rounds 2 players on enemy team decide to toggle on in a competitive match turning the score card on its head and taking the game apart from that top shelf stuff"
Portal,"this game projects a similar atmosphere to that of Portal 2 puzzles both simple and complex a very institutionlike environment and an almost complete lack of storyline or context that leaves you wondering at the very end wait whata brilliant game that is well worth the money"
Portal,"ignore everything you see and hear while playing this game because your senses will lie to you countless times i believe polygon nailed it when they labelled it a mobius tripa brilliant game full of simple yet complex tricks and puzzles that challenge you at every corner while instilling upon you a deep and meaningful rhetorici would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the puzzles present in the Portal games"

Evolve,"i really enjoyed dead by daylight when i could get a game they basically took the concept of Evolve but did it much better the only problem i have with it is that it takes forever to get a game because it only searches for a couple of seconds and if it doesnt find a game it says no matches found and you have to click search again which can get really annoying if they fixed the searching i would say it is one of my favourite games but i just get bored of waiting to find a game and its not like you can go watch youtube or anything cause you have to click search every 5 seconds"
Evolve,"the game has very nice graphics that could be improved on as well nice smooth controls when skulking around pun intended as you dont have to constantly hold down ctrl like in avp although you do find yourself stuck on little objects a fair bit and it is a challenge to sometimes get on the roof of a room however im not saying that is a good idea as you will have trouble getting to your enemy before you get shot making it sometimes difficult to get away although due to the small objects that are included you cant easily blend with the wall you can however easily use the small pieces to do nice leaps from wall to wall to accelerate youthat was only talking about the graphics and skulk though as the aliens or karah you can Evolve into different types flying slashing tank and the cute support allowing you to also Evolve to the new types each set with separate abilitiesthe marines look like they have it tough but in fact they do not as the marines being equip with an arsenal of ranged weapons along with jetpacks allow them to dodge attacks and kill something before it get to themusuallyit may seem that the game has a variation of 2 gametypes to play fast and abusive or slow and stealthy but there is also a third variation the commander without the comm commander you will be screwed and without a good comm you will also be screwed as a comm on either team are required to be able to place support structures and upgrade you this means that if you are more of a good strategy top down player then you dont have to go looking for another game honestly its like 2 games in onetheres one major floor with some of the levels though some are too wide this makes it nearly impossible for the karah to win there are some rooms where the moment the marines capture it the karah arent able to even enter the room as they are to wide open there is also glitches in the maps that stop the comm from placing connection nodes called cysts these cysts are the karahs way of transferring energy where you are meant to be able to an annoyance is that sometimes you will get base rushed and thats the end of the gameno joke once your base is attacked within the first 15 minutes you are placed in a permanent disadvantage this problem is in many games though and can not be solved by devs so nearly every player on this game has a mutual understanding not to egbr early game base rush so it is currently quite rare to see a base rush within 15 minutes or so of a match startinganother major problem is the difficulty curve due to the fact that there is practically no training trying to understand how to play properly and learn how to dodge bullets is simply not possible the training in the game is mostly just a movement tutorial as the bots are veryunresponsive although there is a video tutorial which helps when trying to understand the games mechanicsin total ns2 is well balanced and if you stick with the game long enough it will end up being incredibly fun it only takes about 1 hour to fully understand the game well for me it didi almost forgot to mention the loading times take about 510 minutesgraphics extremely smooth controlsmultigenreteams are nothing like each otheracceleration physics used as mechanicoriginal character varietyproper stealth mechanicscharacter traits stay for only that character typemodding supportbias mapsmap glitchesegbr problemanti egbr community mostlydifficultylearning curve trainingpractice modehelpful tutorialbad bot ailoading timesscoring22 pros8 constotal 14 prosnnumber of conspros totalaanswer depends on cons majority or pros majority 01667na 50166714233457310"
The_Community,"the game alike its brethren endless space has stunning graphics however it is styled in 816 bit ie the game keeps style with the old bitlike games but does not look completely like an old cartridge game the game play is surprisingly smooth and easy to understand but the game gives quite the challenge regardless what character you have or how skilled you are every level and play through you will have to think strategically and place defences so you also have to keep a constant watch on your heros life as well make sure that your producers are all equal or close in production or focus mostly on one type as you traverse through the seeming less endless floors every item that you get holds a big value even if it is a stray jacketthere are a few glitches left in the game but all are being fixed quite constantly by a very active dev team which are probably the most friendly dev team you will ever come across and The_Community even friendlierthe music is done by flybyno the musician for the well known endless space has again created more masterpieces the music in this game is very well thought out as the music does not make you have to battle with it in order to think of strategies rather it helps you while setting the mood and vibe very well the calm music slow paced and thought inventiveness is what makes the entire game so relaxing most of the time yet so frantic at othersthe multiplayer however is still having difficulties but has only recently been released so is technically in beta still the multiplayer regardless of your upload speedsdownload speeds has a big lag problem which is getting much better slowly over time as it isnt amplitudes forte but they have worked with multiplayer on turn a based game beforeat first glance the game looks entirely turn based dote is part turn based part strategy and part real time the turn based comes from the doors and the material obtaining being that each turn is counted in doors the strategy is obvious planning where you will go and where certain things go along with the difficult choice of weather should i have all defence in here or make it a place for my heros to healor both will be asked about in every room that becomes available to you to place defences an the such there is more strategy in the characters as well as you will have to plan who gets what and who should have what role which becomes even larger and harder to do in multiplayer more on that later in fact you even have to plan your escape finally the real time comes down to doing all of the above whilst being attacked placing defences watching your health equipping items you name it you can do it in real time when the waves of monsters are outmultiplayer doesnt only have problems with lag or randomly disconnecting but also somewhat in communication and majorly in sharing items when there is an item no one knows what the chest holds so no one knows what the item is until they pick it up once the item is picked up instead of the item going into the global inventory it goes into the personal inventory which if you cant equip the said item for any reason you cant drop it nor trade it in any way this makes the game more difficult as loot gives more bonuses and traits than levelling meaning your entire team is more likely to die unless you all get luckynext problem is communication due to the lag building things and claiming a room becomes more difficult as more than one person may try buildingclaiming at once the only way around this currently is to let the host of the server to buildclaim meaning your entire team will depend on you if you are the hostall up the game is well balanced not pain numbingly boring even after a few plays and looks very good for its chosen stylegreat graphics design smooth controls very easily understandable simple tutorial awesomely challenging extremely well balanced multigenre active devs extremely friendly devs extremely friendly community perfect music multiplayer very laggydisconnecting multiplayer very interesting mechanics mutiplayer inventory problem muliplayer communication problem 34 pros8 constotal 28 prosnnumber of conspros totalaanswer depends on cons majority or pros majority 01667na 501667264334593349310if the mutiplayer was fully fixed and the tutoral a bit more advanced ie more interactive it would be a 1010"

Well_There,"this game starts off really well as the transition from the old 8bit era to the 3d part is pretty cool but this transition happens in a space of half an hour and the game turns for the worse after the game becomes 3d after that it becomes a bad zelda and final fantasy clonethe turnbased strategy is way too easy as your partner has a heal spell that is effective considering how little damage the enemies do she doesnt do a whole lot of damage except for xcrystal but the hero can do just as Well_There is no limit on how many times you can use her spell and it heals both characters at the moments when she isnt around you have enough money to buy a bunch of potions to last you until your partner comes back because of this the battles will get boring and mindnumming very quickly and youll start running from battles just to get past themthe actionadventure gameplay isnt as bad as some of the levels have intresting mechanics like shifting back and forth from 16bit to 3d but these sections dont last as long and they dont get repeated they shouldve stuck with these ideas as it couldve added more puzzles and ways to get around them instead it focuses more on the combat which is stiff to say the leastoverall it takes a lot of ideas some from other games and some entirely unique and sticks it all together instead of getting a few ideas and expanding upon thoses to make the game feel like an exploration through the actionadventure genre rather than a game that took ideas from other games in hope of it working well combined the fact that the game is really short and that its 10 this game isnt worth getting"

The_Community,"after the recent patch robocraft has become quite similar to a moba now while some of The_Community has disliked this i feel this will help it in the long run the new gameplay mode does take longer however it does provide new opportunities for interesting gameplay as well as becoming longer the devs have added a shield around the base that heals you and goes down after the opponents have control over all the newly added towersthese new game mechanics have really added to the strategy of the game no longer will your opponents rush at you trying to take your base early instead they will try to take towers as you fend them off and try to take towers of your ownone of my favorite moments in this game was when i was the last surviving member of my team and the enemy was attacking my base using the new shield to my advantage i and a large amount of drifting and strafing i was able to destroy the attackers and with the overclocking i had gained led a successful charge on the enemy base after we had taken all the towersoverall the game is very fun and i would recommend picking it up"

Tf2,"some people will look at this game for the first time and say something like just another zombie game or the occasional fanboy would yell cod black ops ripoff but this game is not something like that this game is not just a zombie game but an action adventure game too the characters you play as are very memorable and you will more than likely grow to like them by the end of their groups respective stories which brings me to happily say that the left 4 dead characters are back in this installment with their campaigns remade which could potentially bring a new feeling when playing those levels depending on how you look at it the new characters sport their own set of campaigns that are also extremely fun the amount of different weapons might be underwhelming if you are a big player of Tf2 or loadout but i think in this kind of game thats ok because we dont need heaps and heaps and heaps of weapons i also love how many different game modes there are in this game ranging from a versus mode where you play as the infected one round and the survivours the next realism when you play in a real apocolypsetype setting and the many many mutation modes which tweak the normal campaign gameplay the soundtrack i personnally dont think is too good but without a doubt the music mods on the workshop are just amazing this game comes with a fullyworking steam workshop that can range from hud mods all the way to changing the music of the jukeboxes this is without a doubt awesome and definately worth 1015 mins of searching through and going on a modbinge i can safely say that this is my favourite zombie game ive played ever"

Css,"gta v is the great masterpiece of rockstar that is like mona lisa to leonardo da vinci it was originally released on xbox 360 and ps3 in 2013 i will be honest here i got into the hype and preordered the game just because i knew that it would be the definitive sequel that gta iv needed so badly and the expectations did not fail short from the trailers i loved it all the story the driving draw distance shadows combat and the way the guns feel online wasnt great for me but at least i got compensated along with many others 500 from rockstar themselves as an apology for the issues in october overall it was amazing to say the least with my experience and it was well rendered on 8 year old hardwarenow here comes the remastered version for xbox one ps4 and eventually pc now i didnt buy gta v for the consoles because i knew the pc version would outclass the consoles themselves and i am happy to report that gta v runs well on my laptop dont ask the texture quality is superbly increased tenfold and makes the game livelier i got more immersed playing it on pc more than the last gen consoles but the nextgen would also show similar immersion results modding is also an advantage for pc players and you can now rest easy that rockstar wont ban you for modding in single player i modded the game to have the scripthook mod and radio stations on foot making the rampages more entertaining than the ingame music for the graphic obsessed tuners there are a ton of options to tweak them to your liking with many types of antialiasing such as fxaa msaa and nvidias txaa with shadows amd has chs while nvidia has pCss if you are confident in adding more beauty there is the advanced graphics option and boy does it punish your pc in performance a lot but the results are worth itbut wait there ' s one thing also that the pc version has that the consoles dont have support up to 4k definition more on 4k later the movie editor included is a crafty equipment for when you want to make many genres of television and movies or recreate your best moments and brag about in youtube or the social club personally i am really confused about how it works but i prefer modding mayhem to anything else first person mode which was present on the next gen consoles is still present on the pc version and adds an extra layer of immersion to top it off the animations and the extra detail such as floating garbage on run down streets and cockroaches on the floor in trevors trailer make it more realistic in detail than in thirdperson now about 4k you need a super sli or crossfire to manage up to 60 fps in performance wise but it pays off as it looks dropdead gorgeous to look also if you were an originally playing the game before on oldgen and you have a social account linked to you online account for xbox live or playstation network you get special perks such as a railgun hatchet dukeo death stallion murder mysteries for noir filters animal photography that unlock a new submarine dodo seaplane monkey mosaics that reward you with a gogo monkey blista and exclusive cars that can be won by racing in new muscle races now there are more variety of animals that can be found in the game and you can even play as them by finding peyote plants and chewing on them also there are two new radio stations one of them is the lab while the other one is selfradio now in order to get it working put your music in the documents under rockstar gamesgta vmusic and place them there it ' s a great update to the game rather than just simply making it nicer for the eyes unlike some other gameshowever not everything is perfect several areas of the map can drop the fps and the launch was a bit of a disaster as people reported that their usernames were causing gta v to not launch at all the download times were also painful when you launched the game after you finished you preload because there is a day one patch for the game that is mandatory and it took me almost an hour to launch the game because of the slow download speeds and the size of it next thing is i had to update my drivers because the fps were fluctuating and it annoyed me beyond irritation however this did not stop me from enjoying the game also you must have a social account because of the launcher requires it it will be mostly annoying but seeing as i already created one it didnt bother me much from a techincal povthe online heists make finally an appearance before and thats also the selling point for going back again other than the expanded amount of people that can go into a server up to 30 players not much has changedbut where does this lead to even if it had a few hiccups the pc version of gta v is definitely the definitive edition and i do appreciate the effort that rockstar did even though delaying it is frustrating the result is a pc game that you shouldnt definitely miss it towers over gta iv red dead redemption and max payne 3 in graphics capability i cant wait for rockstars next big aa projectoverall for me1010 for the pc version9510 for gameplay8510 for the story710 for online"

The_Community,"the alpha of h1z1 was off to a very rocky start the game was absolutely riddled with bugs rendering it almost unplayable and to make it worse we found out that while soe had said that the only buyable objects would be cosmetic we later found out that this was not the case every person on the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit server with a couple of bucks to spare was calling in an air drop giving them guns tools and food so that they would have a major advantage over the competition but luckily those days are far behind us thanks to one of the best alpha development teams i have ever experienced they listen to what everyone in The_Community says most bugs are fixed within a day of them being reported and the rest they choose to keep working on full bore until they are fixed and i must say thank god they fixed the air drops air drops are now easily able to be seen by whoever is in your corner of the map the range in which they are dropped is far greater meaning that as opposed to you buy an air drop and you get it you are instead having to compete with a barrage of other players for your prize and finally the drop rate of things like guns and other weapons in an air drop has been dramatically reduced so that they won ' t set you to far ahead of the competition this has all helped to turn the game into a far more playable and enjoyable alphaif you want to get an idea of what the game might be like then just picture this day z but made by a far greater team with superior skill and coding knowledge who will in turn choose to listen to what their players ask for and fix every bug that crops up this game is how day z should have been the forest could have been and rust will never bei must put this out there this game is the most fun that i have ever had in an alpha or even a beta for that matter and i am putting that down to the wonderful team of devs behind itthe animations though only in alpha are beautiful and fluid there is a smooth transaction between different actions and a polished look to them normally only seen in finished games the graphics while not that bad could definitely use some texture updates before the final release of the game as they are currently looking a few years behind schedule but that is only expected in an alpha and finally i must just put it out there to all you gaming bullet fans that this is currently the most polished and enjoyable alpha on the steam market and thanks to some beautiful optimization it is playable on most average systems but never fear if you are currently strapped for cash but wish you could still play the game it will be free to play to the general public upon final releaseone thing that i have currently forgotten to mention is the beautiful design of the games ai zombies are as dumb as they should be and not much of a problem alone but are attracted to things such as sound meaning if you fire a gun at the wrong moment you could have a pack of as large as fifty zombies hunting you down at once which can cause quite a problem the way they have designed and built this ai really impressed me they act exactly as you would imagine a zombie should dumb and only a problem in numbers and this ai design has carried over to other creatures found in the game world from skittish deers to ferocious wolves ready to attack anything in their sight and terrifying bears who once locked onto you are probably some of the most dangerous creatures in the gamethe combat in this game has been beautifully designed the actions are smooth and you are actually able to feel the power as you send a fist flying into a zombies head as they send a hand back flying towards you the weapons while in most cases rare are very powerful and will give you a huge advantage over the competition while items such as combat knives and machetes will give you the upper hand in close quarters combat a bullet from any of the guns can be absolutely devastating but remember that a gunshot can be heard miles away so be careful not to attract the horde or worse another human hungry for your bloodso have i enjoyed h1z1 in the two short weeks this game has been out it has come so very far from the buggy pay to win mess it once was to the beautifully polished and enjoyable alpha it is today i must say that it is hands down the most enjoyable alpha or even beta that i have ever played it has been twenty dollars well spent and all thanks to the amazing team of helpful and responsive devs creating it i would strongly advise any of you zombie or survival fans out there to give this work of art a try and all that i am left to say is that i can honestly not wait for the next big update and eventually the final release of the game soe you have really outdone yourself this timecheck out more reviews and previews at gamingbulletcom"

Tf2,"i loved this game however i can not recommend this game after the most recent update Tf2 was the game where you just jumped in and mucked around you looked up the servers you wanted to play on and jumped in and out at your leisure their latest update has killed aspects of the game that i lovedvalve removed all of their servers from the browser they had the best servers you could vote for the next map kick tossers and hackers now you are left with community servers there are some out there that are good but are prone to advertising plugins and admin abusehackers delight pray to gaben that you dont end up with a hacker in casual play in my last game the opposing team had a blatant hacker i dont call people out for hacking at a whim and even his own team acknowledged it however in the new casual mode there is no way to remove these players from the game you cant vote kick them off if you leave you get penalized for abandoning the game which is ludicrous who the hell thought this was a good idea you assume the recovery position suck your thumb and wait for the round to end then wait for the next vac ban wave and hope its sooncasual play randomness you cant choose what game type you want you can minimise the randomness by clicking a few buttons and then hope for the best if youre proficient at multiple maps then great if not there isnt a way to choose specific maps or guaranteed a game typeword is some of these things will be fixed doesnt seem likely theyll return the valve servers to the browser real shame that"
The_Community,"this game is every thing i was wishing for its flawless gameplay combined with not being hard to learn plus this game gets straight to the point which makes it a excellent choice for someone who likes to have fun instead of spending 10 minutes trying to figure out what everything does as of yet while im still learning the game in many ways i have not won a single 1 v 1 match and The_Community is rather small but they are friendly and easy to get along with apart from one guy who was raging over the fact i was using strategy in a strategy game if u get this game and cant find a player match bot matches are fun with a smart ai that makes you think your opponent is a human player although i recomend trying to get a friend to play this game with as the game is much more enjoyable with friend to play it with"

The_Community,"guns of icarus is a good game a mix between coop and pvp the game encourages you to bring friends along to play with you the game lets you take on roles to keep your airship in battle what makes guns of icarus so good in my opinion theres 7 airships to choose from each with their own weaknesses and strengths theres a wide variety of guns to choose from from gattling guns to flare guns to mines not many people in guns of icarus are toxic in my opinion that i have seen making it easier since The_Community is helpful and friendly especially if you have voice chat they will be very happy to helpthere isnt a lot of bad things in this game and a lot of it isnt really much of a big deal this game is not buggy so i really think its a good job1010"

The_Community,"note keep in mind the game must be paid for in order to play at the moment as it is in early access it will become free to play at around the end of the year also a lot of the negative reviews on the front page are complaining about issues that have been fixed or changed or complaining about features that are not in the game yetin my opinion this game has a lot of potential even though it is currently in early access it feels like it has enough replayibility to keep me going for hundreds of hours with the latest update now here are some of the pros and cons for the game in its current statesome pros pretty art design the way it is done gives the game a more toon feel to it alot more enemy diversity compared to dd1 the game is regularly updated with the latest patch adding loads of content in to the game the people who work on the game interact with The_Community and hold developer streams on twitch every friday according to the developers there wont be dlc map packs so The_Community wont be split the music in the game is good the towers have more personality as i would call it once it goes f2p it wont be p2w betsy and cute propellor cats if you do buy early access you get 30 worth of ingame currency to buy costumes witha few cons its in early access so you have to pay to be able to play it tavern is laggy and the game feels slightly unoptimized uber skill spheres cost waay too many wyvern tokens i call the tokens betsy bucks level cap that does not take long to reach level cap will be increased later on earlier maps become meaningless to play once you hit level 25 they are adding incursions soon for them to make them playable in late game again bug paradise no controller support yetnote most of the problems i have with the game a due to the game still being in development and a lot of the features are not in it yetfinal verdict while the game is unfinished and has its fair share of problems its fun which is what people really look for in games 810 in its current state"

The_Community,"this would have to be one of the best early access titles that i purchased being a big fan of the original installment when i heard about the second installment i was excited did this game manage to live up to the excitement yes definitely the only flaw currently that i have found is the lack of content but this game is in early access and more content will obviously be added from the as of 24042015 4 hours that i spent playing this game both solo and with friends i feel like this game has incredible promisethe goodvisuals this games visuals are stunning the graphics have received a very nice upgrade from this games predecessor without taking away from the style that the first game portrayedperformance this game has very good optimization i was able to run the game on medium to high on my low end pc and still manage a stable 60fps with only a few ocassional dropsgore the gore system got a massive overhaul which just makes it so much more satisfying to blow the heads off of zeds and watch it literally explode spraying everything in blood each zed has a huge amount of points of dismemberment so you can quite literally tear them limb for limbui the user interface got some heavy tweaking compared to the first game making everything more sleek and easy to access the vendor pod has a very nice interface as well with everything laid out infront of you without having to scroll down or acrossclasses although only 4 of the classes are available at this point in time the skillsclass perks feel rewarding for the effort you put in sdk the game has been noted to have the sdk and community creations implemented later on in development which is great as i found The_Community creations one of the best parts of the first gamehumour thats right the wonderful british banter from the first game makes a comeback better than ever i mean who doesnt love british people insulting zombies pdosh aww yis the dosh now has physics you can literally make piles of money grab it while its hot ladsthe badenemy grapple this could be considered as nitpicking but the new way that the zeds grab you is quite honestly a pain in the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit when encountered with large crowds it can be quite annoying being spun around every couple of seconds having to bash a zed away only to be grappled by another one and spun around i personally preferred the grappling from the first game where they just slow down your movement until you cant moveservers im giving the game credit with this one but im just going to list it here for the time being since i consider it a negative part at this point in time currently the servers that are available are almost all full with only a few with much higher latency being available all of the ones with great ping and empty are privated however this wouldnt be too much of a problem but as of this point in time the method for creating a dedicated server for the game is quite tedious also im not sure if this is a glitch but 90 of the time when a game is finished i am often sent back to the main menu screen even on my friends gameall in all if youre a fan of the original installment id highly recommend picking this up if youre a bit sceptical about purchasing games that are in early access id probably suggest giving this one a miss until the price drops for a sale as there currently isnt too much content if youve never played the first game in the franchise but youre interested in zombie survival games such as left 4 dead i recommend giving this game a try i can definitely see myself sinking more hours into this game as it develops"

Evolve,"sum up good expensive ios portplague inc is an ios game around the 5 mark or your regional equivalent in saying this a price mark up of 10 is not something that a lot of people may think kindly to but if you do enjoy death simulators or something that involves logical thinking with some dynamic game play pick it up for the 15 or wait for the sale the game involves evolving a plague many to choose from to eradicate the human race the gameplay is created from number crunching and strategic thinking towards the extinction of the human population graphic quality is not great in this title little is able for customisation but the requirements for the title to run are quite minimum this is an early access as stated before and buyer should beware of this many game states and even options are still under development and only those who want to be involved in the development and social process of the game should buy it pre full release features such as multiplayer and scenarios are not completely functioning there are two tiers of multiplayer in my opinion the first consists of leaderboards and the social network sharing the second tier consists of the incomplete multiplayer mode which can only speculate to be a completive mode that heads you against another player in realtime hopefully game play itself is identical to the ios predecessor you infect one country to begin with and mutateEvolve the plague to achieve total annihilation of the human race and ultimately winning the game at the end of the game scoring does occur which allows you a placement on the leaderboards for more information do check out my perception check video on this title httpwwyoutubecomwatchvtguhpx5ghqsfeatureyoutube"

Dota_2,"ok ive nearly played 800hrs of this sht game dont get itbut when you win its its great d if you dont mind the stress and heart problems this game comes bundled with and that it destroys friendships by all means download Dota_2 that being said the stratergy and teamwork you need to preform flawless kills and team ganks on the enemy team is not easy but when done correctly and played as a team this game is truly a gem you will never find a game like this that gives you the satisfaction that the choices you make can change the game in a matter of secondsps the game does have a tutorial to get you going but if your new to the moba scene take the time to learn watch guides becuase this game has quite a steep learning curve and quite a big selection of items to buy it can be overwhelming to the new player i recommend playing a few bot games before jumping into a match against other players"

plenty of aerial dog fighting and battlfield micro this game is casual player friendly with opportunities for the more competetive playeronly problems are if youre an aussie finding people to play with can be quite difficult lag is also an issue if you are an oceanic playerfeel free to add me in game and set me as your referrer shameless selfpromotion p my name is virusalpha and im one of the

like to use the best units best setup and best strategy however if youre skilled enough you can work around it can be staleslightly longer reviewadding on to the abovethe meta shifts a lot when big updates come and rapidly change after balance changes this is probably a good thing however the game can become borning when everyone adopts the meta there is a tremendous selection of pilots airmechs parts and units the problem is balance achiving perfect balance and harmony is far from near thier are hunderds of units to use but generally high tier players pick the same 810 why because those units are best theres tons of pilots but players tend to choose 3 because they are the best theres 9 airmech classes but professional mainly use 3 this is just one of my dissatisfactions of the game there are unitsmechsitems that completely outclass others which is sad balance is yet to be achived in this game which is forgiveable because its still in betathe games busienss model is fair or even great everything can be purchased for in game currency which is amazing a casual player can unlock plenty of items in 1 day you can unlock all units pilots and items for in game currency which is amazing this currency is called kudos the premium currency in this game is diamonds and the game gives you 500 to start with with thos amount you can buy whatever you please but you can not buy power you can earn diamonds through quests but these diamonds are locked until you make a purchase of anything in game and obtain silver vip or higher its an incentive for you to invest money in the game with the smallest purchase avaiable being 5usdgenerally diamonds are used to buy cosmetics to look fancy and ultra classy you can buy ultimate variants of units which are unbalanced and super overpowered but these can only be used in solo play player vs ai coop and custom games these units can not be used in regualr unranked or ranked pvp generally these items are for noobs p hence upon starting the game you receive a random ultimate unit in your inventory new players these days are very lucky you get free items and cosmetics as you play the game this is just a taste of what you get when you purchase diamonds its an incentive to purchase diamonds and if you do i suggest gettin the starter pack as it gives you best value for your money so try out this game if you havent already if you dont like it simply uninstallthis game has a drop system in this drop systems you can receive crates cosmtics pets consumale items stuff and rare unit alternatives which can not be purchased normally this drop system is fair and gives you cool stuff which you can sell on the player market if you wishthe market is acessable when you reach level 10 which isnt hard at all even for a casual player at this level you can purchase stuff on the market at level 50 you can sell stuff on the market all items on the market are sold for premium currency unfortunately reaching level 50 is gon na take a long time however after a purchase and obtaining silver vip the marketis instanly acessable and for use if you are not a vip after selling an item you only get 30 of the diamonds you sold your item for with the rest being locked so for instance if you sell a hat for 100 diamonds you only get 30 there is also an ingame tax of 15 so if you want to sell and earn 100 diamonds your item will be listed for 115 diamonds once sold you get you 100 diamondstheres loadouts in which you can customise evrything you need for a game you can choose up to 8 different types of units to put into your

Airmech,"review in shortairmech is an action rts game taht takes a twist on the genere of rts gaming this game is a mix of RIRE with a game like starcraft you control a characterhero that is your Airmech and there are creeps that spawn from your main base every so often you can build your own units to fight by your side from a vast selection of units gameplay is usually fast and intense with plenty of aerial dog fighting and battlfield micro this game is casual player friendly with opportunities for the more competetive playeronly problems are if youre an aussie finding people to play with can be quite difficult lag is also an issue if you are an oceanic playerfeel free to add me in game and set me as your referrer shameless selfpromotion p my name is virusalpha and im one of the few australian playerspros lots of customisation a crapton of customisation possible fair business model not pay to win casual player friendly intense gameplay frequent updates balance changes and bug fixescons not many oceanic players meta shifts frequently post updates which may or maynot be a good thing meta meta meta a lot of high tier players use the same tactic strategy and loadout people like to use the best units best setup and best strategy however if youre skilled enough you can work around it can be staleslightly longer reviewadding on to the abovethe meta shifts a lot when big updates come and rapidly change after balance changes this is probably a good thing however the game can become borning when everyone adopts the meta there is a tremendous selection of pilots Airmechs parts and units the problem is balance achiving perfect balance and harmony is far from near thier are hunderds of units to use but generally high tier players pick the same 810 why because those units are best theres tons of pilots but players tend to choose 3 because they are the best theres 9 Airmech classes but professional mainly use 3 this is just one of my dissatisfactions of the game there are unitsmechsitems that completely outclass others which is sad balance is yet to be achived in this game which is forgiveable because its still in betathe games busienss model is fair or even great everything can be purchased for in game currency which is amazing a casual player can unlock plenty of items in 1 day you can unlock all units pilots and items for in game currency which is amazing this currency is called kudos the premium currency in this game is diamonds and the game gives you 500 to start with with thos amount you can buy whatever you please but you can not buy power you can earn diamonds through quests but these diamonds are locked until you make a purchase of anything in game and obtain silver vip or higher its an incentive for you to invest money in the game with the smallest purchase avaiable being 5usdgenerally diamonds are used to buy cosmetics to look fancy and ultra classy you can buy ultimate variants of units which are unbalanced and super overpowered but these can only be used in solo play player vs ai coop and custom games these units can not be used in regualr unranked or ranked pvp generally these items are for noobs p hence upon starting the game you receive a random ultimate unit in your inventory new players these days are very lucky you get free items and cosmetics as you play the game this is just a taste of what you get when you purchase diamonds its an incentive to purchase diamonds and if you do i suggest gettin the starter pack as it gives you best value for your money so try out this game if you havent already if you dont like it simply uninstallthis game has a drop system in this drop systems you can receive crates cosmtics pets consumale items stuff and rare unit alternatives which can not be purchased normally this drop system is fair and gives you cool stuff which you can sell on the player market if you wishthe market is acessable when you reach level 10 which isnt hard at all even for a casual player at this level you can purchase stuff on the market at level 50 you can sell stuff on the market all items on the market are sold for premium currency unfortunately reaching level 50 is gon na take a long time however after a purchase and obtaining silver vip the marketis instanly acessable and for use if you are not a vip after selling an item you only get 30 of the diamonds you sold your item for with the rest being locked so for instance if you sell a hat for 100 diamonds you only get 30 there is also an ingame tax of 15 so if you want to sell and earn 100 diamonds your item will be listed for 115 diamonds once sold you get you 100 diamondstheres loadouts in which you can customise evrything you need for a game you can choose up to 8 different types of units to put into your loadout there are infantry light vechicles trucks tanks big tanks even bigger tanks artillery healing radar units traps turrets and socket units that provide speical effects you have a 9th slot for a guardian that provides unquie effects such as healing radar and for extra damage out put in your loadout you can customise your Airmech you can change Airmechs customise its parts change cosmetics and a whole lot of other stuff you have a slot for an item which provide small buffs finally there is a space for your pilot which is very important as pilots usually depeict your play stylethe game has a crafting system which lets you craft a wide range of items but is restricted on current items you habe and your levelin terms of gameplay you will always be using your Airmech to carry your units across the map you can pick your units up and micro them there are mass commands for macroing tanks are the main unit composition with support units such as healing and radarartillery jamming there are many ways to play this game this game features outposts once captured they provide different effects and raise your upkeep yes you have upkeep you use hot keys to build units and collect them from eitehr your fortress or outpost to place on the ground and assign commands outposts and fortresses provide healing outposts are occupied by 4 infantrycreeps and can be neutralised by killing all 4 you can capture an outpost by filling it with 4 of your own infantry or creeps you can use the outpost to your advantage by healing from it and producing units and deploying them from there generally if you have more outposts than the other guy youre well ahead in winning the game there some sockets on your fortress and sometimes a few on your outposts you can socket your socket units onto these to activate them or provide buffs to turrets to are 2 ways of winning a game the first is by having your opponent leave p the other way is by reducing your opponents fortress health to 0 there 2 ways to go about it you can do it traditionally by knocking on their door with an armyconvoy of tanks or by capturing all outposts on the map putting you into the dominating postition while the enemy in in domination their fortress slowly takes adamage after a 30 second warning this game mechanic promotes movining out and not slwo turely gameplaythis game often referrences other games and has special

Css,"man this game has got to be my most favourite game of all time you can probably tell from the amount of hours played d it is my most favourite game because it is extensive and fun because of the amount of content it provides this content includes downloadable maps weapons vehicles and more from the in game workshop and plentiful servers to play on i would definitely recommend it to any that is thinking of getting it because it is worth your time and your money pros a workshop that contains tons of varied addons to download plentiful servers to join plentiful gamemodes to play very good game to play with friends especially on certain maps it is extremely funny because of the physics and addons the game runs easily even if you have a bad computer you can spawn in things other people have made cons the graphics arent amazing but acceptable the servers on gmod use a lot of Css counter strike source textures meaning that you need to buy Css to see the textures although you dont need to do this but it is recommended because it will enhance the experience for new players setting up a private server to play with friends may be hard i watched tutorials on youtube on how to do it some addons take a while to download especially the larger file size addons and servers that you join require you to download the servers addons content although it really depends on the speed of your internet if its going to be fast or slowoverall this game is worth it and its only 10 10 freakin bucks dgmod receives a final overall score of 810"

The_Community,"i only have a few problems with dirty bomb from the 5 hours that i have been playing spawn campers yes the other team has the ability to spawn camp you and vice versa it needs to be fixed perhaps set up different spawns when the enemy gets too close to one of the spawns matchmaking is unbalanced for example i am only level 5 and i have been matched up several times with people that are lvl 20 and up they have access to much better guns classes and have much more experience and really for them it would be a sinch to beat all the low ranks on the opposing team unless we spend a good ammount of money we have to slowly grind to get the credits needed to get new classes better than the default ones and trust me it is very slow if you never win a match i have yet to find any aimbotters but damn sometimes i feel the need to question it also from what i have seen in alot of matches alot of The_Community playing is very toxic other than that the game is pretty good but these things need to be fixed probably not the toxic community however that will never be fixed for now i will not recommend this game but that could change"

Csgo,"if you are like me and want something more than the run and gun lack of strategy call of duty then Csgo is for you with its thrilling competitive gameplay its really a much better experience Csgo provides and enjoyable ranking system that pushes the user to play there best and engage in team based strategy at the higher levels as low ranks suck and are salty unlike cod and other fpss you can derank if too many games are lost however on the other hand there are negatives like hackers which can be a real pain and overall ruin the experience and the saltiness of the low silver ranks this is not really a bad thing but there are weapon skins that can be very expensive and if you dont restrain yourself you will have yourself throwing out the dosh in order to gain some of these sexy skins overall Csgo gives and amazing strategy based experience it has its negatives but are highly outweighed by the positives i recommend this game to anyone seeking a more skill based experience with less of the rpg style of cod cause lets face it cod is all about leveling up you character and getting new weapons a lot like other rpgsi hope this was helpful"

Well_There,"this game doesnt have enough attention it is a very good core game there are however alot of things wrong with this game dont get me wrong i like this game and recommend it but i cant say that it is perfect this game is a fpsrts hybrid it combines the elements of both genres really Well_There is one commander per team who directs up to 32 soldiers and builds buildings turrets and researches upgrades there are four main classes each with subclasses each sharing a class ability with different loadouts to adapt to different situations the soldiers main job is to destroy the enemy base and capture recource nodes and thats the jist of itnow onto the negativesone class is completely useless and that is the sabatour class he gets 3 c4 like explosives that do almost no damage to structers in fact the only class that can destroydamage any buildings is the exo class with the rocket launcher and even then it takes a bunch of them to do it quickly and by quicly i mean in a minute or two so unless you have a squad of 32 players that follow the commanders orders you are doomed to have an hour long game the weapons of the game are so varied you cant pick wich is worse form ultra recoil from assault rifles to the jittery sniper rifles to the bug zapping bazooka and of course the ultra sniping godly pistol all the weapons feel and sound horrible and are brokenbut now for the positivesthe two teams have different unit models and different buildings and building trees so it adds a diverse feel to the game this is one of the reasons i recommend it the empire have long range power relays but they need line of sight where as the consortion have wireless but shorter range that require no line of sightthe models of soldiers are really good and different depending on what side your are on and you can easily tell them apart from a distance and the classes are played like a game of rock paper scissors assualt beats scout scout beats exo and exo beats assualt engineer is supportall in all i give this game a 710 this game is good despite the problems with it"

Evolve,"early access reviewthe road so farark survival Evolved has its flaws currently as all day one games in ea but it has a lot of potential it has a deep levelling and crafting system requiring time and effort in gathering and crafting its combat is kind of clunky but once you unlock that slingshot youll never go back to just bashing a dinosaur while i haven ' t manage to tame a dinosaur yet started to tame a carno that had attacked my house but when i went to kill a couple of the massive turtle dinosaurs they wrecked my house and the passed out carno c i think it ' s an amazing and fun engaging mechanics making you care for that one pet you will value over the rest so far only the graphics to play this are letting it down in my opinion my specs below i hope with more optimization and when dx12 comes out soon it will get a lot better to list this outpro ' sdeep rewarding crafting systemlevelling systemmassive open world full of horrors and things that want you for foodfun tribe system with friendssolo offline mode allowing you to learn and get the hang of the game before onlinedevs actually seem to care and have updated the game and fixed bugs all thoughtout day oneconsrequires graphics tweaking even for higher cardssome small physics bugs eg bodys flying and being tossed away abitmostly the biggest con for people is it requires a beast of a machine and even then you need to tweak the graphicsbut after all that i ' ll keep playing it because i so far find this the most enjoyable survival game outcomputer specsprocessorintelr coretm i74790 cpu 360ghz graphics cardnvidia geforce gtx 760 ramkingston hyperx beast 160 gb osmicrosoft windows 81 64bit upgrading my gtx760 soon to a new gtx970 about 2ish weeks awaywill update my review when its installed ive played iti wish there was more than yesno for review early access games but so far if you can tweak the graphics right i recommend this over other early access survival gamesthanks for readingdeatheffektupdate 1 patch 171511 hours mostly all in game i doubt even an hour is in the menuserver list and i honestly say if you can get this running get it ive loved every second of itthe updates since day one have been great the game runs way better for me atleast and looks amazing the hard work the devs are doing will pay off and i honestly see this being finished one day if they keep doing this"

Team_Fortress_2,"wowi really really want to like this gamei dont know i guess i could go back to defiance first of all hasnt this game been coming out for like the last 9 years i was excited when i first caught coverage of it like 34 years ago but and secondly the game just looks awful graphically it looks like they are trying to marry the look of borderlands and Team_Fortress_2 and it just falls flat admittedly i have only started playing and as i play more i will update this review but the controls are weird you use the left trigger on your xbox controller to run left bumber jumps wtf some of the intro ai supports looked kind of interesting but if youre buying this as a kindof pc fpsmmo to rival the playstation 4 game destiny i think youre going to be pretty disapointed as ive said im early on and i will update this review i bought one of the starter packs for the game so im playing now but if you want to check it out it comes out and is freetoplay on the 29thin the mean time i have an beat access code for destiny on my ps4 so im going to go and play that oh yeah and pleease when you do a patch update the graphics theyrewell ive said that already"

Evolve,"ark survival Evolved is a fun and beautiful game i have played countless hours with friends and i have never been bored by it there is soo much to do in this game whether it be trying to tame a dinosaur you want or building a bridge to link the many forts and homes you will build i have never experienced playing the game on the epic settings but i have seen a few youtubers play at those setting and my oh my does the game look great now you may be wondering why i have not recommended the game that is due to the many problems that ark faces such as extreme memory leaks and subpar optimisation the memory leaks are a big problem for me as the game seems to eat up my ram and spit it back out at me i have heard the devs are trying to fix this issue but all i see is more content being put into the game which is good but also making the memory problem worse on mine and my friends pcs on multiple forum posts and other friends first hand experiences i have heard memory leaks of up to 23 gbs not very healthy for a computer if you ask me p all in all ark survival Evolved is a great game but it sure does need some tuning up and until some of the problems are fixed that are causing people like me and others to not be able to play the game properly i cant recommend the game to anyone unless they have a highend computer but if you really want to play this game i recommend that you atleast have 16 gbs of ram available if you want to run the game with modsedit i also forgot to mention that ark survival Evolved has some of the longest loading times i have ever seen so if you are fortunate enough to have an ssd with some room on it then install ark on there"
The_Community,"epsilon is not bad for what is being charged at the moment epsilon in its current state prealpha performs surprisingly well on lower end systems and looks half decent aswell epsilon features a few of the game mechanics that made the old tom clancy games great such as being able to preplan your mission rainbow six 3 the fiber optic camera to scout underneath doors splinter cell and eventually rainbow six and the ability to open doors incrementally to provide much more cover when scouting a room for enemies and making entry kills rainbow six 3 serellan llc are known for the subpar game takedown red sabre but it appears that the devs have taken into consideration what was wrong with the game as a tactical shooter and fixes a few of the problems in epsilon however it does carry some of the problems over like the somewhat sluggish movement system and the insanely fast reaction times of the enemy ai at times epsilon for what it is worth at the moment is not bad but you may want to hold off buying the game until some of the bugs and gameplay features are ironed out all in all i like where this game is heading and it is great to see tactical shooters like this and ground branch coming back into the gaming worldalso a message to the devs if they end up reading this dont be afraid to ask The_Community for suggestions on how to improve the game as we all want to see this become an amazing game and we are happy to help to make this game become better than it already istldr versionpros follows old style of tactical shooters such as rainbow six 3 and swat 4runs decently on older systems as far as i knowconsai isnt that great to be expected in a prealpha gamegame has bugs to be expected"

Css,"i recently went back and played both chaos rising and the original campain and everything just kinda clickedi realised that i did not enjoy them the first time i played because i never really got into the campains and kept trying skirmish i really loved dow dCss both had great campains and multiplayer features but dow2 is not these games it went from command of a large millitary force to a tight sqaudhero command game now at first i hated this but over time i found extreme joy in both campains of dow2 but the multiplayer due to lag and this new gameplay format i have found that it is the play style that works great in the campain but fails to capture the same feeling in mp unfornately retribution does not carry over this unique sqaud command play style into its campain and replaces it with the skirmish system for some reason even after making two games with this sqaudhero command system also while you could port your commander over from dow2 to chaos rising you can not do this in retribution and forces you to play as diomedes which is lame all up they screwed the continuity of the campains which just ruined my experience but last stand is very fun get some mates and youll have a gay old time there is joy to be found here sadly just not the same joy youd get from the first two games i do reccommend this game though as i did find joy but still kinda a let down with the campain"

Half_Life_2,"probably the weakest half life episode but still a fun game it picks up right after the ending to Half_Life_2 and thats all ill say without spoiling too much the story is definately the main thing that keeps you going in this the gameplay is very repetitive with not much variety it was pretty much like go into a new area clear out area repeat the game is very short but i consider that to be a good thing considering that if the game was longer than 5 hours most people would became extremely bored with it quickly with all the repeated gameplay however if you loved Half_Life_2 you will most likely love this next episode despite all the cons"

Dota_2,"ok ive reviewed it before but i feel like i should review it based on a perspective of a marvel fanboy an avid gamerthe game is really fun to play especially when you play this game with friends yes you either need to pay or work your way to a new hero but games like these expect you to work hard for rewards and working is better than just buying your way to victory graphics are ok for me on my laptop i like the fact that their adding more more heroes as the game grows i also like the fact that their adding more more to the story of the game making the game much more hyped for new players you got heroes voiced by some of the most talented voice actors ever like deadpool voiced by the great nolan north the gameplay itself is enhancing you get to experience different movesets per hero get to really play your hero more in order to perfectly master their moves with pvp soon to be out of beta the ingame dialogue and the fact that heroes can actually have conversations with each other is down right awesome more heroes great story hard work just wat you can expect from mmorpgsand also i also saw a review that a person does not recommend the game because he wants the game to be optimized to xbox controllers try playing Dota_2 with an xbox controller then update your reviewoverall yeah get the game it may be high in memory their may be big updates but throughout all that its all gon na be worth itscore for marvel fansavid mmorpg gamers 9510score for nonmarvel people 7310"

Tf2,"prosget a Tf2 weaponconseverything else"
Tf2,"it is a great game overall although i would want to have more maps and game modes make the match making faster that is not the case however it shows the true face of a paytowin game it feels like the developers slapped me in the face for not spending a dollar on their market a shame thats what it is it had great potential although the cash shop overpowering your opponents by spending money ruins it and no its not me being bad im great at the game but you can never dominate a player who has the best ingame items no matter the skill then it becomes frustrating to play you will eventually quit it like i did so i beg you spend your time on something else like Tf2"
Csgo,"better than Csgo because its simply more directmakes more movement such as climbing over and using ladders propperly with hands stealth kills since the characters all are technically robots and half human with most part of their bodies being prostetics for human use and combat seems quite reasonable that they are hard to kill throught the head but is still not necessarily hard to shot someones head over 4 times in less than second since the rapid fire weapons can do the job just finethe graphics are amazing the music is deep and motivating is ways that would want you to keep perseverant depending in what kind of person you are mentality stabilitygraphics effects are good when headshot kill on an enemy occurs sometimes the head would be in pieces and see the insides or see just the half of the head remaining attached to the body kills made by explosives will mostly torn your character into pieces and usually the extremities will the ones getting off the bodies arms legs sometimes the head or half torso etc theres too much detail the little issue is when someone is getting shot theres gon na be a lot of blood splatting per hit most games would make the blood be spilled and stay on the surfaces this game doesnt do much of that but its that much of an issuethe combat skills such are tier 1 and tier 2 in most characters are fitting on science fiction and real science such as optical cloak this is an example is not necessarily accurate due the movility would disturb this ability you can download the tier 1 version of the team mate if they use a tier 2 skills its temporal and weaker but still near similar to the original character whom you downloaded the tier skill works as long as youre near host of the tier skill and up to 3 other players that are not youtheres currently two female ressembling characters on this gamei could say more of this but i think this is enough for now this game is great for casual play or competitive play if it gets further such as having a competitive community it has the potential for iti give it 1010 shooter game with science fiction and covert arts"
Team_Fortress_2,"awesome and addciting game really fun when u have one or two of your friends play with you the mechanics are sort of similair to that of Team_Fortress_2 with the rocket jumps the only downside is theres not enough maps to play on and overtime the maps get boring otherwise great game"
The_Community,"great game fun with friends but also fun while your playing by yourself The_Community is good and you can see your feet i would give this game 110 you have to put hours in to be good at the game and unlock things i guess you could say its a bit of a grindbut its so rewarding when you get the good weapons its also easy to get xp by doing the right things in the game the graphics arnt the greatest but still you are still able to deal with them"

Portal,"this is most likely one of the greatest sandbox games on the steam webstore with plenty of things to do from making a floating piece of wood with some decorations to a motorised bathtub to a fully functunal ship or just stack up wooden objects and set them on fire and if the vanilla version doesnt grab your tastes get some addons this game has an outstanding number of addons that can be downloaded with a click of a button some addons are made for great new building experiences take expression 2 and wiremod for example with the use of wiremod you can create working doors and other things not that good with wiremod so cant give detailed explanation and with expression 2 you can make holograms teleporters and big explosions although this is an amazing game and i highly recommend it to anyone whos looking for a unique sandbox experience there is probably only one thing that i dislike about it and its that if you dont have certain games like half life or counter strike some textures and models wont work this include black and pink checkerboxes and big flashing errors signs luckily i have found a way around this check out this website to get free models and textures from games such as Portal half life and counter strike link removedhttpkajar9wixcom heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit 2 go to the garrycontent tab to gain access to the resources this is not piracy it is not letting you play seperate games for free it is simply giving you textures and models for gmod other than that issue i give it a rating of 910 definately got my moneys worth"
The_Community,"i used to play this game hours on end unfortunately when i came back The_Community was dead there were no players anywhere apart from the few newbies wandering through the starting area hoping to find a good game i would only recommend this if you like grinding hours on end and spamming repeats to level through most of the game as well as completing raids with only a few party members and in most circumstances by yourself"

Evolve,"at the current state the games content is mostly Evolved around escort everyone and babysit everyoneaside from the quests which makes the story more interesting gathering resources became a one man job mostly because you can only call for 1 scavenger at a time and they will walk to the destination and collect a single sack of loot then return home which seems helpful at first but later found out these so called scavengers will very often stuck and call for help which then the player has to go and bail them out alot of cases when i finally get to them there is very few zombies around the scavenger will not move until the area is clearedmoving onto the combat there is one thing bugs me greatly at home base suppressor can be crafted in the work shop which is used to allow guns to be silenced until it is worn out but there is no projectile weapon such as crossbow and bow either these and the arrowbolt they use will be much easier to craft then the suppressor itself and produce less noise when used compared to a firearmmelee combat seems interesting at first but i found it very lacking in damage progression at max fighting skill level it will still require at least 2 swings with a heavy weapon to get the zombie into a state where excute mechanics can be used power attacksprint and attack does virtually nothing better then a normal attack except more time consumingthe quest generally consist holding off zombies and clear the area or hunt down a certain zombiemy conclution the mechanics of this game in general has out paced its stories since it keeps adding timed events which will penalise the player for missing them on top of the quest story supply gathering and the restriction around those so you can not do more then 1 quest at a time even if they consist the same sort of goal multiple supplies can not be loaded onto cars and must be carried by someone in order to take homeedit 1 since it has been updated and i will go back into playing this for a bit and make changes to my review"
Terraria,"Terraria is an amazing game many people compare it to minecraft but its much more combat based with bosses beasts in the night and countless weapons from assault rifles and bows to swords and magic spells however it has no storyline quests or any of the sort yes you can do fishing quests and catch specific fish for the npc but more of storyquesting would improve the experience just a bitoverall its crazy fun especially in multiplayer completely recommended910"
Dont_Starve,"dont starve is an incredible game the graphics are a unique and endearing style the controls nicely set out and the challenge of the game all combine to make it what it is probably one of my favourite parts about this game discluding the graphics which i love is having only one life you die its game over unless you have stumbled upon a rare touchstone granting you an extra life you have to be ready and think ahead to avoid losing everything and when you get to low health its time to go into panic mode there are so many dangers keeping an eye on your hunger picking flowers to avoid going insane having enough light to last through the night and all the monsters found in this game make it an amazing experience the crafting aspect of the game is also very nicely done collecting the resources and building the machines you need to advance further into the game the only downfall is the inability to multi this game and share this experience with your friends it would be amazing to be able to play Dont_Starve with your friends competing against or looking after each other but sadly it is not able to be done all in all this game is an unforgettable experience that i will keep coming back to time and time again to try and get further than i did last time and to see what i missed out on because i hadnt made it that far yet910"

The_Community,"this game is geuinely great and it gets better if you make the smallest purchase on the steam store The_Community is massive and has its own trading currency built into it by the millions of fans out there i love this game because the 9 classes are so balenced and well made and any server you play on is fun no matter the map1010 the true savior"

Evolve,"how bout no hundreds of things were promised the game still needs to undergo optimization the game makes it immpossible to progress ark your better off getting ark survival Evolved its 100 times better than this and even expands on the basics i have survived longer on ark with dinosaurs chasing me then i have with falling through the mapoverall do not buy this game unless for 250 or lower i think this group who made this game made reign of kings do not buy that either because you will be disspointed with the same reult and unfinished buggy game still in early access honestly i have no idea how this made it out of early access"

The_Culling,"had tons of fun before i switched over to windows 10 alot of people are also having problems playing on windows 10 so if you are on windows 10 be careful because it might not work i actually had alot of fun on battle royal so did alot of people and why h1z1 was popular and the devs took that in account and decide to do the thing that would make the players angryseprate the battle royal mode and the surival mode and charge 24 for each game yes you heard me 24 dollars for each bloody game even though if u originally owned the game you wouldnt need to buy battle royal again that means for new players its really daunting if you havnt checked out The_Culling it is a better version and a better vision for what a battle royal game should be do not buy"

Csgo,"probably the best fps out there its fun fast a potato could run it and it dosent have like 10 billion dlcs why is Csgo better than other fps games such as cod because it is addictive and has a healthy growth in the community population this game is 3 years in and still going strong in fact stronger than ever its community has expanded a lot with now over 6 hundred thousand players at peak see the steam graph here httpsteamchartscomapp730 a reason why it is better than its rivals is because it doesnt die off in a few years take cod mw1 for an example no doubt it was a great game with great single player and revolutionary multiplayer but it is dying why due to lack of support from its devs and lack of content Csgo technically could have unlimited game modes due to the games support of community made mods which are player made and player funded this ability to mod the game allows for new gamemodes and thousands of hours of more fun than just vanilla Csgo even vanila Csgo is still very enjoyable even with 500 hours on it overall a great game for its price and almost unlimited things to do"

Starbound,"Starbound it is a nice little game that still needs to work on the biomes and planets but i guess i can let it go this time only because it is in beta stage i have to admit this is a nice game that you could play for a few hours then you have to restart because you either 1 think your guy is too overpowered or 2 want to see what other worlds have instore for you i give it a 610 only because it is still in beta stage but it still is pretty good"

Terraria,"at first glance Terraria seems to be a lackluster indie game with a clunky confusing interface and a list of crafting options a mile wide especially for you minecraft transplants you ' ll initially find the flat sidescrolling perspective a bit offputting after countless hours having been spent in an immersive 3d environment take some time to adjust your lenses however and you ' ll discover a game that ' s both deep and almost endlessly entertainingin Terraria you are plopped into a randomly generated world your only task is to explore survive and thrive survival isn ' t even top of your " todo list " as the minor penalty of losing coins upon death is nothing more than a momentary setback for the most part the real driving force behind Terraria is its amorous advances of exploration drawing you in with suggestive displays of pots and vases in surfacelevel caves before luring you deeper with promises of heaving chests and rich oresthere is a wealth of fun to be had with this game but accessing it can be an insufferable challenge to start out without any solid tutorials ingame your left to wander the world clueless as to what to do the guide a starting npc can give you useful tips hereandthere but without any discernible goal to achieve it ' s hard to see the appeal at first building a shelter is a confusing chore crafting weapons an alien concept and survival at night is a daunting task plus once you ' ve mastered single player you can take your character online to tackle all the challenges the world has to offer with a few friends or simply start from scratch and carve a new adventure boss battles are certainly easier but nevertheless challenging for the small price to buy into this title you ' ll get more than your moneys worth in gameplay available to buy through steamnow if you ' ll excuse me i ' ve got some hellstone armour to craft a demon alter to find and an eater of worlds to slayscore by yourself 510with friends 8510"
Tf2,"tf2 is a massively multiplayer game with lots of game modes to choose from and 9 unique classes to play teamwork is essential in this game and unlike many other games it has trade servers where you can trade items and acheivement idle servers this is by far one of the best free to play games on Tf2 there are many hats and weapons for you to acquire including strange weapons and killstreak weaponsthat was before the love and war update now in my opinion i think that there are way too many taunts in this game first there were a few and that didnt affect the game a lot but now in nearly every server someone has to be doing the conga taunt i like the conga taunt but when you use it most people will forget what the main purpose of this game is kill nevertheless i still love playing this game score 9510 too many random taunts in the game"

Csgo,"spent my childhood playing this game on my dads computer but it got corrupted and i lost my only copy of counterstrike source finally one day i found out about this amazing game and it changed my life 110 would reccommend is what i would like to say except the Csgo community is filled with people that think a sniper rifle which is designed for long distance combat is for quickscoping noobz and if you hardscope like youre meant to use a sniper rifle youre considered a noob people dont care about skill anymore and only care about the expensive skins for weapons you can get Csgo is now a digital gun camo collector 110"
Tf2,"team fortress 2 is not your typical first person shooter sure you can shoot people and blow them up but what sets this game apart from the typical fps is its creativity this game is not logical this game is not realistic but yet it does what its meant to do so well the game has nine classes to choose from offensive defensive and support each with different roles the scout for example must capture objectives and deal with his foes quickly while a heavy will draw attention and tank or a medic which will support objective based players or the tanky heavies there are also more unorthadox classes like the engineer which construct mechanical toys for their allies to use to their advantage one of the more unique classes the class everyone hates but everyone plays is the spy the spy can shapeshift into a member of the other team and sneak behind enemy lines and score an instakill backstab with their trusty knife they can also turn invisible and disable engineer machines the classes work in perfect harmony with each other with each class benifiting the team in a way the game is free to play but by no stretch is it pay to win everything you can pay for can be obtained by finding it in game or trading for it and the trading community is strong and well populated which makes it easy to trade skill is a more dominant factor as what use is the best gun in the game if a new player is using it this is where lots of free to play games fail but this is where team fortress 2 stands out to sum up Tf2 is a great game that involves heavy use of teamwork and the best bit is its free you can obtain the best items in the game without paying a dime which makes me give this game a910"

Metro_2033,"metro last light is a stunningly atmospheric and haunting firstperson shooter in which you play artyom the young man who saved humanity from the threat of the dark ones at the conclusion of Metro_2033 you must take up arms once more to save the metro from impending doom 1 this time however the threat is much closer to home at every turn you will be reminded of the desolation of the nuclear catastrophe that ended the world as we know it the ghosts of the dead the ruins of moscow and oncegreat landmarks like the kremlin and the dirty shambolic metro townships all elicit some measure of the despair and sadness that plagues what is left of humanity as they attempt to survive the grave new world their destruction has left behind the topnotch graphics and soundwork make the world extremely immersive and realistic the gameplay fits well with the atmosphere the game provides with scarce ammunition the bullet currency system deadly enemies and regular stealth sections all coming together to give the impression of bareknuckled survival the enemy ai is a bit lacklustre at times but this is only noticeable in a few cases it generally makes you feel very vulnerable and threatened at all times for a game made by a relatively small team of developers this is an awesome achievement also the soundtrack is just perfect910 do recommend"

Evolve,"now dont get me wrong i love this game a lot it started out as this ambitious little title that spawned from a simple mod in roblox of all things to now being a widely played charming game that gained numerous fans and a good community it has been great to follow along with the creator of the game and watch it Evolve into a poor mans dayz while maintaining a very good aspect of fun and survival but much to my and many other peoples dismay some recent updates to the game have been a little troubling what i am mainly talking about is the inclusion of new zombie types which is very reminiscent of special infected from left 4 dead now this is not a bad thing a bit of challenge and variety in the ways of enemies is great and very entertaining but that is where the good parts of the update end in my experience being a bambi on a new or even long played server is tough as the persistent threat of bandits and zombies is a constant looming hazard and without gear or teammates to aid you you are likely to die very quickly thankfully the zombies were easy to fight off and bandits were semieasy to avoid but with the inclusion of these dangerous new zombie types it has made things for bambis in particular and even gamesmart and geared players so much harder the mega zombie which is usually a zombie people avoid like the plague due to his incredible stength and close to one shot kills is now able to almost kill you instantly from a distance with a hunk of thrown concrete because apparently the mega zombie wasnt powerful enough then there is the fire zombie which when killed explodes in fire making melee combat near impossible spreads to other zombies which in turn makes them fire zombies also which means if there is a fire zombie in a horde and you kill it there will be a giant horde of fore zombies coming towards you next is the spitter zombie which shoots acid at you from a long distance and can kill you very quickly if you are in a gear menu and unawares to his presence lastly is the zombies that can turn invisible and can kill you extremely quickly because you cant see them at all even with the faint purple outline that doesnt help at all also there is the fast quadriped zombie but that can be killed quickly so it isnt as bad in conclusion unturned is an excellent game that i want to keep growing and getting better but it is currently being hindered by new zombie types that make the game so unnecassarily harder especially for fresh spawns maybe if some of these zombies were removed which i know is hard process or maybe nerfed to a reasonable level it would make the game just a little less difficult tldr the new zombies make the game too difficult and need a nerf or removal"

Portal,"i recommend this to any fans of the Portal series who like a bit of the mindfck i found it a very fun but challenging gameits hard it runs surprisingly well at a steady 60fps on my bad computer also good to mention it may say controller controls but if you mess around with youre keyboard during a level you can find the controlsi findfound it a nice little game and it even has coop which i have not tried910"
Terraria,"essentualy this game is like Terraria but it has a lot of differences making it scary and amazingly fun to play for the scary part try having a massive cute furry creature that looks harmless jump at your face and one hit you because usually the passive mobs actually are the scaryiest looking tenticale goops of goop that youve see another side note this games construction make you both sad and crazy for all the right reasons 1 youre going to make the coolest looking base then tt ditch it to make and even cooler one in a new sector 2 if youre the type to get agressive really fast dont try to tank mobs because death in this game is like paintball if youre hit your back to the start to try all over again have fun"

Besiege,"this war of mine is another game that has come out in recent times that is an absolute gem along with this and Besiege there are at least some games that are being made and developed that are utterly amazing this was my favourite game of 2014 and id recommend it to anyone even if this isnt your genre of game get it wait for a sale if you must i feel like this should be a game played by everyone at least once it will really show the horrors and mistakes that war brings couple flaws with it obviously such as replayability personally i like to set myself challenges now i know the grips of this game whenever i feel like playing it i think of something to do could be boring for some but i still find the game playable like my most recent challenge was to stay inside for as long as i could just buying and selling materials obviously didnt last very long as traders come in a blue moon but it was still interesting to watch foodwatersupplies begin to dwindle and the reactions i would give when traders eventually did show up then when they had nothing i neededas the trailer says there are things ive done in this game im not proud of and would like to think that its only a game that brings out such a side that steals from elderly because i needed food so badly but this game this experience is something that really does bring out human nature whatever choices you make just experience this little war of mine"
Tf2,"primal carnage cs Tf2 realistic dinosaurs"
Portal,"warning this review contains spoilers of the gameok this mod is brilliant whoever thought of this is genius the game mechanics of Portal are changed but nonetheless still have the same feel to it and although confusing at first you get used to themthe only things that really sucks about this game are three things1 theres this part where you have to deactivate some machines and stuff you have to go on an insane track of jumping and speeding and everything except my instincts told me to go to this little square in the wall but when it said to skip the section ahead i didnt read it properly and jumped it to it and the worst part is that it doesnt even skip it it plays someone playing it which was really lame i was really disappointed and i didnt want to play through the whole chapter again for that one bit2 like Portal almost no replay value3 the ending of the game is just really bad this new personality core called nigel who is likeable and funny has been hinted as evil and wants to kill you towards the end of the game but the ending is just a copy and paste of the original Portal youre on a platform descending into fire and because your paint gun was deactivated there was no way to avoid it the game even points out the loophole of you not needing to die and the last thing you hear is just nigel describing the rising temperature and then the credits roll this left a really bad taste in my mouth and it just felt the same but worse because at least in Portal theres a lot more even after you think the inevitable that really sucked and i didnt like the ending really and theres not even really any end in sight of the game it just sort of endsbut overall this game is worth the money its got a community workshop which is pretty cool granting lots of possibilites if youre a fan of Portal 2 youll like this gameprosgreat mechanicsgreat gameplaygood voice actingconsending isnt up to par with the rest of the gameno replay value reallyno real easter eggs of sorts810"
Garrys_Mod,"i love Garrys_Mod first up ive had some of the best times playing with friends on sandbox and trouble in terrorist town and murder and things like that there are infinite add ons and so much fun to be hadbut the multiplayer public servers are awful sometimesif you have no friends online and you dont feel like sandbox you can go on to multiplayer online to open servers to play tt murder prop hunt etc but the people on these servers are just awful most of the time what ive noticed is that theres a very limited selection of the types of people in Garrys_Mod either its the squealers that have the most annoying voices sometimes and say vulgar things or 18 year olds that sound like they have nothing to do with their lives im not saying all people are like this but its just how it usually is rdmers in tt are the worst who kill for no reason and another thing in tt is how people are suspicious of the littlest of things i can not recommend the multiplayer serversanother cheap sort of way to get money is to buy counterstrike source along with it thats another 15 on the 10 price tag and you like me may think i dont want to buy it and will probably wonder why it comes as a bundle see the thing is that in Garrys_Mod if you dont have the certain texture or addon for an item or map there will be huge red error signs and purple and black squares so you cant see the items and some of the neccesities for this game in terms of maps and textures come with counterstrike source and if you dont you have to go online and find all the textures and all the maps in a bundle open up your steam folder and dragging them in these packs take about half an hour to download and you need to download all the gamemodes excess maps and so many other things if you want to play online properly i mean come on at least give us a warning guys to me this seems like a ripoff if you didnt know and a cheap way of getting moneyoverall i really love Garrys_Mod but i love it the most when im playing with friends on a private match or by myself in sandbox if youre gon na buy it for online multiplayer i do not recommend it if youre going to buy it to play with friends and the occasional online multiplayer i fully recommend itprosfun gameplaygreat gamemodesa lot to do and downloadconsbad communitytextures and addons sometimesi will keep Garrys_Mod at a 710i know this is a very negative review but i just wanted to let you know the bad about gmod before you buy it"
The_Community,"this game is mildy enjoyable for the first few hours you play it during the first few hours youre matched with people in the low level group where things are fair and mostly even once you pass those few levels youll hit the biggest pay wall ive ever experience everyone you verse will have payed weapons you just cant compete with and amazing gear that makes your really bad weapons ever worsein the terms of match making the queue times are pretty short a minute or so to get in game youll be lucky to get into the medium connection speeds if youre not in the us and the majority of The_Community doesnt speak english anyway which is terrible for such a tactical shootertry it if you want but youll suffer under the might that is pay to win"

Tf2,"a once great game that has been totally merkled by forcing half baked matchmaking on an unwilling communitynow instead of playing Tf2 you will spend 80 of the time searching for a game waiting for a loading screen waiting for players and staring at end of round scores you can no longer choose what map to play on or region you play in or even stop the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit matchmaking from putting you in a server with 400 ping this happens to me 13 connects when you do finally get a game there is no voting hackers off no scrambling for evening of teams long periods of 12v8 generally every game is a one sided stomp"

Portal,"firstly id like to say that this game is very far up on my favourite games of all time alongside games of completely different genres such as fallout 2the setting for Portal is unclear immediately but you quickly become aware of the fact that you are a test subject for aperture labs whcih cements its place in the halflife universe guided by an omnipresent voice you make your way through the different chambers of increasingly difficult testsalthough this synopsis may make this game seem somewhat shallow it most certainly is not the main character chell although mute develops a personality regardless an attachment is created with this voice guiding you and most cryptically is the hidden areas in the chambers these give background into aperture laboratories the voice and possibly the sole survivorwhen compared to Portal 2 Portal does have some significant flaws this include a lack of characters and personality which although there isnt built upon until later in the game there arent as many testing mechanics in the original but this leads to much more creative test designes requiring ingenuity over resourcesoverall this game is amazing and you will fell dissapointed upon its completion Portal 2 builds upon the first and is a must after this is completed"

Terraria,"Terraria is the cool think to do"
Terraria,"okay so ive already praised this game and all its features but theres just been a massive update it has completely overhauled every detail of the game and it honestly does not have the same feel it is so much more awesome the matter manipulator is useful now combat is much more challenging and fun but most importantly it doesnt feel like Terraria 2 anymore this game was already unique enough as it was but now this could honestly be released as a full game right now and i wouldnt complain but these guys know why minecraft and Terraria did well i only have a few nitpicks like all ore is significantly rarer wtf are core fragments but i digress if you liked Terraria you are going to play this for ages it is accessible but can provide a pretty good challenge its good buy it"
Csgo,"counterstrike global offensive is another installment in the games series and is quite an amazing game really i only got to get this game through steam sales and the normal price tag of the game will explain the seemingly unreasonable prices for good weapon skins on steam marketanyway about this counterstrike game it is a great fps for a comparably cheaper price than other wellknown ones and provides a good player base for people from australia to play i am only mentioning aust but its a wide spread game and playing with friends is actually fun the ranking system i guess is adequate but sometimes a little offthemark sometimes the system pairs you up with really high ranked people leaving you behind in the scoreboard i understand that when moving up from silver to nova makes u verse novas but sometimes its a little unfairall in all Csgo is a great game not just to play by yourself get your friends on this d its an amazing game by valve"

Tf2,"my good Tf2 game"
Team_Fortress_2,"ive never been particularly fond of multiplayer shooters from my limited experience they have this intial rush that feels pretty good but that feeling slowly fades to leave behind a bleak and dry experience they just seem to lack the engaging elements that singleplayer games have and use so wellthats not the case with Team_Fortress_2 though this game is fun not only is the gameplay deep intuitive and interesting but it also accentuates the style and the style accentuates it the characters are surprisingly fleshed out and i would recommend reading some of the comicsoverall give it a go"

Evolve,"a little story to describe my game experience in ark survival Evolved i had supported this game since the beginning so dont get the idea i was a newbro had rolled up over 700 hours in a few months alonei was recently globally banned yes globally as in all servers not just the one i was on for refusing to change my tribe name from the band name cky when i questioned the admin who threatened me with expulsion why i had to change it he globally banned me when i contacted studio wildcard directly to repeal the ban and even went as far to send video and screen captured evidence of the conversations i was completely ignored i now have a basically useless game on my steam list all due to an overzealous ban happy admin with an itchy buttonfingeralso the admin banned my partners account for no reason whatsoever just in case i was playing on her account too its not often you get server admins and developers who are less mature than their player base thanks wildcardoh also the frame rate sucks even on modern super computers and the gameplay is kind of stale in the current market110 simply because i was able to drown most of my own dinos before he banned me would ride a trex into the ocean depths again"

Tf2,"warhammer 40k eternal crusade looks very promising but it is important to note that in its current state it is more of a combat demothe final game will be a open world mmo shooter while in its current state its a pvp session shooter session shooters are games like Tf2 and rainbow 6 siege"

The_Community,"this is a great game for younger gamers its basically a minecraft dayz mixed game but more of dayz but less bugs than dayz its quite hard to believe that a 16 year old named nelson sexton made this game all by himself and so far ive got over 100 hrs in game and im loving it its got simple graphics but it makes up for it because it gives you a chance to feel a ive got to survive this feeling and thats what i love about these games although there arent many aussie servers that are 247 online its still got great potenicial and i think nelson could potencially make the game even greater than what it already is and if he chooses to let The_Community do the features when 30 comes out with the workshop modding api maybe itd get more purchases for gold but i think if you buy gold its not just about the features but actually that your supporting the development and pushing the game along so it can be what The_Community wantsthe survival featuresyou can basically run around a town and find a melee weapon anywhere but when you find a gun you know youve got to save the ammo and dont be a complete idiot and shoot in a town full of zombies and make them chase after you and when you run out of ammo youve got to quickly equip a melee weapon and thats fun as ive died like over a million times by doing that and the experienceskills are great but i guess their could be more unqiue skills but when i got all the skills i was partying with chemlights until a zombie came and killed me because i put my weapons in my chest and that was the end of my skills well not exactly the end of them they give you back half of your skills but when youve got like 3 levels of one skill once you die youll get 1 level in that skill back over all the survival features are awesomethe crafting featuresthe crafting is a little hard to get used to so you may have to google the recipes up like i did a thousand times and the great thing about it is that you can refill your bullets so if you found a gun in a town then itd be a civillian gun so you can use civillian bullets to refill it but i was confused when i had a swift mag because when i click on it the desc says its a military grade mag but i cant use military bullets to refill it thats because you need civil bullets because its found in civillian areas aswell as military but when you create a house you can bascially start putting some skills in crafting and outdoors if you have crafting level one you can craft a crate that doesnt lock so anyone can open it and steal stuff but also with level 1 crafting you can make some stone crafting recipes when you have level 2 crafting aka max crafting you can craft either a chest which is locked and has 6 slots and the metal locker that has the same 4 slots but i guess is harder to break with a sledge hammer and other melee weapons also with crafting level 2 you can make metal building materials which the person who placed it is the only one who can open or close it you can also craft other stuff out of cloth and gear like attachments and etc but overall it would be really good if the person who placed the building material could actually pick it up if they placed it in the wrong spot or just simply want to movei love this game and i would seriously recommend buying a permenant gold upgrade although i havent done it yet im going to so i can support nelson and i rate it 1210 d best of luck to nelson sexton to making 30 possible"

Portal,"overall i quite liked most of it and recommend it its free anywaythe timetravel mechanic is very nicely executed and a lot of fun to figure outfrom the start of the game i found myself having a lot of fun with it having it there adds a new very interesting mechanic that really puzzles the brain like very few Portal mods can really achievehowever this game suffers from a lot of very common problems that plague Portal 2 mods and mapsthe maps are needlessly huuge in a lot of areas you just walk and walk merely to push a button and then you have to backtrack it does get a little pedantic especially once youve figured out what youre supposed to do a lot of it is to make way for the custom storythis is made worse by the fact there is hardly any surfaces you can actually place a Portal on in fact some whole levels see you never even using the Portal gun so a lot of walkingthe game seemed to quickly drop logical challenges and veer towards timingacrobatic puzzles which i personally hate this seems to apply to the jump on your clone and get launched in the air mechanic where sometimes you get stuck in her headbut none of these happen in the early levels so you can simply download it fire it up and play it as long as you enjoy itand of course some people likely enjoy some of the above mechanics or dont mind them"

Csgo,"counterstrike is just one of those games that lives on in the world of gaming and few equal its prestige in competitive gameplay and esports global offensive is the best edition so far and despite using the same maps again and again it dosent seem to get old new people trial and error of past play and the situation thats right in front of you changes the game for you despite it being a map youve played over and over again the fact that you only get one life just makes you jumpy and worried about what could be around ever corner which is a good thing as you respet the one life your given and try your best as you would in real life not to lose itmore often then not you play with good people who dont bag you out just becuase you miss a shot or make a mistake however just like any other gaming community you do have people who hack troll and are just plain salty sometimes but when you play online you take those risks the gun skins just add a extra feel to the game of making each gun your own with added stickers but it hurts even more when your shot by your own gun the keys mite be a little more expensive then what youll get mostly but i like that at least you have that option you know if you have money to spare watching pro matches on live streams while depressing that you may never be that god like its amazing to see what some people can manage to pull off in this game and gives you some ideas you could try in your gameplaylots of servers and a active community Csgo is a game you must play at least once"

Nether,"this is a very good game but i have two very major gripes with itfirst is that there are no australian servers this can be slightly excusable but i like to know that my country exists to other people one or two servers based in somewhere like adelaid or sydney would be great this is frustrating because that means that your austrailian market is required to join the asian servers that have over 150ms of ping thats 1 second too many you have already died by the time youve realised youve been shot australians are really at a disadvantage because of thissecond are the random and rather critical flaws and bugs i know that this will eventually be fixed with development but that does not fix their current presence in the game they can range from small things like your character stuck moving forward for a time which can be fatal in a fight or range from big things like your character randomly suffering from a terminal cardiac arrest and promptly dying losing all of your gear and progress as ive said this problem will eventually be fixed with development but they still exist todaydespite all this i highly reccommend this game because of the amount of times i have become stressed angry annoyed and felt truly alone while playing it these are all very good things because that is what the game is focused on survival by any means in a cruel hard and desolate environment i cant count the amount of times ive raged at another player because he took my stuff after giving my brain a new ventilation hole or have felt the heart thudding adreniline of escaping from mortal peril or coming down from a euforic high after destroying several different types of Nether then being shot by another playerits good fun if you are looking for an rpgish guns guts and glory postapocolyptic survival game where anything goesone thing ive noticed is that no matter your level or how good you think you are in this game someone can still best you if they have just started out if they are smart its an even playing field with some barricades optional be warned and have fun"

The_Culling,"The_Culling a last man standing multiplayer deathmatch game with survival elements basic crafting looting basic resource gathering its a battle royaleesque game though more like the condemned imo that takes place inside a dome with 16 contestants and up to 25 minute roundsthe game itself has a good concept but overall it feels quite cheapthe melee combat system uses a rock paper scissors mechanism consisting of attack block shove the balancing with the system is fine imo no complaints here shoving briefly staggers the opponent or defeats their block for those wonderingthe system is quite clunky in its current state though seeing as melee combat is essentially the main aspect of the game it is quite disappointing the feedback when you land a blow or get struck isnt great either rust has better melee feedback that isnt saying muchadd bad netcode and high latency servers on top of that and it just feels very sloppy aws cloud servers btw horrible for realtimetwitch games i hope they eventually move to proper dedicated serversi understand its in early access but compared to the other early access games ive played this is lacking i really wanted to like this game but the basic elements that make up the core gameplay have been i wouldnt say poorly but rather crudely executedhonestly i would probably come back to this game sometime in the future once more time has been spent developing the core mechanics i see a promising future ahead for this game as long as they iron out the kinks and continue working on and improving the current foundations of the game but i dont see that happening for at least another 6 months so thats why i can not recommend the game at this point in time"

Evolve,"strong contender for game of the year 2012 dishonored utilizes a fantastic universe and exceptional gameplay to tell the revenge tale of corvo attanothe game is exceptionally opened giving the player true customization over how they wish to achieve their task which typically rEvolve around disposing fatally or not of key targets the really appealing aspect of the game is each area is fairly open giving the player the choice on how they wish to achieve their task which can range from stealhy sewer trecking utilizing magic to not be seen and nonlethally deal with targets or a more confronting method in which you unleash swarms of rats and shoot foes in the facethe setting of the game is also extremely cool the city of dunwall is full of steampunk achievements plague carrying rats and victims known as weepers and a secretive occult to the enimatic outsiderbuy this game"

The_Community,"new update so after four months the game finally got an update all it took was the game being pulled from sale on steam seems very suspicious as The_Community was in uproar for months with no word from the dev jig then within two weeks of the game getting pulled from sale we suddenly get an updateas for the content one new dinosaur which was already in the game files and unlocked by modders months ago stampedes which consist of 30 dinosaurs running around eachother in circles instead of the normal one or two a trap mechanic which is poorly implemented and a couple of value changes i doubt the dev spent more than a couple hours on itid hold out on any purchase of this game untill we get a steady steam of updates and a promise from the dev that they arnt going to just dissapear as soon as the money starts coming back in the game has potential but i honestly dont know if the dev has the ability to finish itupdateits now been over two months there have been 0 updates in that time no ones heard anything from the devs and it turns out that the pr manager governor ostrich was a freelancer whos contract expired may 31st no updates no word from devs stay clear"
The_Community,"huge open world loads of stuff to build considering its only been out a few days decent graphics much less lag than before they patched it ignore the negative reviews by people that dont understand what an early access is these are honestly some of the nicest devs ive seen and they will work their asses off to make sure this game gets better and better have a look in The_Community forum and ask em a question if you want the fact that theyll answer it is an absolute breath of fresh air compared to some devs and your response will come way quicker than youd expect"
Well_There,"summary - prostfun gameplay and tight controlstgreat atmosphere music visuals and storytdoesn ' t outstay its welcomeconstsome dodgy sound effectstfrustrating at timestbalance issuesscore - 710short fun and cheap worth picking up dextended reviewhalo spartan assault is a fun and short game it took me just over 3 hours to complete the campaign and most of the time i was enjoying myself the controls are great for a pc port the graphics are good considering this is a pc port there are all the basic video settings but i often encountered a bug where upon tabbing out the game would exit full screen and enter a small window and i was unable to revert back to full screen without relaunching the game a small hindrance due to the short levels but it does get annoying on to the actual gameplay and atmosphere now the gameplay is fun and rather simple top down shooter with a few objectives to complete over a 38 minute long level there are a variety of objectives that never overstay their welcome or reoccur too often there also additional challenges in the form of both assault ops and weekly challenges spartan assault rewards kills with a simple points system points are rewarded per kill and vary in quantity for what you kill medals can also be earned through killing enemies in a certain way the same as medals in other halo games depending on the amount of points earned during a mission xp is rewarded after the game to purchase additional weapons armour abilities and boosters for damage shield regen and points for a single mission skulls difficulty modifiers can be applied to earn more xp there is a great selection of enemies vehicles weaponry and gadgets at your disposal enemies react well and behave as you would expect from a halo game there are a large selection of enemies that you encounter ranging from meek grunts to tough and aggressive brute chieftains vehicles look very good in spartan assault but some tanks and wraiths suffer from some clunky controls all weapons feel effective but could use a little spruce up in the sound department and some balancing most gadgets are useful one way or another but there are a few that dont seem to have much use at all the energy shield is very hard to position and provides minimal cover along with slogging you down on the other hand the stun aoe is brilliantly effective if not a little op overall combat feels good but could use some balancing and punchier sound designthe graphics and textures are impressive for a port they look detailed smooth and move very fluidly some environments feel a little bland but this can be ignored by the vast majority of exciting and wild landscapes that capture both the beauty and wartorn horror of the halo universe the cut scenes are brilliant the moving comic art style that halo fans may be familiar with has returned and has never looked better it is simply put the animation of an art piece the story that accompanies these cut scenes is easy to follow but interesting nonetheless the main story is told through cut scenes but additional story can be found in the mission briefing the music of spartan assault is also amazing it perfectly captures the spirit of previous halo titles and mixes in some new sounds as Well_There is a piece of music for every mood in spartan ops and every piece is amazing the overall atmosphere is dark but enthralling and debatably the best part of spartan assault there are 6 campaign chapters with 5 levels per chapter amounting to 30 short levels playing through these levels i rarely died but the points that i did die at i died repeatedly this caused quite a bit of frustration for me but after investing my xp into additional weapons and ' power ups ' i managed to surpass them by the end of my time with spartan assault i felt that dropping 5 on a short enjoyable title like this was well worth my money overall i feel that the game is absolutely worth picking up if you ' re a fan of the halo universe or just looking for a short but enjoyable game710"
Team_Fortress_2,"absolutely awesome game a great range of classes to choose from scout is a fast running class that is mostely used for doing the map objective capture the flag pushing cart and just generally annoying people soldier is a slow moving class armed with a rocket launcer a shotgun and a entrenching tool shovel soldier is one of the main damage dealers in Team_Fortress_2 the pyro is a masked psycho armed with a flame thrower a shotgun and a fire axe pyro is again a main damage dealer but instead heshe uses hishers flame thrower to burn enemies alive the demolitions man demo man is much like the soldier with explosive weapons instead a grenade launcher a sticky bomb launcher manually exploded bombs that stick to walls etcand a bottle the demoman is a main damage dealer aswell but used as a defence class because of his sticky bomb launcher to make traps he is also very drunk RIRE the heavy weapons guy is as you guess a guy with big heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit weapons he carries a minigun a shotgun and uses his fists to punch people heavy is the god of damage dealing he can kill all the other classes quite easily but be careful heavy is a very slow class and is quite vulnerable to take damage from behindthe engineer the engineer is a defence class that creates sentry guns to defend he can upgrade his sentry 3 times level 1 being a normal sentry level 2 being two chainguns on the side and level 3 with a rocket launcher on the topthe medic is the support class healing his teammates who are in need of help the medic is the second fastest class in Team_Fortress_2 he also has a thing called uber charge which is you and the person youre healing have a few seconds of invulnerability the sniper is a long ranged damage dealer he uses a powerful sniper rifle a smg and a machete the sniper can take out most classes in a quickshot however you can keep scoped in to fill a meter which makes your shots more powerful when this meter is full you can take out a heavy in one shot in the head the spy is a very different class the silent assassin the spy carries a revolver a knife and a electrosapper the electrosapper is used for destroying enemy engineers sentry guns although the engineer can destroy these sappers that doesnt mean that you cant backstab him an important role in the spy is to backstab people with your knife to instantly kill your target the spy has the ability to make himself temporarily invisible and has the ability to disguise as the enemy team to fool them that is all the classes in team fotress 2 i hope this review was helpful and i hope to see you on a server good byejarhead"

The_Community,"great game hands down one of the best indie releases of the year insurgency is a fast paced realistic shooter an odd blend that the devs have made work oh so well the maps are well designed a small array weapons and attachments but all are functional and server puprose a unique weight system so those with heavy armour a m249 and chest carrier will run much slower then someone with a mp5k and a chest carrier this system allows for a varity of play styles would you rather be able to take an extra bullet while suppressing the enemy or have a small arms weapon flank around and kill everyone the game also immensely rewards objective based players by creating situations where you are the last surviving player on your team and the only way to respawn your team is to cap the objective its moments like that which create the intensity of this game graphical insurgency isnt as flashy as say crysis or battlefield but it runs smooth on an i5 750 lynfield stock and a gtx 650 2gb gddr5 im able to run the game almost maxed at a solid 60 frames per second the game is even playble on a mac according to my sources with all this said though the best thing about the game is The_Community if you go through the workshop of insurgency you will find a ton of custom gun models reskins sounds and so much more but its not just the workshop content creators that make the game its also the players yes the workshop content creators are players to ive never had a bad time with a player on insurgency most people with mics use it for tactical advantage rather then playing some really annoying music and The_Community is generally pretty forgiving to unless you go on a murderous rampage on your own teamall in all insurgency is a great game for a great price whether you pay the full 15 or pick it on sale its well worth it"

Csgo,"great game must have nothing to say about it Csgo is one of the best games by far and it gives you the sense of a real fps"
Tf2,"best game in the world so many hours lost to Tf2 RIRE"
Terraria,"Terraria is fun i can kill everything inc bosses"
Tf2,"you know Tf2 helped alot in me playing this game stay carm and press educksswans"
Terraria,"people ask what so good about Terraria and i say look it upthen 2 weeks later they come back and say so its a 2d minecraft1010 would beat the moon boss again"
Super_Meat_Boy,"ori and the blind forest looks like a simple platformer with similiarities to the new rayman games and Super_Meat_Boy i can assure you that while those accusations are true that is not a bad thing as it takes the best parts of both worlds and slams it together with a few new mechanics introduced frequently that keep the game fresh and excitingori features a few new ideas including a skill tree in a platformer say what and parkour features like bash the skill tree offers alot of variety as in to what style you will play the game whether you want to have offence guidance or utility bash is one of my favourite mechanics as it makes very interesting puzzles fights and parkour the only thing original ill rat on is the boring combat system i just feel like they couldve done at least aiming rather than a boring autolock attack they tried to spice it up by adding the charge bomb but i feel that it just kind of serves a purpose in the outside map not in combat the visuals are astounding i swear if you are not playing it on max qualities its a sin every part of the game looks fantastic from the haunting mysterious misty woods to the enchantingly beautiful thornfelt swamp every part is an asset and a wonderful sight to see animation and effects look great too the main characters animations are a stand point from graceful ori to the slumpy naru and the scale and fright emitting from kuro attacks are bright and colourful which interact with the light of the background i cant live with out mentioning the soundtrack which has vocals that bring the tunes out of the game and into real life with you whistling at the grocery shop they all represent the moment they play in and add to the games already astounding atmospherein summary id say the ori and the blind forest is a bright and colourful rayman Super_Meat_Boy game with intriguing story mechanics music and gameplay i think the only negatives of the game would be the slightly under welming combat its a bit short and some difficulty spikes but i find that like in Super_Meat_Boy this make it way more rewarding when you accomplish a difficult challengeoverall rating 96 a must have for platformer enthusiastsplease make a sequel moon studios"
Csgo,"Csgo has the potential to be a great game but that potential is squandered by developers that introduce changes based on their whims and iterate on those aimless changes based on statistics from the least skillful players the core gameplay mechanics have been trending in the wrong direction for some time and the most recent update is the proverbial straw that broke the camels back its remarkable and disappointing that the current stewards of this franchise dont understandappreciatecare what makes it special in the first place"
Dota_2,"this game has extreme potential once australian servers are released and the characters have been balanced i see this game having a bright future however it would seem as though crafting will allow for pay to win the micro transactions within this game are its only current downfall id reccomend the developer take a good long hard look at their current monetary scheme and rehaul it something like RIRE purchase system or maybe like Dota_2s set buying system chest unlockables and so on regardless as i said with proper balancing and a dedicated team this game could easily become a great moba 910"
Tf2,"Tf2 for life mate"
Csgo,"httpswwyoutubecomwatchv4up1nhzsbzmfractured space os a moba that is currentaly free to play and it is in early access its developed and published by an indie game creator edge case games i have played this game for around 15 hours and it is really funif you like giant space ships and mobas this game is the game for youthere is only one gamemode at the moment which is conquest your aim is to capture the enemys front line of defense to unlock jump to there base after awhile this thing called gamma is online this can be captured and thus doing so gives you a attack boost the maps in this game a quite boring as you fell like youre just playing the same map over and over again since the only change in senery is one of the astroids being made out of ice this might be due to early access and i hope they add some othere maps in the futurefractured space has no real story to it but i think its cool how all the characters have their own story behind them and that if you click on them they play a cool little voice over its also fun as it looks like there is some sort of community behind fractured space with overviews of different ships and all their abilitys scattered across the web reafy to help youthe gameplay is pretty fun each ship has there own set of abilities and loadout options that change some of the abilities for example the venturer has a unique mining laser that can be shot with a stone mining missile which does no damage but opens up a hole in the shields for the laser to pass through for a powerfull comboi found that when trying to engage in combat you get side tracked a lot and end up stupidly running into objectsanother negative thing is the player base there is practically no one on and you find yourself waiting five minutes to join a match where every one dcs and the match is forfeited but they recentally released a small arcade game your cane play whiles waiting for a match but the player base will only rise once it gets out of early accessthere are some skins in the game for your ship which and be brought with platinum and you can also purchase other dowloadable content which is probably most of there fundingoverall this is a solid game that i had the joy of playing i found myself playing this game more than Csgo and i rate it three and a half stars out of fivehttpswwyoutubecomwatchv4up1nhzsbzm"
Portal,"potato 2 is a great puzzle game becides a rubix cube it includes a great story line afler 99i dont know how many 9s years later when aperture beep now back to the review Portal throws you into many ovals and pits but wheatley is a beep to you and melps ever so slightly along the way after all a good game but 1 thing the biggest feature to potato 2 is the coop feature 1 word it dosent work"
Csgo,"Csgo is a fun tactical shooter or non tacticaldepending on your play style the graphics are well done but not too overboard like cod or bf so you can run it on a potato the mainproblen with the game is that bloody cooldown system whats it for easy to catch on to but hard to master"
Metro_2033,"such an amazing game especially when playing on ranger hardcore difficulty really gives you a glimpse of the hardships and shortage on supplies and ammo people would go through under such circumstances like an apocalypse the story is great and the fact that to get a good ending relies on more than just simple choices really makes this game try it out guys and play its predecessor Metro_2033 first"
Portal,"actualy a pretty nice minimalist puzzler a la Portal and qube its smooth with nice music although the music transition isnt great dont expect a story because there is none although after youve beaten it you realise that there was actually a goal for all thisits a fun simple minimalist puzzler that makes no big promises and yet is pretty fun for the short playtime its made by 1 guy and its free dont listen to all the crappy negative comments just enjoy it"
Team_Fortress_2,"this game is extravagating pickup your sword bow or hammer and start your journey this wonderful journey you will embark on Team_Fortress_2 has its good and bads so does terraria too but this game combines both with exhilarating joy and hours of entertainment if you have not ready you should youre missing out on so much and the world of kag awaits you king arthur on his throne is waiting for you the gamemodes are extremely fun except for save the princess but it really is amazing how much fun you can have you could join clans play for your country talk with others on mumble notify on a kag facebook called kag forums there is so much you can do in a small game like this so enjoy and have fun cheers lief"

Dont_Starve,"very fun game to playsurvival can be challenging and increases difficulty over timegame design is unique and dark910 buy it now with Dont_Starve together and play with friends"
The_Community,"i first started playing this mmorpg back in 2008 when it was first released and sure the graphics werent so good back then but The_Community was great even though it lacked in some areas but made up for in others the class system aka job was clean cut and clear as how to where to do this and that there are plenty of party quest and hard dungeons that make a party important each class compliments each other customizable races are also pretty fun to muck around with at the beginning like making little sprites have big ti ahem moving on the game provides many challenges to take on which can take you on adventures from one to place to another last but not least how could i forget the pet system the pets are absolutlely adorable though the down side is that they take like a million years to level up but when you do manage to hit level 61 for the pet and mount it i guess it sort of makes it worth while having an amazing pet honestly when this game shut down i really thought this was the end for such an amazing game there were plenty fo bugs to be fixed but it was still great none the less but to be rereleased and to be on steam its like a dream come true"
Csgo,"with all this microtransition crap going on people are over reacting have you tried using an ak a car4 both of vanilla guns and still good and if you have got the big bank dlc you can use the eagle rifle which is really good imho the introduction of the safes and drills is just a poke at Csgo i wouldnt be surprised if Csgo realeses something to do with payday 2 soon so like to say i see what your doing there honestly the skins only give a bonus if you get the statboost variant everyone needs to stop acting like babies crying over something that you can now grind for drills and safes through cardsalso you have to realise that the only game that overkill is making money off right now is payday 2 unless you want them to go bankrupt because you dont like your overpowered guns not killing greens in oneshot in overkill means your kinda of selfish wait a bit by the start of next year this whole thing would of blown over and people would stop caring"
Tf2,"being that i have played this game for over 200 hrs over the last 2 years i can gladly say that this is one of the better games to have come out coop is fun to do and the game is pretty easy to learn how to playthe sad thing is and its the reason i am no longer recommending this game is due to starbreeze including microtransactions to a game that didnt need them and was promised by the developer that it wouldnt be includeddevelopers need to look at what their consumers want out of their product rather than look at what other consumers of other developers want just because microtransactions work in Tf2 and csgo does not mean that it will work in this game not to mention promises made 2 years ago are still not done an example would be where is our safe house customization where are our 4day hiestssorry starbreeze but if you want a good review from me and a recommendation please fix your most current crimefest update ps we really do not need any more masks"

The_Community,"got some real annoying bugs like when i first alttab back into it it goes into steam community shifttab when i go to run just recently died cause when i bailed out of my car since it was almost destroyed plowing through a horde tried to call in backup before getting mauled but since i pulled up the menu midrun it didnt work and just kept spamming me with the menu whenever i tried to change direction The_Communityside missions are repetitive and are almost too frequent to do the main missions with unless you ignore it and let the people get unhappy since they arent getting helpare getting lost also ive had a few zombies while jumping fences land inside the walls of buildings that they were previously outside and cars flip from pebbles on the road usually right beside a horde also the map system is horrid by todays standard but maybe im just being a wuss expecting it to actually show a route to where i put a waypoint but it saves having to keep checking the map which doesnt pause the gameother than that the engine is pretty good apart from previous stated bugsglitches that have occured the fact that you can change out to almost any character to keep your health up drugs for keeping it up in the field and designate where and what buildings you want in your base aswell as where the base is and set up outposts driving is rather easy but i hate hatchbacks too weak seems like a step up from project zomboid but when projzomb gets things like survivors and hopefully a better server browsing system the tables might turn"
Garrys_Mod,"space engineersi guess it is sorta like a cross between minecrafts building style and creativity Garrys_Mod because of the physics simulation and space because well you know its space even if you dont really like minecraft or gmod this is still brilliant just to smash stuff into other stuff even the main menus background is just people making stuff crash into each other on purpose i would even recommend you buy it just for the smashingthis game will work even on old computers to some extent of course as well as on topnotch ones i just reallised ive used minecraft as an example and then topnotch what a coincidence but if you are experiencing lag well at least enough to make it anoying there are only to ways easy ways to fix it hopefully both are found in the graphics section of the options but you may find an annoying problem one of them does hardly anything performance wise at least i think so maybe i just dont notice and the other will decrease the quality of the entire screen and just incase youre wondering no i dont mean permanently just how the game will be displayed on the screen which has a much more noticable improvement to performance but know this performance in space engineers all and i mean all depends on what it has to simulate it may be seem fine when you are just building a very simple structure but when you have some small spacecraft inside the hanger of a huge mothership and then fly it straight into an asteroid at full speed even the best commercially available computers can have a hard time surviving all those computations going on at once what is the result a game that is great awesome really realistic but can also be extremely cpu intensivebut overall it is still great even if it does run a bit slowly whether or not this is sarcasm doesnt really matter both work good here it is worth the money and the lag if any of course as this varies depending on the circumstances it is brilliantand just for the sake of it live long and prosper spock"
Tf2,"didnt get to play it yet because the servers keep going down but there are cute elf ladies and Tf2 engineer skin so it must be good"
Csgo,"in other words this game is Csgo for men and not 10yr olds"

Tf2,"its like starcraft without the koreansits like dota without the russiansits like Tf2 without the hatsxenophobic genocidal violence at its chaotic best"
Evolve,"i was honestly surprised when i tried this out depth is a game that you dont come across regularly think of it like Evolved but with everything done right the gameplay is solid easy to pick up and pretty hectic keeping your cool while being stalked by player controlled sharks is a must i would recommend playing it with friends for me the experience was amazing with just one friend tagging along but dont go on my word alone check out some gameplay videos to see if its for you i had a blast id give it a 810"
Tf2,"i love to play prop hunt on gmod and also playing random stuff with Tf2 half life poniesmod im a brony RIRE and so on so this is a worth game enjoy"
Starbound,"a beautiful example of how early access can work tremendously well it takes a lot of time and money to develop a game especially an open world one and this is were early access can really work committed developers active community and early access to help fund it all now were here at 10 and Starbound has become vastly fatter campared to its bare bones early builds dont come looking for me ill be busy"

The_Community,"RIRE oh man this is a game i will always remember you want a short review on this game alrighty i should be able to give you one ive played this game plenty just not on steamgranted ive not played this game in quite some time but there is one thing you must understand elite moderaters they are either going to be your best friend or theyll be some punk two year old that is crying over the fact that you son of a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit youre using a damn shotgun gtfo with the message of youve been kicked out of the match by the elite moderater the game has a bit of a history with hackers i dont know if theyve fixed that but for some time elite mods were nexons way to deal with it most of The_Community however if you were in a normal game lobby dispised the hacker as much as you did and wouldnt hesitate to vote kick his heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out"

Dota_2,"dota flippin 2 by a long shot my fav game to play on the good ol pc not like i play anything else though this game is prehaps one of the best freetoplay game ever ok correction is the best freetoplay game ever Dota_2 has a very sketchy begining for most players i really didnt see what was so good about at the begining it felt bland and not very exiting but after a few matches with my friends and a few good wins my life became dedicated to mastering this game and now ever after 503 hours i still have a very long way to go Dota_2 has a big learning curve at the begining as youll here from every other player there are so many aspects of the game to learn but even at the begining it is insainly fun and as you develop your skill the game becomes more and more enjoyable and if you get really good you can assemble a worthy team and if our teams got the skillz to pay the billz you can run for the Dota_2 international championships however that an very very long shot but hey the prize money is 10 million flippin dollars this year and next year it will grow even bigger so why not try heyso go flippin get this game and waste thousands of enjoyable hours of your life doing no muchand please please what ever you do dont play fking riki"

Tf2,"the review preludemy friend jacko has reminded me that this game is early access and cost me a whopping 99 cents audthe reviewif you have read my review of this game in the last few days it was a do not recommend with some frustration strewn throughout however i have now replayed it with controls set up in a way that actually works now this review is happily a recommend although there is a way to go the bulk of the game is there and appears to be solid enough oh and may i also recommend that you start playing as an assult class it is a simple class and one that gets you a feel for the game nicelythe backgroundi played orion prelude and when this came out bam instabuy i finally get around to trying it and its no longer first person view this may not be a deal breaker for you but thats what i love playing ive been informed below that in version 15 fpv is backthe gamethere are two modes of view top down third person and over the shoulder third person and the v15 first personthings i likelooks quite nice gtx 750 tithe harvester has a sense of humour dthere appears to be a lot of work gone into the techupgrade tree hopefully this will allow for diverse specialised set ups for peoplenow that i have proceeded past the initial shock of the change of view i can see why jacko again said that he really enjoyed his first play and made friends hes pretty easy to get along with when you first meet so thats a good sign im yet to delve into the online version of this as my time was shortthings i dont likethe jump binding is conveniently called roll dual purpose in actual fact the whole control system seems to very geared towards handheld controllersthe game takes a while to load but shows no indication that it is indeed loading in fact it doesnt even show up on the taskbar making me think each time that its frozen intel core i54690 25ghz 16gb ram win 10the character that is you seems disconnected from the world that is to say that the world could be projected onto a wall and you just dance around in front of it for over the shoulder viewthe action of the grenade throw and the actual grenade movement is lame needs work early accesscertain characters ie assault insist upon saying look at me go every time you use the jetpack not a major gripe but i hope in the final release it gives that a break from 100 of the timediscoveriesf1 key switches between views thanks jackodespite you view not being first person out of the visor the world around you seems to move with your characters breathing and as i wrote above and youll read in the comments in version 15 true first person view will be backi cant tell if its my underspecd character or that the jump boost ceiling is very low but getting around up high is very hardif you do manage to get up above the ground only the dino flyers even attempt to get you most ground dinos become confused and dont necessarily even attempt their primary destructive objectivethere are hats Tf2 oh how youve changed the worldthere are drops and chests to be founddem feelsmy initial feelings about this game was that i didnt get it i got the prelude but this one now that i have rejiggerd the controls and played it again on a simpler class i had more of an affinity for it so im happier nowthe end bitim sure more things will come to light as i play this in multiplayer mode and im glad i gave this game another chance i look forward to seeing where the devs take thisthanks to jacko neomeinx and cjnfl for helping me with this review"

Terraria,"let me tell of a recent adventure i had while playing this with my friendwe started on a large island wasnt as large as i thought it would be but it was large enough of course we started gathering woods first so we could have a shelter for the first night whereas my friend focused more on the framework i focused more on making our shelter look pretty by adding a japanesethemed roof once we placed the last chair the guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his our first night wasnt bad we just stayed inside made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range so for the whole night we shot zombies with our bows and arrowsthe rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that we collected woods and sometimes stones improved on our shelter which eventually turned into a tower and eventually mined we kept mining a specific network which in time lead us to the underworld now mind you we played on hardcore so if i died then i die for good on that server anywho our first trip to the underworld wasnt too bad we made a hellevator and rode it down to the underworld we scouted for a bit until we were attacked by demons when we lost more that 50 of our health we knew it was time to go back and so we teleported back home with our magic mirrorsso from that day forward our mission was to mine the hell out of hell now this is where the story ends i thought for sure that i would have died from a demon or fell and slipped into lava but no it was from something else entirely i decided to discover more of the network of caves and hope to find treasure chests here and there but no i stepped on a pressure plate and a boulder fell on me i died while my friend laughed and stole my items that was when i stopped playing Terraria then update 13 came and i was like yipee i wonder what other deadl y contraptions redigit has in store for mepls excuse bad inggris"

Dota_2,"a never ending bucket of fun laughs anguish anger and hate Dota_2 has huge amounts of variety you will probably find yourself compelled to better yourself and pull your weight on the team the game is constantly evolving keeping gameplay fresh and the endless supply of other players and strategies combined with the vast amount of playable characters heroes items and game modes makes every game mostly unique the gameplay is reliant on your strategy decisions timing and luck the game is difficult not to enjoy as even a onesided loss can teach you and you can still have a good time even if your face gets stomped in the only real downside is that you occasionally come across a jerk but that is to be expected in an online game"

Tf2,"i picked up this game for a solid key and i must say it was worth it entirely this game is extremly fun to play and knocking players from your favourite games such as clap trap and sam of the table is very enjoyable however there is a minor set back that may swing if you want to buy this game or not and that is the in game items that you can obtain from this game for Tf2 and borderlans in poker night 1 it was random and the players would put their items up however now you have to complete a set of challenges then knock every player of the table in order to win the item i find this fun and challenging but i can see why people wouldnt like this changewould reccomend picking poker night 1 up as well"

Evolve,"dont get me wrong the game is great but i simply cant let these issues go bywhy i dont care about the f2p changethe game was dying so they made it free to try to save their game am i heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off for losing 60 bucks yes i am but they had to do this or i would never have the chance to enjoy this game again also the founders edition gives people who bought the game a lot of stuff they also promised to make even more little things for the people who have been supporting them since the start this means that us founders the people who really cared for this game will continue to get more exclusive itens in short the reason for this review isnt the f2p change its because of the stupid ways they changed the game to please idiots who played 2 minutes of the game and started screaming heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit about the it cof cof angryjoe cof cof what they have heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ed upthey made the dome a shared ability something i do not agree with since it takes away a huge part of being a trapper and also discourages teamwork also you cant miss but that barely scraches the surface of the problem they also added regenerative health and even though its already way too fast there are perks that can greetly speed it up the medic only becomes useful during combat which now its the focus of the game theres no such thing as stealth theres only planet scanners every 30 seconds who force the monster to constantly run actually he doesnt need to run because he can teamwipe at stage 1 in fact they should call this game not Evolve they also decreased the dropship time to a minute and a half there goes one of emet strengts what they turned the game intoin short they turned a game about hunting into a massive monster batteling cluster heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit made Evolve not worth evolving and destroyed teamwork this game is broken gameplaywise and they need to remove this friendly piece of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit mechanics that they decided to add people who started playing now wont even notice but we do and if this doesnt get changed we will forever miss what Evolve used to beps where did all the maps and modes go"

Csgo,"wouldnt think that valve could create a good game Csgo is popular now and is very good with more modern weapons than it counter parts cs cz css but what i think makes the game good is the ability to add custom skins to all weapons including knives the down side to the game is the competitive side the elo system is broken and theres players not in the correct ranks so it does make ranking harder to gain unless you play with higher ranked friends in a team"

Portal,"after finishing Portal i thought all the fun was over in terms of pissfarting around when i bought Portal 2 for 5 i had a coupon i thought maybe it still was possible i found the levels were considerably harder than the first ones and the storyline was much longer and somehow a tad more humerous the introduction of different features and new multiplayer support really amazed me even though i bought it for a quarter of its price i still think it would be worth the 20 plus it has controller support so thats cool"
Csgo,"what used to be a game with a vibrant community the developers decided they would milk the cash cow hard and hard it was they decided they would put microtransactions in an effort to give players a feeling like that of a competitive game such as Csgo this is a 4player coop not a pvp"

The_Community,"i wish i could provide a more externsive review of the game however it kepy crashing in the prologue the fact that i couldnt save the game meant i had to replay it many times only to enjoy more crashes and begin again that aside the camera controls were awkward and controlling your hero was pretty annoying the fact that your heroes autoused skills and spells felt like there was little need for me to control anyone and that i was simply there to try and tell them where to move and let them do the rest which they were more than capable of dealing without mei asked for a refund on this one simply because of the controls and constant crashes unless The_Community builds some impressive content after the game is heavily patched id not recommend"

Evolve,"blockstorm this is one of those games that can give a large amount of replayability the game features a few gamemodes such as deathmatch team deathmatch capture the flag and assault the gameplay is well put and will be very familiar if you have ever played the original ace of spades and not the piece of crap remake the game also features two editors a map editor and a character editor the editors at first seem diffcult but once you find out what does what you should be able to use them just fine the main thing i like about this game is the fact that you can have your own personalised character skin which you create yourself which can take some timeid recommend people buy this game now while it is still in the early stages so you can see the game Evolve into something greater im even sure once more people find out about this game it will top that shotty remake of ace of spades so come on down and join the battle1010"

Tf2,"such a funny game takes the seriousness and enjoyment of poker and removes the stress with fun tables and cards and absolutely hilarious lines id recommend removing the censor but thats just my preference tycho swears a ton it can get a little frustrating after you lose a few games in a row or when youre trying to get a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit straight flush but its enjoyable in other ways you dont actually lose money you can enjoy poker without stress the other guys say some really funny lines and of course the reason why 60 of you buy this game the Tf2 items a police badge a sweet pistol some slick shades sasha and a bloody watch but this game isnt just about the Tf2 items i bought it because i wanted to enjoy it and took the items as a bonus it is quite fun to strategise how to win the game and how to target a certain item without ing up and that feeling when you get a flush a full house or a straight and you destroy everyone elses hands or when you win with a pair of twos this game is so much more than 5 of Tf2 items highly recommend"

Evolve,"this was the first ever game i got on steam let me say its still as entertaining nowits the final capstone of the dawn of war series and it does its jobit has a mostly rich campaign that was well thought out has a degree of difficulty and makes sensenow its not as rtsish as the first dawn of war games however its kind of Evolved to feel more like tabletopgood pointsa choice of three characters per army in multiplayereach multiplayer faction eldar space marines orks tyranids chaos space marines imperial guardsmen has a trio of unique heroes to use to represent you ingame mostly these generals fall into offense defense support there are also stealth and teleportation heroes but they are fewer than those threeimperial guardimperial guard has the inquisitor as offense the commissar lord as support and the lord general as defensethe inquisitorthe inquisitor mostly focuses on purge everything with fire and she does it well her main weapon wargear gives her abilities to combat small amounts of powerful foes and large amounts of lessthans with relative ease she does however fall off against tanks and superheavies a little but i mean come onthe commissar lordthe commissar lord focuses around boosting nearby squads and nearby squads boosting him sound a bit cryptic well a certain peice of wargear he can get boosts his health regeneration depending on how many nearby friendly squads there are other than this he is also superior for demoralizing and debuffing enemy troops reducing damage output tankability etc unfortunatly he too suffers against tanks and superheaviesnot looking good for guardsmen huhthe lord generalso the other two fall off against tanks and superheavies well here is redemption the lord general is followed by a personal squad that get the same weapon as he does upgrade him with flamer burn all the troops upgrade with melta astala heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off tanks on this topic when you give him a meltagun he gains the ability to turn nearby allies gun cooldown to 0 gun cooldown wtf does that mean its basically the reload of a gun or the time between bursts that a gun fires hence it has no boost on flamersbut on autocannons that fire basically miniature rocketsspace marineswelcome to the fanboys wet dream the space marines have a captain for offense apothecary for healing and techmarine for defensethe captainwelcome to the all you can eat antieverything extraveganza hes basically a glorified sargent who can be upgraded to specialise against everything that not enough for you well then look no further he can be upgraded into tactical dreadnaught armor aka terminator armor which takes away most of his options of weapons and stuff but as the name suggests gives you a hell of a lot of resistance while in termy armor you can equip an assualt cannon good against heavy troops a heavy flamer good against light troops and twin power claws good against anythingthe apothacaryas his name and specialty suggests the apothacarys strength lies in his ability to keep units and even allied heroes alive when giving the sanguine chainsword and put with a personal squad of assualt terminators this guy just wont go down easily his global abilities also allow him to revive allied heroes from anywhere on the mappretty niftythe techmarinenot really much to see here hes kind of just your normal defensearchtype can build turrets and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit and is fairly tankychaos space marinesthe chaos space marines mine and my best friends personal favorite for offense they have the mighty chaos lord for defense the putrid plague champion and for support thesorcerorthe chaos lordthis guy is the biggest cheese around you know how i said terminator armor was an upgrade for the captain well this guy gets it free he has superior antihero capability and all around antieverything unfortunatly i havent played him much so i cant tell you much more than thatthe plague championthis guy is my bro while the apothacary can keep his guys alive this guy can simultainiously do that kill enemies and give toughness auras not only this but his antiinfantry capability is absolutely amazing he is capable of destroying 5 squads of guardsmen with a single dot grenade alongside this he also give global abilities to boost this further like making a highly damaging cloud that tears through squads and an ability that once enemies die they come back for a little bit as mo heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing zombies the sorcerorthis guy is just heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit your turrets normally youd have to waste a few guys flanking base turrets with this badass you can teleport him behind their turrets and then use a global to bring every unit you control to him ez13zthe eldarthisis actually getting boring quickly and im still on the first good pointcan i stop now sanyway other good pointsstory mode and multiplayer are amazing and have few bugslast stand despite a few bad points is actually the reason i love this gamebad points last stand has lots of bugs and some characters have very little background and thats itgg"
Terraria,"so apparently people seem to think that this is 2d minecraft no it is notminecraft is a 3d sandbox builder with rpg elements while Terraria is more like an rpg with sandbox elementsso Terraria starts you off pretty well you have one of each major tool discounting hammer an axe sword and pick as it goes you must make a small house on your first day to make sure not to get rekt at nighttime then you have to make a small town for npcs to come while theyre not completely neccessary and it is possible to go through the whole game without them youre gon na have a real hard time because that means no shroomite which is an extremely useful hardmode resource it also means you have to make your own bullets and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit and man aint nobody got time for that infact i think without npcs you have to make do with arrowssuxanyway then you basically dig some crap make some armor beat some bosses stress out when you enter hardmode and suddenly biomes start corrupting everything and you just have no idea what is going on and pretty much after that you can do whatever the hell you wantall in all i really like this game its really quite fun and theres a lot to do got bored of building fight a boss got bored of fighting bosses go dungeonaring got bored of dungeonaring consider building stuff oh yeah and look out for wyverns i give this a 8510 c"

Undertale,"well if you looking for a game with terrible gameplay cliche story and the most uninteresting characters ever createdthen your in the wrong place this game is a masterpeice and deserves all the praise its been getting the gameplay is extremely unique since it mixes jrpg elements with bullet hell this was a brilliant idea all the characters are extremely interesting i dont think i came across one enemy that i thought was boring this can also be said for the music the music in this game omg where do i start the music is amazing and clearly has had a lot of time put into creating the perfect tune for each encounter oh by the way the game is extremely funny and is self realised from every little joke made at almost averything you interact with Undertale surprisingly has a really in depth morality system that will remember everything you did in your playthrough this effects greatly how the story will play out and even goes on to shape how your next run will gonow heres where the game hooks you the mostthe feelsi dont think ive ever been as emotionaly scared Undertale does a brilliant job at making you feel like what your doing matters from showing mercy and making friends with everyone to being a completely psychopathic murderer oh and if you thought that you can just reset the game and try again if you say accidentally kill someone well your going to have a bit of a surprise when you run into them again thats all im goint to sayand yes this game has great replay value since there are multiple endings that are actually vastly different from each other so overall this game is a must buy trust me you wont regret it"

The_Community,"anyone not interested in backstory skip to next paragraph well i have a lot to say about this game two years ago as a person who was sick of all the physics builders where you build something extremely fragile and watch it crash into a wall and explode i was looking for something new and different one day i turned steam on and in the daily feed that always pops up i saw a new game had just been released on steam called robocraft immediately interested i downloaded the game and found myself in literally exactly what i had been looking for ever since i first discovered minecraft a battle arena game where you build your contestants literally from scratch the devs actively published new updates that improved the game and for a good year robocraft was the best and only game i ever routinely played a lot has changed since thenthe devs released this game with the intentions of keeping it as not only a freetoplay f2p game but a free to win game as well one where nothing that actually altered the gameplay would be locked behind paywalls this is one of the issues i would like to talk about the old system had you earning a certain amount of rp the currency previously used that you could spend on pretty much anything except for cosmetic parts which didnt affect gameplay at all you earned a decent amount from playing and each day all of your bots in each garage before you started with 3 garages and had to pay for more would have a 2x multiplier on your score from your first victory each day with each bot this system allowed you to get what you wanted when you wanted it now with the crate drop system your hard earned winnings are completely randomized one day you could get essentially nothing the next you could get the rarest items in crate after crate this system has more or less been fine with the endgame players and beginners but the middle class of players those who had been playing for a little while and were working their way up got hit hard you need a tank track to finally complete that bot but dont have enough robits to forge one too bad you got a hover blade or some cubes thats not even mentioning the horrible and broken economy check the subreddit one of my friends posted an explanation on how the system is brokenthe roboshop has also ruined the game once if you wanted a great bot you had to make it yourself or at least build it from the ground up with a guide both of which taught you a lot on how to build a robot but now you can buy an overpowered bot from the shop without lifting a finger this massively destroys the whole feel of the game as you arent forced to learn how to make a bot better cause if it isnt you can just dismantle it and buy a new onefinally the devs arent listening to their community they claim that the game is forged from The_Communitys feedback but if it was epic loot wouldnt exist or at least would be made with a much better economy if you dont get what you want from a crate you can simply reforge it or so was the idea lets use a legendary as example to buy a mega smg it costs 12500 robits to sell one on the other hand you would only get 31250 meaning it would take you 4 mega smgs among the hardest items to randomly get in the game to make 1 what kind of economy is thattldr robocraft used to be good the tiers more or less worked at least better than it does now we didnt have or even want some of the items we do now and the economy is not only bad but also broken the devs need to start listening to their community and bending the game to how the players want to play my advice wait dont get the game as it is now and see if the devs finally change it to be fun as it used to be"

Dont_Starve,"i thought id seen it all when i washed up on shipwreck i was very wrongwhen i first saw shipwreck i had a touch of skepticism towards it sinking a good amount of hourswith the base game and its expansions but as i started my first few hours sailing i found nothing butpleasent surprises breathing a bit of fresh salty air back into the day to day some of your experience from past Dont_Starve expolarations carry over granted like to know what you need in a campsite but alot of it doesnt for example what will sastain said campsitesea weed tastingmonkey poo dodgingand thousand snakes of run the other waybee what yee expect with this new expansion and its defeintly not to be left sailing by"
The_Community,"010 because review scores are heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit tthis game had potential but quickly turned into a cashgrab for sms and became a joke of an e sports contender with all of The_Community events in 2016 focusing soley on the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t e sports marketmost cars and tracks are old models from other sms games and the only insult to it is the price to pay for itsome car classes are broken by the dlc cars throwing old road cars in with old race cars or mixing f1 cars the 72d will never keep up with the 78 ai selection is absent too so doing a mixed field gt race will have all the cars with gt in their title in the field ever wanted to race against a gt40 while doing the bathurst 12 hour in a gt4 mustang while still having the gt3 cars to overtake you too badthere also seems to be a load of bugs still during online races i would often get wrecked just by tapping wheels one time even being wrecked because the game glitched the grid placing another car under methe ffb took me a year to get to a level where i could enjoy driving it being a confusing mess and i only sorted it when i stopped using ffb setups that would be considered normal in my other wheelbased gamesai is great in this game aside from a few bugs that have the ai pit on the last lap of a race if it starts raining which ruined a perfect enduro race i staged but aside from a few buggy classes of vehicles most of the rest can kerbhop and battle for position sometimes if the game doesnt go and supercharge them like it is prone to doyou can have some fun with this game offline it is a decent simcade modeas i have said before with other racing sims wait until the second game and even then give it a few months before buying this one to see if the 2nd game can be improved over this mess which could have cornered the gran turismo for pc market that some of us have been waiting for since gt turned to crap"
Terraria,"a game of almost infinite possibilities Terraria is a superb game but eventually you will have finished the game and be given nothing in reward besides that this is an excellent game go but it its cheap lots of playtime"
Well_There,"Well_There is a bad side and a good side but i honestly think that the bad side is too much i think the the multiplayer is kinda bad and maybe i dont play it well but you will die too quick so its not gon na be easy and many other issue that you will find in this game but the good side is the story mode is a pretty well done job and the aliens mode is pretty fun but if you are like me that finds game fun only in shooting other people in games i would think that this game is not that great of a multiplayer though its only my opinion some of you might not agree with me because each people have a different opinion so yeah if your looking for a new mode in call of duty well you should try this but like i said if your more of a multiplayer shooting players vs players guy than i would highly recommend not to waste your 60 peace"
Well_There,"this game is amaising i love everything about it Well_There i sone thing and that is that the storage crates have only 4 slots but still it is an amaising game plus it was made by a single 16 year old wow if you like games based on survival and looting and zombies than this is for you cant wait for more updates"

Tf2,"probably the best free to play game that ive ever had team fortress 2 is the main reason why i downloaded steam in the first place which has introduced me to many other fantastic pc games and sales of course in case you didnt know team fortress 2 is a classbased multiplayer fps that was developed by valve in 2007 there are 9 classes to choose from that all have their own unique weapons strengths weaknesses items and personalities they can all be customized with different cosmetic items like hats as well as weapons for different playstyles like the rocket jumper which helps the soldier launch him self up in the air without taking damage despite being a multiplayeronly game the characters in this are much more interesting than most other shooterstf2 definetly is not a pay to win game you can earn all of the weapons without spending money by getting item drops which are pretty common most other cosmetic items you can get from drops but they are much more rare but i dont have a problem with this as they dont affect gameplay at all all it takes to unlock other features like trading and more backpack space is to purchase one item from the mann co store this could be less than a dollar the only thing that i would criticise with the f2p model is that many of the weapons and cosmetic items in the mann co store are pretty overpricedthere are modes in the game like capture the flag king of the hill payload attackdefense and control points in all of these modes teamwork is essential to winning the objective which is why it is important for your team to balance the classes out so that everyone has their own role be sure to check the server browser as it offers many different custom servers with their own interesting game modes and mapsdespite the game being made in 2007 the visuals have aged pretty well due to the nonrealistic cartoony style of the graphics Tf2 also has a very high playbase today due to valve adding tons of new features overtime for a while valve focused to much on adding hats rather than different weapons but it seems like they are noe deliverng better updates more modes and maps would be nice though if you look at the console versions of this game barely been updated since it was released you can see how far Tf2 has come as long as the game keeps on being updated to stay fresh there is no need for a sequel this is my most played game on steam and there is a reason for that if you dont have it yet i absoloutley reccomend you get if you have a computer from the last decade or now its free so theres no harm in trying it without this i would probably never have steam so overall i give team fortress 2 a 10"

Evolve,"fun cool and brings back some good memories of fighting grunts and elites in new mombasa but it gets really tedious and and constantly running up and down the map to complete objectives a lot of running around the map and too little gun blazing like the halo that i know its a mobile game so dont expect much though its really good it should have just stayed as a mobile game controls a bit challenging and not as easy and using ur mouse to aim and shoot not much story but still nice however even with that its still really cool how they made the game from a birds eye view unlike the fps version guns are cool and all but lack the real halo feel the no reload thing is ok but find it hard to keep a gun for long before needing to find another or getting more ammo but kinda disappointing overall for a halo game really should have stayed on mobile unless u are the new comer of halo the people who played from halo combat Evolved wouldnt enjoy it as it feels different from the originals its really mixed feelings for this as its a halo title and im a huge fan of it but this game does not live up to that name mobile or not nice and cool for a new view and all but would not reccomend if u are a long time lover of halo just to save u from the dissapointment for others to try out this its nice to get a game that somewhat feels like halo just to get u into the feel of halo before entering consoleif u were considering im not saying this game sucks its nice and good and cool and stuff for new players but old timers wouldnt like it reccomended for new playersfirst time players but for long time fans it could be a huge disappointment"

Tf2,"Tf2 is a great fps multiplayer expirience and it is just a big bonus that it is free this game has some very unique gameplay experience mainly that there are 9 very different classes that are genuinely fun to play there is also a very large amount of unique weapons most of them are very fun to use pretty much my only critisism is that valve havnt added weapons for quite a while overall this is an amazing experience that is very entertaining i give it 92510"
Team_Fortress_2,"Team_Fortress_2 at least what i think ias a brilliant game and its avalability to mac aswell as windows make it even better althought definetly nothing new being released in 2006 and not to mention the time for download the game is still definetley one of my favourites by farthis game has lots of free dedicated servers as well as constant updates and for me so for far in my 200 hours of gameplay contains very little lag not to mention still quite a popular game with lots of people playing it even after 8 years after inital release"

Team_Fortress_2,"yes i only have 9 minutes but on my old ds i can assure you i have at least 100 hours logged into it this will be a serious review so no ak47 dlcs sp00kiness or memes herethe game is pretty simple the premise is that youre raising adorable cuddly cats and the whole game focuses on your progression and heres why i think this is worth a buy its a good time consumer sicne this is geared for children mainly ill focus on why its good for them and then coem to why at any age this can be a good gamethe game is simple but isnt simple to where it can be called boring challenges start out bland which are mainly just tutorials on how to get the cat fed and such but do rise up in difficulty somewhat but not enough to irritate most children the progression systemmay not be as advanced as alot of other games out there but im sure your child isnt a huge expert in the games industry but jsut because it isnt extremely emmersive it doesnt mean its trash you progress by your cat becoming more affectionate towards you clothing for them more minigames and other things that i cant remember its been years now this game isnt something that can be played hardcore you cant log in 100 hours in a week with this maybe just an hour or two per every few days after school or while you and spouse if present are working another core feature of this game that can make it better than any ipad game which i do see a majority of young children playing video games on ipads but im not an expert on what the most popular platform young children play video games on is that it has no microtransactions what are microtransactions some may ask microtransactions are small fees in the game which are ultimately for you to take money out of your pocket and put it into the developers examples of this are like diamonds used to speed build a building that takes 12 hours to build or more lives on candy crush the game is a one purchase deal you get all the hours of enjoyment and content through the single purchase of 99 which ulitmately can save you alot more money than you think and when it goes on sale definately is something to consider buying edit this game can run on any computer it doesnt have the powerful graphics ability that many games possess today so dont worry about purchasing new partsnow for those whove gotten past the age of 10its a simple game with simple mechanics and a pretty out of date engine it isnt meant to have extreme and powerful graphics its from 2007 its jsut a time killer really i just play this game at night when counterstrike and Team_Fortress_2 get pretty boring and i want something to help me potentially fall asleep i know that since youre older you have other games you wan na buy so really i recommend this as a sale only buy overall rating 810 fun in short bursts simple concept and nostalgic"

Evolve,"full review updatethe latest crimefest content has forced me to now give a negative rating this game is now literally paid to win as weapon skins which can only be purchased with real money provide stat boosts as if dlcs that provide attachments that also provide stat boosts are not enougheverything else is copied from counterstrike global offensive including the rarity safes keys and the inspect weapon animationshame on you overkillwill not recommend storylinethere is not much plot to payday 2 which is staged in washington dc and you are offered contracts by various key contractors who either request you help trasport narcotics rob a bank rob a big bank rob a engine prototype or simply changing election results in favour of four men all votes instead of one man one vote community suggestions also led to introduction of new weapons and the breakout of a fellow heister who was sabotaged however some other extremely common community suggestions appear to be ignored or unaddressed gameplaythe heists are dynamic in a sense as camera placements loot quantities and placements as well as guard routes can change every time the map is played similar to that of left 4 dead 2 different events can also happen for the same heist and pose a challenge to the players although some do get annoying at times and when youve played long enough youll become experienced enough to handle the same old variationssome of the heists are also quite shortlived as they can end as quickly as they were started and there are not much objectives in the heists making the robberies highly repetitive and likely boring a new friend of mine was shocked at the completion of the heist within 3 minutes newer heists such as the big bank heist and hoxton breakout provide a quicker pace and a longer fight between the law enforcers and you but similarly it does not provide much variations as such the game has a balance of good and dull heists i had expected better seeing the awards thoughthere are four difficulties ranging from normal to death wish where overkill would be the commonest difficulty when youre experienced and death wish would provide a truly engaging experience unless you are stealthing and have not been caught however if you are new to the game dont be eager to start in these high difficulties although normal difficulty is truly boring even for a low levelyou can heist in singleplayer mode which limits you to yourself and 2 team ai bots or you can play multiplayer with 3 other players the singleplayer mode which can be played offline is annoying as overkill reduced the number of bots from 3 to 2 although the bots are tank on their own and can regenerate health and ammo the bots lack skills and ability to help transport loot making the player all on their own to carry out the goals bots can also be interrupted by law enforcers and makes it extremely annoying when they stop reviving you to fight back even when youre going to custody in a second or the revival would complete in a second bots are also essentially useless in stealth missions and all they do is to prepare in case the heist gets loud in multiplayer things are more interesting and payday 2 mainly revolves around multiplayer as different user interactions definitely makes the heist experience a more unique onebugs are also common to an extent in payday 2 while some are fixed in the following few patches others appear to be unresolved from day one till now graphicsplaying on 1920 x 1080 resolution there has not been any major gameplayaffecting pixelation yet and the lighting effects are not overemphasised which can cause the light bulbs to be brighter than the sun the law enforcers faces especially the snipers do look contorted though and probably can be improved some jagged edges are visible though unlikely to be noticed in normal gameplay graphic designs are however in general not neglected walls are vandalised with graffiti instead of being left blank food menus in the cafe stores are actually filled up and paintings can be destroyedthat being said the textures and details are often extremely blurred such as the bank branding on atm doors and food products even if you argue that the grafitti blurred out due to age its too blurred for any monitor with a resolution greater than 720p or somewhere there although this game is a few years old with the constant updates and huge game file size you would think it has better graphics than the current outdated one character featurespayday 2 follows system similar to that of rpg where there are 5 skill trees and several perk builds for you to choose from you gain skill points upon leveling up and perk points upon receiving xp although more dynamic compared to payday 1 as every player will now have slightly different builds and thus different abilities compared to a high level player which simply has everything the grinding can get tedious once you have reached level 70 or 80 this has been more or less rectified with the xp changes and it has been much easier to level up since thenpayday 2 also allows more customisation compared to payday 1 where you can customise the mask colour pattern and texture instead of simply choosing the masks this allows more than a few million combinations for masks to choose from although some are downright unappealing masks are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay other than showing your artistic senseweapons can also be customised using the limited range of weapon modifications which can be extended via dlc to gain access to better or more flexible mods some mods are achievementlocked and require you to grind for them musicthe soundtracks suits the gameplay rather well tensing up when law enforcement assault starts and slowing down when it ends giving an additional brief respite depending on the heist the soundtrack was based on it can be classical music a retrostyled music or even just exciting music that you can follow to the soundtrack dlc is needed if you want the mp3 or flac files which further allows you to customise your ingame soundtracks without the need to purchase other heist dlcs for the soundtrack pricingrefer to update verdictat its age i would have expected more than dlclocked content which are pumped out more often than free content which wouldnt have mattered as much if the dlcs are more reasonably priced despite the potential in the game i am upset that the game has Evolved into one that is simply moneymaking without actual new contentwe are not robbing banks guys we are the ones getting robbed

Tf2,"short reviewvirtual hat simulator with cashfull review storylinethe plot is simple there is a war going on between the builders league united blu and reliable excavation demolition red both subsidiaries of tf industries however due to problems lacking an obvious bureaucratic solution mercenaries are contracted to address the situation through war you join one of the two teams not permanently and play as one of the nine mercenaries hereby named classes which each has its own unique features in a war to attackdefend eg payload attackdefend control points or to gain control eg king of the hill 5cp special delivery gameplayclassesthe nine classes all play an important role in the game and having too many or the lack thereof of one class leads to an imbalanced team causing the team to suffer heavy penalties in terms of cooperating to push towards their objective the nine classes scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer sniper medic and spy all have their own distinct features ranging from invisibility cloaks to the all common 420blazeit sniper the weapons are more or less wellbalanced in the sense that no weapon is vastly considered to be better than the stock or another weapon although it does suit different fighting styleswith new maps almost or at least somewhat consistently introduced you get a different gameplay each time as you encounter players who genuinely help the team players who go in alone and complains no one is there to help or players who are so accurate with their shots and low ping you dont stand a chance unless you lag shot them with your 500 ping you might also join a friendly server where you see players just taunting and congaing or walking around and killing them earns you a kick or a callout for a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit weaponsmost weapons are attained through item drops which occur as you play so as to encourage playing until the item drop cap for that week is reached strange and festive variants can be obtained by using keys purchased with steam wallet to unlock normal rare and seasonal crates these are however purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay in anyway besides distracting you using the weapons you get you can craft them into another weapon of your liking or even get a chance to craft a more uncommon reskin weapon such as the mauler and sharp dresser some weapons can also be obtained via achievements and in general the weapons are considered sidegrades except for several medic melee weapons all the weapons can be considered to be both better and worse than the stock weapon you are given cosmetics online interactionteam fortress is wellknown as hat simulator using the weapon drops you get you can craft them into refined metals and eventually recombine them to get a common named as unique in the wiki and normal ingame quality hat Tf2 premium dlc is required obtained upon any ingame store purchase rarely you may also get hats or even taunts via item drops this purely decorates your character but does most of the gameplay here saw that coollooking unusual guy aim him saw that gibus an achievement hat guy aim him see that guy with ten thousand kills on his strange weapon aim him that dumbass guy who just started playing aim him theres some toxicity in every game so expect thatthe cosmetics also run all of the trading in Tf2 and it is what allows you to actually earn or lose money in terms of keys andor steam wallet by selling the keys on the market if you are lucky during an unbox you can also get an unusualquality cosmetic or taunt basically a normal cosmetic or taunt with an additional effect and this fetches a very high price in the market due to its highly valued effects market and player dependentyou can play the game fine if you do not care for cosmetics and you can simply find some traders or trading sites to exchange for the weapon you want trading is based on own personal experience which is unique to almost everyone and this can not exactly be reviewed online interactions are not rated verdictits a fine game for playing similar to those less traditional fps that you play ie not the counterstrike types other than tryhards who remain tryhards and you can never kill them or beggars or trolls which you can mute or change a server this game offers many playstyles which will definitely suit you at least one way or another"
Super_Meat_Boy,"lem me tell ya somethin this game is stupid no not that stupid this is the qwop of medicine at the moment of this writing it is very short eight levels long with only three different procedures the last two are variations of the iconic heart transplant for someone that isnt adept at using their keyboard and dexterity this game is hard so basically if you arent prepared to take time to get better at this game dont buy it and dont badmouth it i think i paid full price for this and i am more than happy with it its hard but not unfairly hard like in Super_Meat_Boy or something like that the game gives you tools and tells you you need to do x now i found doing was the easy part i just had no idea how to do the procedures so overall this game is good for a laugh you feel great once you finish a procedure and it provides a unique control system to master if youre thinking about buying this game go ahead and do so if youre still not sure i think the demo is around online"

The_Community,"despite being 4yearold game i still think that this game is worth playing this game doesnt actually require much skill in fps so its a relatively simple game for starters except higher difficulties the gameplay is fascinating with the addition of melee weapons in addition go ahead and use mods to enhance your gameplay experience if you think the game is not cool enough visit the steam workshop or l4dmapscom to download and install your favourite mods made by The_Community if you are a new player i suggest playing single player before heading into multiplayer get used to the weapons and campaigns first once you have acquired those skills then head into multiplayer make some friends and enjoy be careful though there are malacious players out there teamkilling and ruining the game on purpose so try to avoid playing with those players anyway i would recommend playing this game if you are a fan of zombiekilling or firstperson shooter games"

Tf2,"dirty bomb is a fast paced competitive fps shooter that is balanced and is definitely not a Tf2 clone apparently people say that this game scans your whole computer and stuff like that but i dont actually care the game fun even though my team lost 10 times in a row this game has currency but it doesnt force you to buy itpros free fun balanced kinda gameplay not pay to win good graphicscons grinding grinding grinding not much content phantoms everywhere it takes days for me to update the game 80100 mbs internet speed 1gb update bad my laptop cant handle it well runs slow for mesuggestion how about a singleplayer training mode or something besides the tutorial how about instead of loadout cards use weapon cards and perk cards instead having a customizable loadout would be nice"
The_Community,"i have played killing floor for around 23 years straight and only now am i getting a little bored of it this creation from the unreal engine is completley satisfying for a survival zombie game although it is not a traditional zombie survival game its is still the funnest if not the best zed based game i have ever played the pure comical action with the witty and slandish british comedy that riddles the game is fantastic and the fps mechanics are just perfect although there are a few glitches in the system when changing weapons and such but this is mainly due to the inferiority of the engine not that actual game and they are quite bearablethe visuals are decent not fantasitic or amazing but they will satisfy you for the game itself makes up for that the gore is perfect everyshot fired feels real and satisfying the headshots that you will lay into the zeds are fullfilling and many the variety of zeds are also fullfilling with a total of 10 different types of zeds this is not including the patriarch which is a large overpowered macho boss that you will encounter at the end of each match in which all are completley different from one another in the tradition of zombie survival games the multiplayer capabilities are just great they are solid perfected and polished a total of 6 players can be in a server at a time to which there can be one of each class exempt one there are seven different classes to which are all different in which all can have class specific weapons although the support specialist and the commando seem to be quite similarthere are 5 diferent difficulties begginer normal hard suicidal hell on earth to which their titles suggest exactly what they are the first two difficulties are fairly easy to take by yourself if you are a faitrly experienced player but the rest are quite difficult even for a full server of gold ranked players also whichin each class there are six ranks the sixth is gold there is definalty great replayability in this game as to reach gold rank it will take you quite some time personally for me to get to a gold rank demolitionist took me around a year for playing around 4 hours an afternoon and not every afternoon but if you do not want to put in the hours for the reward there are a variety of farming maps in The_Community and ever since steam created the workshop for kf The_Community has grown greatlyi give killing floor a 710 also kf 2 is coming out soon and looks great you may want to wait for that if this doesnt catch your fancy instantly"

Tf2,"if you dont have this game then you should get itedit moral of the story buy this gamemod but if you tend to get plenty of mods be patient when loading the game i know this from having this game crash serveral thousand freaking timesnote i was also yiffed by a animatronic while i was the medic from Tf2 just when i thought things couldnt get anymore disturbing or was it nope it was disturbing nothing else sickosalso please ignore my grammar issues on any of my reviews its a bad habit i can not control"

Garrys_Mod,"i find this game to be a bit of a mix between spacebuild from Garrys_Mod and the sandbox of minecraft it has the exact same atmosphere as both and i love the gravitational and collisional physics ofcourse the game has a few bugs but they can be easily avoidedin the blackness of space you assume it to be boring but that is very far from the truth there is so much to do infact that i actually have my hands full"
Garrys_Mod,"its a game i recommend for you but only to play with your friends as when you finish the story there is only some multiplayer modes left in there and so Garrys_Mod does not use alot of mods that need this game so buy it with your friends or dont buy it as you will exaust the single player aspect rather quickly"

Dont_Starve,"Dont_Starve is one of the best games i have played a great and fun game in both single and multiplayer dst it does eventually get boring but that is after one gets to day 200 i play offline so the hours dont record but getting to that stage is immensely difficult and the games cost is far less than the entertainment you will get playing it overall buy it and play it as you will likely enjoy it"

Terraria,"ill say that i like robots and that i like the wild west it has both so i cant complain steamworld dig is a great mining game with several influences such as terarria megaman and metroid you play as rusty who has inherited an old mine from his uncle the main objective is to mine collect ores sell them and reach for the bottem of the mine it was originally released on 3ds and the game is quite appealing to the eye they managed to add quite a bit of colour for a mining game which is nice the music is decent but i wouldnt say catchy it more melds right into the game which is great as it adds to the game the mining in the game is all about risk versus reward and it is done quite superblyoverall i give it 8510 its fun looks great and you can play the game in your own pace if youre not a big fan of games like minecraft or Terraria you should at least give this a go because for people like me it has a story and an ending plus the game has a bit to offer"

The_Community,"great game on some servers The_Community can be particularly friendly however on some it is all out war building towns bases and forming clans is quite an incredible experience and the feeling of your first gun is incredible buy this game"
The_Community,"the alpha of h1z1 was off to a very rocky start the game was absolutely riddled with bugs rendering it almost unplayable and to make it worse we found out that while soe had said that the only buyable objects would be cosmetic we later found out that this was not the case every person on the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit server with a couple of bucks to spare was calling in an air drop giving them guns tools and food so that they would have a major advantage over the competition but luckily those days are far behind us thanks to one of the best alpha development teams i have ever experienced they listen to what everyone in The_Community says most bugs are fixed within a day of them being reported and the rest they choose to keep working on full bore until they are fixed and i must say thank god they fixed the air drops air drops are now easily able to be seen by whoever is in your corner of the map the range in which they are dropped is far greater meaning that as opposed to you buy an air drop and you get it you are instead having to compete with a barrage of other players for your prize and finally the drop rate of things like guns and other weapons in an air drop has been dramatically reduced so that they won ' t set you to far ahead of the competition this has all helped to turn the game into a far more playable and enjoyable alphaif you want to get an idea of what the game might be like then just picture this day z but made by a far greater team with superior skill and coding knowledge who will in turn choose to listen to what their players ask for and fix every bug that crops up this game is how day z should have been the forest could have been and rust will never bei must put this out there this game is the most fun that i have ever had in an alpha or even a beta for that matter and i am putting that down to the wonderful team of devs behind itthe animations though only in alpha are beautiful and fluid there is a smooth transaction between different actions and a polished look to them normally only seen in finished games the graphics while not that bad could definitely use some texture updates before the final release of the game as they are currently looking a few years behind schedule but that is only expected in an alpha and finally i must just put it out there to all you gaming bullet fans that this is currently the most polished and enjoyable alpha on the steam market and thanks to some beautiful optimization it is playable on most average systems but never fear if you are currently strapped for cash but wish you could still play the game it will be free to play to the general public upon final releaseone thing that i have currently forgotten to mention is the beautiful design of the games ai zombies are as dumb as they should be and not much of a problem alone but are attracted to things such as sound meaning if you fire a gun at the wrong moment you could have a pack of as large as fifty zombies hunting you down at once which can cause quite a problem the way they have designed and built this ai really impressed me they act exactly as you would imagine a zombie should dumb and only a problem in numbers and this ai design has carried over to other creatures found in the game world from skittish deers to ferocious wolves ready to attack anything in their sight and terrifying bears who once locked onto you are probably some of the most dangerous creatures in the gamethe combat in this game has been beautifully designed the actions are smooth and you are actually able to feel the power as you send a fist flying into a zombies head as they send a hand back flying towards you the weapons while in most cases rare are very powerful and will give you a huge advantage over the competition while items such as combat knives and machetes will give you the upper hand in close quarters combat a bullet from any of the guns can be absolutely devastating but remember that a gunshot can be heard miles away so be careful not to attract the horde or worse another human hungry for your bloodso have i enjoyed h1z1 in the two short weeks this game has been out it has come so very far from the buggy pay to win mess it once was to the beautifully polished and enjoyable alpha it is today i must say that it is hands down the most enjoyable alpha or even beta that i have ever played it has been twenty dollars well spent and all thanks to the amazing team of helpful and responsive devs creating it i would strongly advise any of you zombie or survival fans out there to give this work of art a try and all that i am left to say is that i can honestly not wait for the next big update and eventually the final release of the game soe you have really outdone yourself this timecheck out more reviews and previews at gamingbulletcom"

The_Community,"ive only played 30 hours of this and quite frankly it is spectacular it does require some hefty hardware to play the game maxed out as anyone would expect from a game with a great physics engine but you will enjoy it i wrote this review just after the exploration release and it has advanced space engineers alot faster than any other games in terms of development in an alpha stage thanks to the great developers they truly connect with The_Community and the modding side is easy to use the ui can be a bit tough to use at first but after a while you will get used to it this is my dream game and i look forward to seeing it progress and so far it has done a great job in fulfilling my dream"

Nether,"this is an excellent survival horror game as it manages to keep a suspensful atmosphere throughout your experience and manages to create a very realistic postapocalyptic city by uitilizing the use of shrubbery broken building crashed helicopters masses of derelict weather damaged cars as well as of course the players who mostly seem to be very paranoid towards eachother as well as very distrustful this greatly helps to create a tense and frightening atmosphere in which the players survive and one final thing the Nether of course they are not only scary as crap in appearance but they can also teleport and are extremely powerful depending on the variety speaking of which there are many all of these assets greatly help to create a great survival horror experience for the Nether game ps it is still in alpha so there will be a few bugs"
The_Community,"the pay2win level of this game is just it can be played casually and without investing any money in it but then you would be at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that you have weapons that barely match theirsi honestly tried to get to the max level but every time they updated the level cap would just increase and the fact that you rank up too slowly without the exp multiplier that the premium players get just forced me to play this game for hours on endi eventually stopped at rank 100 the max rank is probably 235 by nowthe games matchmaking system is purely unbalanced if youre a bronze threat playeryou basically get treated like dirt and get matched up against goldies and also the backup that you get usually doesnt match the power that the opposition has unless of course you roll with a clan thats filled with 150 ranked silvers and goldiesbut then again there are some actually decent people that actually have skill in playing this its just a bit sad that The_Community is just but still i would recommend it with friends and also dont take this game too seriously"

Team_Fortress_2,"counterstrike global offensive is the latest installment in the counterstrike series nothing much has changed in this installment other than updated graphics veterans to the series are going to love counterstrike global offensive but newcomers sadly i can not guarantee that you will like this game even if you know you like the game the very difficult learning curve might get to you before you even have a chance to completely enjoy the game but its worth giving the game a shot to some its too old school and it lacks features the new flashy modern first person shooters have ads aim down sights sprint etc but in my opinion this one of the greatest fps out on the market what most fps lack is a sense of competitve nature sure you can make bets and cmon bro 1v1 me bro ill smash you people but in my opinion its not enough if you love competitve gaming particually in fps then theres another point to counterstrike there are so many things that make counterstrike global offensive a worthy game in your steam game library for me to list so do me a favor do the counterstrike community a favor and pick up this game for around 1500 au dont know how much in other currencies im sure you can do the math youre getting a good deal operations which are like free dlc updates but have limited time on playing the maps that are released in the operation skins which are probably the most infectious disease in a game second to the infamous Team_Fortress_2 hats and overall just fun u2late approves dnotes sorry if there are grammar and spelling mistakes i typed this up without checking for errors sorry grammar nazis p like this up if you found it useful so others can see have fun"

Evolve,"evoland when asked to sum it up i would say is fairly hard to do it is a great indie game that changes Evolves and develops as you play it starting as a black and white 2d adventure game like the original legend of zelda and developing into a fully coloured 3d free roam adventure rpg more like final fantasy the game is enjoyable short and funny and has a great soundtrack i would definitely recomend this game to lovers of old adventure games and whom want to relive their history and all the changes they have gone through to become what they are todaythanks for reading jazza"

Half_Life_2,"okay how should i say this omg its one of the most exciting zombie video games of all timeno more room in hell was a multiplayerbased Half_Life_2 mod that was released in 2011 which has been in development nearly 7 years the game has been released on steam in 2013 as a full game and that means steam users dont need Half_Life_2 to play the gamethe game has two modes an objectivebased mode and a survival mode the objectivebased is a simple point to point level which needs players to fight hordes of zombies in their way while theyre going to the main objective while the survival mode puts players in a scenario which players have to survive and kill some waves of hungry zombiesthere are three types of zombies normal flesheating romerotype walker zombies running zombies and children zombiesyou can also have the ability to play the game in single player mode just go to the create server menu with no other players and just dive in into the gamethe games tense and dark atmosphere made the games very fun and scary to explore especially if you wander alone like a lost explorer most maps are pretty dark so you need flashlight to explore the games levels you can also use a lighter but it can only lights a bit of an areaweapons in this game are pretty badass from pistols to smgs knives to machetes baseball bats to sledgehammers and semiautomatic rifles to shotguns the game also have some types of ammo which firearms with a same ammo type can be used however there are still some flaws in this game which sometimes made the experience a little bit boring and annoying one of em is the stiff wooden and unrealistic character animations the lack of body deformation features on zombies the lack of allied bot support on single player mode and the depiction of children zombies there are also no extra game modes other than the objective and survival modes and the fact that the game didnt have some character and weapons customization featuresstill it is one of the most exciting and scariest zombie survival video games of all time i gave nmrih 8710"

The_Community,"this game continues with many of the features that have been entering the game in past few years one of the major changes in this game is that you need to contract with sponsors to maintain your team this being that your team and all other teams change each year possibly even 5times in 5 years this change increases the game play in my opinion other than that The_Community updates and modifications upgrade the game greatly by adding a larger number of teams variants and the like of course there is always the occassional result which is unlikely to happen such as a 55mountain climber winning major mountain stagesoverall this game series improves each year"

Csgo,"basic gameplayyou play as either a counterterrorist or a terrorist both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choiceyou can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot youon the terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm important boxesanyway once plant wait you patiently for it to explodeas a counterterrorist you must eliminate all the terrorist forces or defuse the bomb thus protecting those ever important boxes from certain destructionbeing a honourable opponent terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the cts the chance to slaughter the remaining ts and defuse the bombill list some positivenegative attributes of this game herepositive attributes matchmaking teaches children the harsh reality of gambling although some never seem to learn even after 500 later ranks cool looking skins fast growing population of players fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often chickens high replay value deathmatch game type i could go into more detail on negative parts of it but that would make this review too long and boringnegative attributes although i do love the single player campaign it could use some work i really wish it were longer and that final boss fight is pretty lame it only lasts around 27 seconds and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you and how his 7 year old could beat you blindfolded the game mode infernal played on the map deinfernosome people like this game mode however i personally dislike it for those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it ill explain for youit seems like any normal de map however the real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego normally its hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map and has the ability to shiftmove around to different locations or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time demolition also known as jokemode added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every april fools day however some hacker probably that 4chan guy permanently unlocked it volvo have been working on a fix ever sincedemolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents also no block is enabled and whoa so is team killingthe volka strategyyou could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins or you could play the game correctly like me here is my strategy dont buy skins to start with seriously its a waste of money play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get wait for a steam sale and invest in as many copies of Csgo you can work your way up to about 5 copies or so but make sure you dont get too many otherwise you wont have enough time to harvest all your Csgo account drops having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns note it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have remember to never gamble with opening cases ive made about 100 with this method i think its about time to quit my day jobin a whole i do love this game and would recommend to anyone good half good half"

Evolve,"dark souls is an action roleplaying game set in an open environment the game Evolves around the player character who escapes from an asylum and soon learns the prophecy of being selected as the chosen undead who must succeed in undoing the undead cursethe games plot is minimalistic and varies based upon how much the player explores there is little guidance and lack of direction given the player must come to hisher intuition as to which path one must take which can ultimately lead to a dead end desired destination or even branching pathsthis game is not just an ordinary casual rpg it is a survival rpg for hardcore players who seek a challenge as dying is frequent and minibosses are abundant to add to that monsters deal a lot of damage and players must learn to time their blocks and attacks rather than hack n slashing save points are limited and scattered far from one another the game Evolves around the concept of using deaths to teach players to learn from their mistakes as well as how to react in almost relentlessly hostile environments from experience there has not been many rpgs that has challenged me the way dark souls has i must reiterate this game is extremely difficultthe button mapping and camera controls for keyboard is messy if one were to consider buying this game it is a prerequisite to have a gamepadcontroller or you will be in for a hard time the graphics is not the best but it is made up by the deep gameplay and nonstop actionoverall dark souls is a quality rpg game that challenges players to a new level it is matched with sheer happiness and relief upon progress and completion if adventure is to surprise and mystify you and invite you to uncover the secrets of a forgotten world then dark souls is a great game for you if entertainment is fun without failure and progress without pain youll have to find another game"

Csgo,"at its core global offensivecounter strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken microsoft mousesthe emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around it creates an atmosphere that games like battlefield and call of duty hasnt been able to reproduce on the outside counter strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned fps gamerthe game is simply tactful it ' s brilliant when you ' re alive and even when you ' re dead the game is still fun to watch other playersglobal offensive is a competitive game and a casual one although for casual gamers its probably better to find community servers over valve servers theres a huge market place now for the items in Csgo and not only that theres third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these ingame items have createdyou will also find on twitch Csgo is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions if you need any convincing watch a stream watch a competitive match and see for yourselfthis game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself"

Tf2,"kills time got it for the Tf2 hat still had a load of fun"
The_Community,"i havent gotten all the achievements and there i didnt read each and every entry yet so my full experience has yet to be complete but i can review this with confidence regardlessthis game is amazing i can not begin to describe how enjoyable i found it from the voice acting to the scenery its utterly immersive but ill go through individually to break it downthe gameplay this game features a first or third person perspective while you go about solving puzzles for things called sigils this is the core mechanic of the game you must collect these to advance which means you must solve the puzzles and frankly speaking it was very enjoyable i found the puzzles were not overly tricky and most involve some planning ahead but at no point was i dreading going to the next puzzle it never got stale so if you do puzzles then youll enjoy this game off of that alone however that is not the only thing this game is about the talos principle is a philosophical adventure as well you are continuously guided by a deep voice called elohim and he openly states that he is the maintainer and creator of the world youre in and that you must go along as per his wishes to trancend to heaven this however is met with an issue when you discover another personentity on the computers found in every level named milton or as he is referred to by elohim the serpent as you progress milton will continuously press you with really challenging and thought provoking questions and this is where this game really hooked me i literally found myself battling with flaws in my ways of thinking its so mind tripping and intense and i love it if you enjoy these things then you will also like the gamesoundtrack the sounds in this game are really scenic and help solidify the mood of the various worlds it will at times intensify during intermission worlds such as the a b and c buildings and at other times mellow out such as during a few of the puzzles it very effectively immersifies as well by simulating environments such as birds chirping with a waterfall while playing slow deep based music to really get a calm feeling seeping into the player i was thoroughly pleased with the use of sounds in this game especially because you can play at your own place and i found myself just stopping and looking around nice and slowly at times to really enjoy this game sceneryasthetics holy hell this game was amazing with its looks granted at times my computer would start buffering because it was on ultra i found that even on high i was just completely immersed and mesmerised by the scenery it features a realatively large closed in map in all the worlds and the look is very convincing to the point where you go to a place where a messenger is and it was just beautiful easily one of my favorite places story i will not be doing any spoilers or anything there are 3 endings ive done 2 of them with the last one not being done being the easiest to accomplish cough basic completion and i found myself disappointed when it ended yet completely satisfied with the endings this games quarrels between elohim and milton quite apparently mirrors the god vs devil kind of storyline but rather than telling the player who is good or who is bad we are tasked with trusting our instincts and coming to our own conclusions throughout the game as well we see many qr codes which are translated into messages these messages are from other sigil seekers and they show the very different outlooks people may have when faced with such a situation as either scepticism or complacency this game has a simple plot overall of that there is no doubt but its the characters and interactions with the environment that make this game great ive left this segment seperate but this is also part of the story you will find audio files these files depict one alexander drennan a person who shares her thoughts on the outlook of the world human beings and our creations she touches on some deep and maybe depressing topics but she does so effectively she very much is in my opinion one of the most immersive and enjoyable aspects of the game the voice actor erin fitzgerald did an amazing job voicing her and we learn the means that built up to the talos principle i will not diverge into it as i think thats part of the enjoyment and what builds a drive to find all the files and information cons there are things in the game called stars they are what they sound like golden stars these things are hidden in almost every level of every hub world 73 there are 30 in total 3 are found in the main transistional world where the tower lays these things are heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t im not even joking had i not looked up a tutorial to find them all i would never have found them you have to do the most heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t things interact multiple puzzles with each other find hidden passages ladders and switches and frankly its just tedious through the stars you unlock 3 worlds these worlds have 9 sigils in total that are needed for the secret ending i very much dislike how heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing hidden and annoying they are i didnt even know there were so many stars needed until about halfway through honestly a drag you will need a guide for this its a bit short a game if youre only here for puzzles then you will have such a short playthrough the only reason i have 20 hours on record is due to doing everything with the exception of a few acheivements this by no means stops it from being a great game it really is i would buy this full price just be wary that if you truly want to draw everythign out of the game take it slow otherwise you will probably be disappointedof all of the games ive enjoyed this game is damn near the top i give it a 910 easy i look forward to the dlc when i can afford itedit ive just completed the dlc road to gehenna it is beautiful in its own way it has the same atmosphere as the vanilla game and obviously still has puzzles and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t stars but it also touches on a more existenal take seeing many characters trapped in elohims prison going through all the messages on the boards reading what they have and The_Community theyve built it really does show how society can really becomes this entangled mess i wouldnt say it had the same impact as the vanilla which i believe is due to the lack of voice over erin fitzgerald truley made the game a massive experience for me and it definitely didnt touch much on the same existenal crisis that the vanilla did in my opinion it was by no means disappointing but if i hadnt have been so invested into the story of the vanilla that i got all the endings but the basic then i dont think the dlc at full price i got it during discount would have been worth it in my opinion i think the vanilla is the main meat of it and the dlc wraps it in a nice little bow overall this game is phenomenal and i can not stress that it will forever have a place in my heart and recommendation list"

Portal,"whilst at first i intentionally held off from purchasing this game as many of my friends did not have it and the fact that its prior incarnation decided to wipe itself of save files several times i decided to take the plunge into borderlands 2 when two other friends decided to purchase it during a steam sale since then there has been no regret to buying this product the graphics have greatly improved the gameplay is tighter and faster paced and the humour is nearly original Portal level in my opinion with lots of clever quips and references that you have to really see and search forthere is one thing however that must be though of when purchasing this make sure you have a friend to play it with because as with any game that requires a bit of grinding a friend goes a long way to seperating boredom from adventures into hilaritya geniunely good game if you do not mind the occasional what the heck moments from enemies"

Css,"i bought this game almost a year ago and i will now show my thoughts and feelings towards this game i never played 16 but i played something like 48 hours of Css the beauty of the game is how much more simpler and to the point it is no kill streaks you have to constantly worry about being destroyed by and no perks which can make games very uneven everything is just available to you as soon as you download it the only purchasable items give you no advantage and are simply just cosmetic items which some people will go in great lengths to collect gathering an inventory of up 10k i played the casual game mode for the first 24 hours of the game and then finally hopped in matchmaking where you are given a rank after 10 games you only get matched up with people around the same skill level as you which is great unlike other games where you get destroyed until you manage to gather enough skill to fight backthere are some hackers in this game who try to hide that but often they eventually get banned by vac or overwatch which is a thing in the game which gives experienced players the chance to watch games where players think the suspect was hacking to which they then choose a verdictthe game is good for veterans and newbies alike as gun play and movement has since been changed since older titles overall the game is a must buy for anyone into competitive first person shooters and the great thing being that i have earned the 15 back just from getting and selling items that randomly dropped in game for me its wonderful1010 without some heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit 1 line joke review"

The_Community,"i never really heard of it and boy i should havemy friends reccomended it when we were looking for a cooperative shooter to playmy god i love this gameheres the scenario youve been stranded on a zombieinfested island and your goal is to survive pretty simple at first until you relize everything is very limited your first gun might have 2 bullets in the clip this makes finding melee weapons like axes or sledgehammers very lucky The_Community varies once your with a group of friendly people and the next thing your surrounded by bandits and taken hostagethis game looked really simple on the outside but when you play a rough hour of it you will start to notice how immersive the game can feelthere will also be scenarios where you have to make a hard decision the game does not script that this will happen in any way possible will you go to the town and look for supplies will you abbandonn your friend to the zombies and make an escape will you eat the moldy corn and risk infectionthe choice is yours and it can and will impact on what happens afterhowever the game does have some downsides which might not be a big problemthe shadows and details can sometimes screw my pc around esspecialy if you have skype onsometimes the game can break by not spawning items properly like once the only things i could find in a town is moldy corn and clips i restarted the game and everything was fine there were clothes notes bows and everything else you might find in a postapocalyptic townthe respawn time does not exsist in this game once you die you can quickly sprint back into the game and hope for something different to happenout of all games i had not found such a zombie survival like this one aside from dayz of course9510"

Evolve,"having played insurgency many years ago as a source mod back in 2007 i was curious to see if it had Evolved to the point of being a game worth buying in its own right and i wasnt let downinsurgency plays as a cross between the arcadey high action flow of counterstrike and the unforgiving brutality red orchestra 2 you essentially are given varying objectives to accomplish and a modest set of weapon and loadout options to choose from which is handy because if you are bad at fps games you will be using the majority of your time in spectator playing around with it bullets from highpowered rifles tend to onehitkill you if they manage to bypass whatever kevlar you have equipped and you will feel very very vulnerable when moving between buildingsplaying this game is the first time in a while ive actually been grinning playing an fps for many many years the lethality of the firearms makes moving from point to point tense your decisions matter and your reaction times are crucialnotably it doesnt suffer the superfluous unlocking and premium mechanics of the battlefields of the day your killstreaks dont earn you an attackdog airstrike which brings me to my next pointeveryone everyone is on an even keel and its all down to how well you play or how badly you play as when you die you will be spectating your comrades playing and teasing the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out of them in group chat or using the spare time to tweak your loadout to better match the pace of the combatim happy to say that this is well worth the small price buy the fourpack give them to your buddies and pretend its 2002 at a counterstrike lanedit almost forgot it has coop play too810 solid no frills fps action brutal combat tense and frantic gameplay coop reminds me of vietcong 2 good fun source graphics nothing to write home about but who cares do not get this if dying frustrates you"
The_Community,"if you enjoy a shooter with some good old objective based play then give this a try over the years i have played them all but seem to find dirty bomb a breath of fresh air the mercs are fun the loadout system is unique the devs splash damage and publishers nexon are really enthusiastic and supportive of The_Community as well as willing to listen to the players in shaping the game in the end its free its fun and i highly recommend"
The_Community,"state of decay is an open world zombie apocalypse survival simulation made by a smaller studio as such some gameplay ideas are not as well formed as they could be and some bugs persist despite ongoing updates support perhaps the studios vision is slightly greater than their grasp but the support to date has been great and most major issues have been addressed aside from few nigglesof note the simulation aspect means that characters in your group will take the initiative do things for themselves however the ai is probably not quite up to scratch in handling some of the micro associated with this clever macro idea if you just dont like any loss of control at all even when your machine is off then this may annoy you a lot however is is reasonably unobtrusive and does add a degree of simgamelike satisfaction if your community is happy and well supplied then it will tick along nicely the inverse is also true and there are endless opportunities for player agency to influence The_Communitys state the game answers your questions about how zoey and the team from left 4 dead stay so well fed and where exactly those grenade launchers come from it is engaging well thought out and likely to continue to be tweaked and refinedit reminds me of stalker l4d fallout tactics if that helps highly recommended"
Dont_Starve,"honestly this is probably the most well put together early access game ive ever seen and klei deserve every cent of your money for it you wont run out of things to do see and create in a very broad sense Dont_Starve is comparable to minecraft on ketamine"
Tf2,"i have no idea how to play poker but this game is awesome the best 250 i spent at the christmas salesthe banter between characters is awesome and the Tf2 unlocks are nice achievement items only not tradableif you play Tf2 get this game especially if you are a heavy fan also recomend this as a my first poker game if you want to learn to play poker by trial and errorvery nice to play"
Tf2,"this game used to be epic not anymore infact not for a long time now too many little kids and f2p players acting like jerks and swearing over the mic or in the chat box i play video games to meet new friends and have fun and this game is not fun anymore nothing seems to be done about the poor behaviour either as its has gotten progressivley worse over the last few months especially on official mvm servers making this game f2p has killed it sorry killed it for me if they make an update where the premium players dont have to deal with the f2p riff raff and make age restricted servers ill come back if not sorry valve you have lost a customer its not worth the stress and anger and urge anyone who considers playing this game to be wary of the disgusting behaviours by players or avoid this game for a bit i know valve will sort this out eventually as they are a great company please make Tf2 and enjoyable experience again"
Tf2,"i cant play Tf2 becuase of one of the update now any time i want to play Tf2 i get the blue tv of death ps yes i use a tv to play games"
Team_Fortress_2,"an extremely fun game with hints of a call of duty playstyle and Team_Fortress_2 wackiness the balance of the two styles makes the game unique giving the feel of a competitive game that doesnt take itself seriously i recommend this game to any lovers of first person shooters however this game does come with its fair share of issuesthe matchmaking issues are present making it seem as if there arent any players online as i am in australia i had to change my steam download region to us chicago to have any hopes of playinga seeming lack of dedicated servers seem present as the game most of the time assigns a host for the matches making gameplay very laggy at timesthis aside gotham city impostors is still a very solid game that needs an equally solid community to keep it alivei still however recommend this game"

Csgo,"even cod comes up with new concepts every few years or soCsgo doesnt feel like a new game it feels like counter strike it hasnt changed much some people may like that but if you are a person that doesnt play 1 game for 10 years then you will probably be underwhelmed verdict if you have never played cs then you can get it if you played previous version of cs you may get bored"
Tf2,"i waited a long time to buy this i played cs for years back when going to a lan cafe and paying by the hour was still a thing then years went by and despite having css in my library i never really went back to it i was happy with Tf2 and payday 2 for all my shooter needs then steam sales and whatnot happened and after reading about 50 steam reviews i decided what the heck and bought it5 hours in and im very happy i did csgo has planted a bomb at site a my heart i dont know if that metaphor works but yes i was surprised i played a bit of casual before taking a deep breath and jumping into a comp matchwow such fun i wasnt flamed for being awful i was playing with people with dozens and hundreds of hours on their cs clock and still managing to be slightly better than completely uselessand now with all this Tf2 style unlockable heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit which i am a complete sucker for and a variety of challenged and whatnot this game now has a place on my coverted favourites highly recommend even at full price 15 its a great deal cheaper than cod or bf and i would argue better in many ways get on it"

Portal,"simply amazing at first you think its a puzzlemaze game akin to Portal but it has the richness of a storyline like myst you gain more knowledge about the world youre in as you progress through the game and you find youre stuck wanting to learn more very addicting im pretty stupid and even i could work out most puzzles myself"
Tf2,"a very entertaining sandbox game perfect for anyone wanting to mod or create cool things with the halflife objects or just heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit aroundhowever i highly recommend you get css Tf2 and maybe the two halflife 2 episodes ot get the most out of it since many servers will use stuff from the above especially css weapons even if you dont though its still very fun to play get it nao"

Tf2,"team fortress 2 aka Tf2 is one of my all time favourites and was the game that brought me into the steam comunity over 5 years ago now bought it before it was free and was definately worth it 3 fantastic game no matter what class or what map your on with all the mods and varrying game modes its never a dull game for me"

Terraria,"after never really getting into minecraft or Terraria i never actually thought i would enjoy this game but i took the dive and let the hype train come over me and boy was this the right decision one of the best games ive played this year and it is still in beta now that is saying somethingi havent felt like such a part of a community since the wow vanilla days but this brings back all those feelings againbuy this game in beta you will not regret it"
The_Community,"there is very little not to love about this game the vanilla content is finished to an amazing level of polish the physics are onpoint in almost every car slides are catchable you can feel the tyre wall flex when you approach the limit you can feel the front end push and the back end skate around more than any sim ive ever played the ffb in this game is different to any other game on the market right now for the first few hours the wheel felt dead to me because you only recieve the forces that would be translated to the wheel in the actual car not a bunch of canned effects as well with a t500 the ffb is exact and a pleasure to drive with once you get used to it seriously if you dont own this game and you like sims buy this now and theres a laser scanned nordschleife now whats not to lovebeyond the devs there are truly incredible mods from The_Community i would strongly reccomend the t5 dtm cars from united racing design theyre like the best sim cars ive ever driven and are well worth the price of admission theres millions of other great mods though look on race department and you will find what you desirethere are some areas that are lacking in my opinion for example there are no pit stops or longer races the career system is pretty lackluster the ai still does some weird things and the visual damage modeling is not quite up to scratch yet overall though this game is worth every single cent and then some"

The_Community,"ive being playing this game since the beginning i may not have overclocked hours into like others but ive been here apart of The_Community for a while i have seen the updates and the progress adding new content improving gameplay and twecking features overall ive been happy but this game is dying the one thing that has cut the last straw is that fact that i have to wait 1520 minutes to join a game that doesnt last no longer than 60 seconds and im not over reacting after wasting my time on average a game lasts no longer than 60 seconds cause of this constant long time consumption i have now uninstalled this game as the developers are too worried about releasing new content instead of fixing numerous problems maybe well see in the future if they decide to fix it ill reinstall it again and play again with mates but its not just me its a large majority who have the same problem"

Tf2,"fun game engaging sort of a Tf2 meets brink"
Metro_2033,"loving the storyline of Metro_2033 followed by the insanely realistic gameplay definitely worth buying if you love a good thriller"
The_Community,"the way i see this game is you are either going to love it or you are going to hate it it is in early alpha and it is hard to say whether i think it is worth waiting or picking up nowi personally find the game pretty fun and entertaining but that is just my competitive side talking The_Community is going to be a rough one lot of games with this kill or be killed mentality often have a horrible community starting out lot of people want to kill you because they are curious what you have and want to take it from you it definitely brings the savages out in the world RIRE think if you played dayz minecraft and any other survival type game you may like this game very much but if the kill or be killed mentality is not for you then i would not recommend it they have non pvp servers so it may be an option but majority are pvpi really think the game needs a way to encourage people to work together rather than get greedy and become savage bandits but do so in a way that does not affect the players negatively i often like roleplaying with these kind of games but due to the people out for blood it makes the roleplay very difficult or impossible you are just put in a tough decision to kill as self defence"
Evolve,"i dont understand how dayz can fall right on its face when it comes to majority of the features it lacks and mostly how they can charge 30 for an alpha and this game has everything dayz offers plus a tad more and is completely freeif you want a good survival game and dont want to pay 30 for dayz or even 20 for rust which are both incomplete alpha early access gamesthen this is what you want i have no problem with early access games if they follow a similar route with this this should once again be a clear example and proof that gameplay is more important than graphics this game is not perfect but it is much more fleshed out than the competition here is some positives and negativesyou have skills like crafting shooting survival outdoors stealth that you can increase with expthe map is a good size for nowyou can craft and build houses with different items some recipes are uniquethe game offers a challengeif you want basic roleplay and become a bandit and kill other players then you canyou can make use of your current groups on steam to build a factiondid i mention it is free with optional gold membershipmultiplayer at the moment is pretty limited i recommend Evolve or hamachi as you can not join servers unless you portforward crafting system is good but a bit confusing at times i have not quite figured it out but i do enjoy the lack of handholding zombies ai could use little improvements overall it is good but may be overpowered to some people melee weapon is requiredgraphics some people might find this a negative i honestly do not even though i think because of simple graphics they are capable to deliver the great features but some might complain it looks like kids drawing RIRE doesnt give you alot of gameplay elements you can expect in the game does not discuss most of the featuresaside from those the game has a great start i dont know if this is being developed by only one person but if soyou manage to achieve the basic barebones of what is beginning of a game something i feel lot of these zombie apocalypse survival games are not doing good at they just have basic mechanics"

Tf2,"so its only in open beta at the moment but its a real solid game right now sort of what Tf2 would be if Tf2 wasnt such a muck around game its hella fast paced movement speed is really high for all classes and you can wall jump and stuff and mostly balanced there are minor balance issues but the game is constantly being updated and as such the game is generally getting more balanced with each patch the company behind this game seems to quite involved with the community as well and is constantly adding and trialling new content which is nice my only really gripe is its pay model like most free to play fps games you have the option of buying sidegrades with both real and ingame currency each merc class costs a ludicrous amount of ingame currency either 30k or 50k credits where you seldom get 1k per match while i really enjoy grinding for things in game this just seems a tad excessive given there are other things you can spend your credits on it just makes me feel like to get the most out of this game i have to invest actual money into it its just something that irks me but i totally understand why its in the game and its not a particularly terrible thin considering the game is every bit as playable with 2 mercs as it is with 10all in all a great fps that is the right combination of competitive and fun"

Dota_2,"this game is so fun with friends learning how to play can be so simply this game is evenly matched to league of legends their pretty much the same concept level up your hero and destroy the main heart of the base expect all heroes are unlocked on Dota_2 but in RIRE you have to pay to buy new heroes and skins something that might make people go crazy but i think Dota_2 should be as much the same popular aspects and i just love it when i get a high kill streak making me feel like a god and winning matches with friend i recommed this game for steam users and enjoy 910"
Undertale,"alright so this is coming from a guy who doesnt necessarily not like but isnt a fan of traditional rpgsif youre doubting buying this game look how much time ive sunk into it its not overly long like other rpgs i got the normal and true endings in a little over 12 hours gameplay and to be quite honest i dont have the heart to do the genocide ending but itll take a lot longer if you explore every nook and cranny the worldnow youre probably thinking gee willikers only 12 hours is this pile of poop really worth tenbuxmy answer is simply hell heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit in yesadmittedly it might take a certain type of person to really enjoy this game and if youre not a fan of rpgs this game probably isnt for you but if youre that type of person wow Undertale is definitely a candidate for goty this game will toy with your emotions throw curveballs at you when you least expect it probably frustrate you with a couple of fights and you will love every single moment of it and also probably cry and definitely laughand even then if youre still doubting buying this video game after reading this and the hundreds and hundreds of other positive reviews like these grab it anyway and if you dont like it get a refund from steam before you hit the 2 hour mark that and theres also a short demo on the official website a very easy way to make sure that 1hr of good lighthearted and feelgood unless you dont want it to be entertainment is right for you"

Terraria,"first off let me just mention that i loved Terraria back when it was released a twodimensional minecraft with tons more unique creatures and biomes not to mention unique bosses for different sections of the worldnow we see this beautiful casual gaming masterpiece we know as starbound much like Terraria but on a much much larger scale it may not have as many predesigned creatures and the procedurally generated ones may not be much to talk about either but when combined with the variation of the different worlds landscapes and scenery procedurally generated or not they fit in very nicely with the worlds around you there are many more block types most of which share a theme with other blocks if put together correctly you could even create a style completely different from that of the rest of the game the bosses are okay in a way they feel like your average boss in Terraria quite tough when you get to it possibly even inspiring during your first time fighting it but once you beat them once its like riding a bicycleand although the gameplay is solid addictive and most importantly fun i will admit that what really caught my attention when i started playing this game was the character customization whether it be via the character creator cosmetic items found ingame or a combination of the two and this leads in to another topic of discussion roleplay im quite into it and believe me when i say that this game is bursting with potential in terms of roleplay the game has a linear storyline with nonlinear gameplay allowing the player to complete the game at their own pace or simply choose not to complete the game at all with this in mind the player may choose to complete the game in order to get it out of the way or simply not do anything and stop tracking esthers quests if that furthers their concentration on whatever activities they may be pursuing such as roleplay building a colony exploring or any combination of thosenow if youll excuse me i have an appointment to kick big apes in about half an hour so enjoy the game and its future updates this game is definitely recommended by me and earns my seal of approval which doesnt really mean much and is only meant to emphasise my fondness for this game"

The_Darkness_2,"the darkness released early february 2012 and was a game that didn ' t receive much advertising or player generated hype The_Darkness_2 follows the story jackie estacado a mob boss who inherits a peculiar ability which is wielding the darkness the game uses cell shading similar to borderlands which compliments the game world well the gameplay is quite original and lets you " quadwield " which basically means you can wield a gun in each hand while also controlling your two darkness demon arms the controls feel a bit fiddly when using a mouse and keyboard if you own a controller i would recommend using that instead this game has some of the most gruesome kills i have ever seen in a game using your demonic arms you can rip your enemies in half slice of their head or even pull out an enemy ' s spine from his butt the list goes on the single player campaign took me about 6 hours on my first play through and left me wanting more not because the game was bad but because it was so darn good there is also a coop campaign which was fun to play with friends but got boring very quickly in summary i really enjoyed this game and its unique gameplay but found it was bit to short"
The_Community,"this game saved my long distance rekationship and continues to be regularly plastered across my social networks to the annoyance of friends if you are kinda interested just play it i loved it so much ive bought at least three times to get my friends on board as well its easy to do when its 3 on sale and you get two copies to give away if you buy it as a gift building your own contraptions is wonderful ludicrous fun and The_Community mods and developer updates mean there is always something new to do this is a labor of love from an experienced developer and it showsthe three main modes are puzle solve a puzzle contraption press play and see what others made and create where i make my musical animal themed death traps The_Community is great and always building something new thats cool so theres something for every onethe game has also been modded to heck by others if you want to get mega creative within the engine1010 would play angry birds with cats again"

Men_Of_War,"the game is very cheap and fun but it doesnt add much in terms of features compared to the original Men_Of_War the skirmish missions are boring and repetitive and the multiplayer is exactly the same wait 30 minutes to get a tigerii except that online multiplayer actually works the main reason to get this game over others is because the multiplayer actually works outside lan and the modding community"
Undertale,"Undertale caught me completely off guard as someone who enjoys a traditional rpg and a story rich game with so much hidden lore and a great soundtrack i thought id give it a go to be honest i wasnt expecting muchthis game however is easily one of the greatest games i have ever played and its truly deserving to be ranked high in the all time greatsthe charm the humour the puzzles the story the finale oh dear lord the finalei cant stop thinking about it the philosophical nature of the game the various pathways to take the music the fleshed out characters you genuinely care aboutits all somehow very beautifully tied together in this 46 hour gameyoull be replaying this game just like i did and i imagine youll see gaming and the medium in general in completely different ways1010 without a doubt in my mind"

The_Community,"with the recent series of issues like connection errors poorly balanced weapon parts and the game crashing randonmly plaguing loadout it is now clear that the game was nowhere near ready for release and couldve benefitted from a longer and more extensive beta test which wouldve allowed for all of the games features to be fully added and optimisedadding onto this the developers could communicate more with The_Community about any critical events like region shutdowns rather than just spontaneously shutting the regions down without informing The_Community and suffer from subsequent backlashall in all avoid this disastrous mess until theyre resolvedalso i couldnt save this as an edit to my previous review"

Evolve,"40 hours into the game i can say thisark survival Evolved is one of the most brutal and unforgiving survival games ive ever played and i cant get enoughthe game never holds your hand and walks you through it you are thrust into this deadly world in which you must learn the ropes as fast as you canthe game had a few issues on early access relief which is to be expected but the devs have worked tirelessly to fix this and it is a game i would recommend to any fan of the survival game genre"

Terraria,"magicite is an awesome side scrolling game its sort of like Terraria but not so miney and open world like it is an awesome game with a beatiful sound track and is worth the 10 it would be better if the spawns were different and there were a lot more options but right now it is still seriously cool i cant wait for more updates and new features one of which i hope is a bigger inventory"

The_Community,"its one of my favourite all time games and favourite mmo of all time the superhero storyline and theme is very appealing to my personal preference and the combat hack slash system is amazing for an mmo its simply yet can be sophisticated too if you learn all the powers and fighting combos you can put together your online fighting style and combat technique to destroy all opposing forces a lot of people slam the game for all types of reasons but people need to understand no game is perfect and not every aspect of the game will appeal to you this is one of very very few games where 99 of everything in the game appeals to me and makes me want to delve into the game 247 the only downfalls to the game imho is the leveling cap level 30 is very low in my opinion and since i have played since launch i would have hoped that it would have been increased to level 50 at least by now thus adding much more content and storyline to the game the dlcs are ok and some of it was just what i was hoping for but are money grabbing dlcs in other peoples opinions but when you love this game as much as i do i dont mind it at all and will support developers till the end of this games life ive already maxed out and done everything possible in dcuo on the psn network and have recently migrated over to the pc version to start again it shows just how much i love this game and am willing to put in hundreds of dollars again into the game to support developersthe powers in the games could be further externded if possible and more tactical battles amongst pve and pvp would be great too im hoping the game will be expanded over time and more content will be added to bring back veteran players and bring in more new players as well for that to happen the f2p system needs to be looked at again as most people have deemed the game as a p2w game it is somewhat but minimal yet its still enough to throw people off the game and slowly kill The_Community i would love to work aside the soe developers to offer suggestions test new content and help expand the dcuo game overall from day one i have had hopes that it would be expanded and content added on a regular basis to rival games like wow to me it has the potential and should have treaded carefully in doing so but now its too late for that but it still has time to make a 360 degrees turn around and still become one of the best mmos out there the metacritic score of 72100 is very low in my opinion and should have scored much closer to 80 and even 8590 but i believe that the level 30 cap and slow and small amount of content added over the years had hindered its progress and made The_Community much smaller than it should have been if good content and level cap raised happened earlier on the game would would have been much more known and better ranked its direct rival marvel has a much higher metacritic review score and it is a good game but i still believe what dcuo offers is still is just as good if not better i have had ideas in my mind about dcuo and what could be added to the game to make it much better and bring back its player base and even bring in more players i have emailed the soe about it and gotten no reply and believe its fallen on deaf ears andor the team has given up on dcuo or but it on thr back burner because they believe the potential the game had is long gone when it first became f2p it pulled in 100k new accounts soe should have used that opportunity to build upon the amazing the game they already had and add content accordingly so the new players could see how amazing dcuo really is and what theyve been missing out on but sadly i believe it was all done as a ploy to grab as much money as they can to base future dlc projects upon the amount of players and funds coming into their account thats where i think soe went most wrong instead of listening to the player base and adpting to the f2p system they implemented they went on how much money they could make and didnt take the communities opinions and suggestions seriously or at all in most cases to finish up on my review for now i still think dcuo is an amazing game and definitely recommend to everyone that loves mmos hack slash type of games rpgs dc universe and a mostly friendly community base the game has some flaws and drawbacks but no game is perfect but imho this game comes closest to being a perfect game in my eyes the majority of its content is very appealing to my personal preferences and keeps me very intrigued and wanting to constantly play every free moment i get i have a ton of suggestions ideas and concepts that couldwould make the game amazing and hugely expansive without much work necessary but whether someone from soe reaches out or even cares enough about its own game to do so i will only have to wait and see i have contacted them twice already in recent times with no reply or acknowledgment at all that they have received my email so i assuming their response team is either lacking in personnel or just cant be bothered i hope dcuo will continue to expand and soe looks to add an expansion pack as rumors were swirling when dcuo was at its peak but since then there has been nothing but mediocre dlc packs good or poor as they may be we need more i would love for an expansion that would raise level cap and introduce a new main storyline to dcuo it would be amazing to see and i could gurantee it will bring back alot of veterans and even bring in new players to the game as they see the development team are still working on the game and actively adding more and better content as it is right now the latest content added are very small and lazylike not much hype or even amazment about them seems like a small team is only left to deal with dcuo and it is very saddening in my eyes and heart i had wished and still do for dcuo to be around for at least another 5 years with active excellent content being added all the possible storylines are already there in the dc comics and just needs to be integrated into dcuo i dont see how hard that can be and how much amazment it would bring to true dc fans and dcuo fans ill give soe a free ideasuggestion on a possible future expansion to further dcuo and its content and gameplay take the dcuo universe to the universeliterallybrainiac came to uslets now take the battle to him and his home giving the opportuinty to even explore the green lanterns galaxy the remains of the planet kryptonthere is so much more that can be added and expanded from that alone enough to create an expansion that would be mind blowing and amaze the die dc fans and dcuo fans if this were somehow to materialize i would further support dcuo and soe and make sure to do my part in helping spreading the word about the expansion and if given the opportuniy even help out with testing suggestions or anything i can be of help with if soe were to approach and ask me to help i would be a great ambassador for dcuo my love for the game knows no bounds and i just wish for its success to be limitless and never ending please soe heed my word and suggestions and do whats best for us dcuo fans i will forever be grateful and dont want to see dcuo end up a dead community where i am running around with a few people trying the game and leaving not long after because of the dead player base its already saddening to see the same players over and over and no new people or veterans but im sure an expansion and marketing and awarness project would bring dcuo back to life again to the peaks of mmo history and amazement that its destined to be it should be rivaling wow wow has no real rival and i thought dcuo had that potential with its already rich history of lore and stories that are already out there how amazing would it be to play it with your own created hero 9710 almost perfect"

Portal,"this game is a great thirdperson button masherbeatemup that includes many different cleaver and satisfying puzzles to advance to different stages these puzzles include the use of jumpinggliding explosives grappling hooks slowing time and Portals the first part of the game you will be also doing a few cool arenas with different objectives such as aerial kills and protecting zombiesbosses are really fun and have really cool mechanics if you liked raiding it wow i would defiantly recommend thisthere are only a few bad things i can say about this game i found some with lots of crashing and buggy achievementshand ins you may also require a controller as it is a port"
Portal,"this game is very enjoyable for a little sitdown in the afternoon the puzzles are fun and some are a little hard but when you get them you feel good and that is a great feeling it has some bugs and issues the music in this game is amazing 1010 i saw alot of people hating on the voice actor and i feel bad for him because i actually enjoyed his voice alot the plot twist is amazing and the fast pased intence monents are fun expecially the one where you only have 60 seconds to escape i loved that all in all i really like the game and i admit its not living up to Portal2 but this game is still fun but would be better if you didnt have to purchase it kinda heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit 710"

The_Community,"before review notice played about 100200 hours on the browser before the steam release and am only just now getting round to this review because i havent quite been bothered enoughbegin review p positive this game is great if only i could end it like that but there is so much more to say the game itself is like if insurgency and battlefield had a child which decided to become free no mum this is my art to begin with The_Community is great at least in australiaoceania ive only encounted a few toxic squeakers and have made it my person mission to eliminate them repeatedlythe guns are really fluid and i like the semirealistic take the developers have taken on with most rifles and smgs requiring 23 bullets to killthe maps are fun to play and encourage teamwork and make for some great moments with or without friends new guns every month or so negative optional buyin credits of some sort really quite optional as mentioned before pretty much every gun does 23 bullet kills snipers obviously lessometimes struggle to actually get into the game keeps saying installing plugin please wait for about 10 minutes but as mentioned before once you get into the game you can easily forgive itwell thats pretty much it hope this helped you make a decision in the end though its free its fun and a good time waster 57 would spend 20 minutes writing a review for again"
Dota_2,"this is going to be a mixed review however i will recommend it for experienced or veteran moba players if you are starting out in the moba scene this is not really the game for you sorry its simply just not polished enough for people beginning in the world of mobasi dont have a whole lot of experience with this game so far but i have clocked literal hundreds of hours on RIRE and Dota_2 so i do have moba experience positives personal courier system a really interesting idea that i think works well and helps focus the combat on killing heroes and creepsminionsbrawlers from now on will be referred to as brawlers and not on looking out for couriers to earn some extra gold recipe system a really cool idea that allows you to change the components that makeup a recipe thus giving you different stats but still what the weapon is supposed to do pets another interesting idea that provides a little bonus for your hero and arent too overpowered or take away from the obverall experience lasthit system playing and looking at the demovideos of strife it is obvious that they have purposely designed this moba to minimise toxicity between players not only through community like RIRE but also through core game components and mechanics i feel that this works really well and benefits everyone constant stream of heroes this is both a positive and a negative which will be brought up later not much to be said the more the merrier right waiting for loaders when waiting for other loaders you are placed in the game your herochampion can not move but they can level their chosen skill and purchase items from the shop i like this as it makes waiting for others a little less boringnegatives towers i think every review has covered this towers are horrendously overpowered seriously in league or dota its possible to tower dive for about half a minute or so to secure an enemy kill but in strife the moment you attack and enemy hero under their tower you are targeted this is ok but the towers hit like a truck for the whole game fully levelled people are still scared of those damn things this needs to be fixed asap constant stream of heroes unfortunately the constant stream of heroes is also a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth with a large amount of new heroes the ones already in the game can not be refined fast enough and there are some glaringly obvious heroeschampions with op abilities and such penalty for leaving you cant play another game until the one you left is over yup thats itthere are probably a whole bunch of things that ive missed about this game but on the whole i enjoy it as a refreshing take on the moba scenemisc things no au servers this obviously only affects au players but a constant ping of 200300 is kinda annoying no all chat i just cant find it maybe it doesnt exist probably due to the antitoxic community take the team are going foroverall to conclude i would say that this game is what it is early access beta its a pretty cool and new take on moba but its still early access and needs some or a lot of work if you enjoy mobas and know your way around them give this one a shot i think youll like it for what it is if you are new to mobas and are looking for one to start off with give this one a miss until you have more experience simply because i think youll have a better experience with other mobasnow this is all my exerience with the game with a measly 10 hours under my belt thanks for reading guysglitch"
Super_Meat_Boy,"though simple the art style and animations are absolutely beautiful having this helps when youre staring at the same thing for how many hours due to dying so much the soundtrack compliments the game as well and though freaking difficult you still wan na play more and morethe controls are simple and not complicated whatsoever with very few buttons youre able to do a range of diferent attacks though i have to admit on multiple occassions i had attempted to say just do a quick punch though what happened was a quick dash ultimately leading to my death whether it be into a pile of spikes or off the ledge it just adds to the difficulty of the game though usually is no problemthere a different factors of this game that remind me of Super_Meat_Boy and both games are great got heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit at both but nevertheless theyre still really fun id recommend this to anyone up for a challenge youre going to die whilst playing this game a lot but no matter how many times you may or how angry you get its all worth it if youre a sucker for platformers definitely pick this up have fun dying"

Portal,"fantastic game wonderfully designed to match the features of Portal 2 but makes it extremely more difficult while the story is definitely set out well and virgil the new core is a joyful addition to the game this can often be undercut by the difficulty of the game as it will often take vigorous methodical work to even get close to an answer for a course that is something you wouldnt even consider as it goes against the puzzle solving mechanics of the original two gameshowever the voiceacting interactions with virgil and the very pleasant old timey feel of the game helps to push you through it and at a total of zero dollars makes for an enjoyable journey through the old Portal universe that youve been missing for four years i would definitely recommend it for those whove been waiting for Portal 3 as it may be the closest well ever get but maybe not for those with short patience as it is definitely a game of hard thinkingthe ending is superb it has a beautiful soundtrack virgil is a splendid character to take you on the adventure and in the end the game just feels like a new Portal game it is fantastically well done and fantastically difficult"
Dota_2,"deep and complex fun and rewarding despicable and anger indusing these are the things that Dota_2 is and frankly it wouldnt be better any other way"

Besiege,"its come to the point where people see the red flag of early access and decide to skip conditioned to do so by a large variety of games that show promise but are eventually abandoned by the developers to rot in a pool of graphical glitches and unfinished stories being one of those people my initial reaction was to pirate this game expecting something brief not worth my time instead i found a thoroughly enjoyable experience that led me to actually buy the game and play through the levels i had so far completed againill just say it now i think its worth buying Besiege for what it currently has to offer a 7 price tag is insanely cheap for a game that i would expect to cost 15 or 20 while currently there are limited levels available there really is an infite amount of time one can spend on them if you simply rush through the game completing each level as fast as possible youll likely be done in under 2 hours dependant upon your proficiencyhowever youd be doing the game and yourself a great injustice this game is not just about completing simple tasks its about completing them in the most wacky and roundabout ways you can imagine youll find yourself restarting levels to try new ideas perhaps to beat your time or minimum amount of blocks used or perhaps just to see if itll worknow that ive praised the game heres what i dont like about it keeping in mind these will probably all be solved in future updates1 lack of tutorialswhile the game is relatively simple there are no real tutorials to teach you what to do if youre clever enough youll be able to figure out how to do basic functions by yourself steering flying etc and the game is all about building testing failing building again however some basic tutorials to point players in the right direction could solve a lot of ragequits2 no multiplayercome on developers this is the obvious thing to do with the game you add a multiplayer battle arena where you let people fight to the death with their machines perhaps limiting their number of blocks or which blocks can be used maybe you could even add other multiplayer gamemodes like races or castle sieges to me this seems like the obvious direction to take the game in because itll be awesome and will encourage people to buy rather than pirate3 the controlsthe controls for moving around the camera seem straightforward yet somehow i always have trouble adjusting to them im not sure why everything works the way it should but i always end up being far too zoomed out when trying to look at something from underneath4 the lagthis is likely an inherent issue with the engine and not something easily fixable but i thought it would be worth mentioning ive got a pretty high end gaming pc but on levels with a lot of enemies and a very large machine i do find the game to lag momentarily when i test my machine keep in mind ive only encountered this in specific scenarios and only for a few seconds before it settlesas you can see these issues are all relatively minor and will likely be fixed in the future even if they werent id still recommend this game buy it"

The_Community,"ive been playing unturned for a short period of time but i have to say that it is looking very promising as ive only played the free version of the game im yet to see the features that are available when playing the premium version when you first open the game youre given the opportunity to create a character there are a variety of customisation options available however some of which are only unlocked with the premium version of the game once passed the character customisation stage which can be edited later anyway you can choose between a singleplayer multiplayer and tutorial option being a man that likes to learn for himself i reframed from playing the tutorial but for the sake of reviewing unturned i did the tutorial gives you a basic rundown of the controls movement combat and driving simple but helpful then i decided to jump straight onto singleplayer unturned gives you two options of maps to play on pei which is your basic postapocalyptic map with buildings and towns and arena a difficult map which places you in an arena like area with nothing but the forest around you i decided to play on the pei map first once spawned i realised that you start off with nothing and i literally mean nothing you dont even spawn with clothes on the spawning in unturned is random so i was spawned near a walled off area which i later found was a military base i fought my way through the base and gathered a few supplies including a backpack handgun and suppresor and a map of the whole of pei while in this menu i discovered a skills menu which can be upgraded by earning eperience though killing zombies and a crafting menu which didnt make sense to me so i decided to leave it be judging from the map it seemed that pei was a large scale map that had many places to visit so i decided to visit the local town once i arrived i was greeted by a large horde of zombies i managed to pick off 5 of them with my handgun but i ran out of ammo and had to run for about 5 minutes before running upstairs into a house and dying because i got stuck in the tub this is the point where i decided i was bad at video games and also decided to play on the other ma arena once loaded it spawned me into an arena like area the areanwas surrounded by water ans there were tall rocks around me vaguely resembling stone henge and some supplies however due to the small inventory space i could only carry a small knife and three seed which i planted soon after i decided to venture out into the woods and i quickly got lost my hunger and thirst bars needed tending to so i decided to hunt some animals and quickly realised that the pigs i was chasing were very fast or that my player spent too much time writing a pointless review of a game that nobody will ever read so he gained a substancial amount of weight and decided not to go outside anymore i soon realised that the only way to satisfy these meters was to travel back to the spawn and harvest the seeds i planted earlier but i unsucessfully did so and died trying to find which way i came from then i decided to try out the multiplayer secion of the game but was unable to do so because i have no friends unturned is a great game however i do feel that playing with friends would give you a much different and better experience in contrast to playing by yourself unturned feels like a very basic version of dayz or games similar to this and this is not a bad thing unturned gives you a similar experience to these games but it expresses itself in a much different way this is mainly bue to the blocky artstyle of the game which much resembles games like roblox and minecraft unturned is the type of game that you could let your 7 year old brother play without getting into trouble by your mum for letting him play a violent video game but can still be played by the older demographic just the same to summarise this review i reccomed this game to anyone however get some friends whip up a server and play together and youll have a much better experience do i see potential in this game yes i do so long as the developers continue to work hard and listen to The_Community and take their ideas on boards as well as their own give unturned a try you wont be let down"

Evolve,"big alpha review i came into playing the big alpha for Evolve with low expectations i have never played a game thats in alpha before and expected a broken barely playabale piece of trash but i can pleasantly say that the alpha is surprisingly well polished the good stuff the gameplay is exciting i often find myself on my toes always alert for the monster has startled the birds icon i couldnt wait to spring into action with my team mates playing as the monster is just as exciting always on the prowl sniffing out your enemies as you devour the wildlife and become so powerful the hunters become the preythe classes the game provides assault trapper medic and support everyone has their own job and if one falls the hunters may find it difficult to survive the class system makes it important for teamwork to exist within the game making it a very good game to play with friendseven on low graphics had to turn it down due to optimization issues more on that later the game looks great enviroments are lush and the dark gloomy time setting makes the games atnosphere that much better the bad stuff ive read other reviews and forums and it seems that alot of people are having issues with the game even with powerful systems admitedly my system isnt top tier but its no scrap yard and i was having issues running the game on high to get a smooth enjoyable experience i had to turn the graphics down to low however i didnt expect much less it is in alpha after allthe loading times took along time i mean 1015 minutes long just to get into a bloody level i kept having audio issues gun sounds repeatedly going off when i wasnt firing etc quite irritating the conclusion its good its very goodfor an alpha you need to keep that in mind when playing something that isnt a full release the devs have already said they are continuing to add on to this game and have a very clean polished game out in febuaryi highly recomend this unfortunately i am writing this on the last day i will ofcourse try to get a couple more hours in so lets hope the full game is as pleasant as this"
Csgo,"counterstrike global offensive truly differs from the other modern aa shooters that are released prosCsgo has a variety of game modes that appeal to the general fan base of first person shooters such as deathmatch and arms race but keeps its core focus on the classic 5v5 diffuse mission that every counterstrike fan knows and lovesthe game encourages team tactics and cooperation between team mates which can be difficult due to the occasional prat who decides to wedge the bomb inbetween the car next to t spawn and a wall but when you dont have a team mate with the iq of a drooling two year old you can effectively develop stratergies that work with your team whether its full of strangers or some of your closest friends friendships are madethe mechanics of the game push a new player through a steep learning curve with difficult recoil control or making sure they stay fairly quiet both of these things can ruin first impressions but can easily be learnt and adapted to over timethere is a wide variety of maps with ocasional dlc coming out every season containing new maps and weapon skin casesconsthe valve anticheat doesnt seem to be working that well gabe now this may just be a personal issue seeing as the servers you autoconnect to depend on your region the oceanic reigon for yours truly but i constantly run in to people with obvious aimcheats wallcheats etc etc which really ruins the gamei got a ban for kicking too many people in previous gamesexcuse me i consider myself to be a pretty fair guy and i understand that not everyone can 4k clutch so i only vote to kick someone if theyre doing worse than a bot would or being a giant heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit in these cases these players were being tremendous knobs killing team mates throwing the bomb into unreachable places playing rap music down their microphone etc therefore i the teams i was playing on came to a mutual agreement to kick the players i just think the reason for the ban is a load of cackaah yes skin cases now im not really considering this a con as its not valves fault for making me spend that much money tt only open casescrates if you have the money you will regret itdespite the couple of negative things i had to say i give counterstrike a whole heartedly 910 if a game can make me as angry as this one can it means it deserves a pretty solid rating i recomend this game to any one thinking of getting it but with a warning this game is harder to learn than your average shooter dont go in with the mindset that youre going to wreck people in your first day you wont and thats good its just the beggining soldier"

Half_Life_2,"i originally had massive problems with running this game and plenty of others did as well in my frustration i wrote a negative review because of its near unplayable stateinterdimensional studios themselves admited and apologized that consortiums launch was horribly buggy and thankfully this is no longer the case with all their hard work and dedication to the project all bugs gamebreaking or just weird are now gone i intended on fully editing this review if the problems were solved and now they havei can best describe consortium as a mix of the original star trek and mass effect with the shooting mechanics and engine of Half_Life_2 and if that mix doesnt sound good to you or you didnt like any of these examples then its hard to recommend however if youre looking for epic 1st person scifi romp with an emphasis on story dialogue player choice story and wrapped up with some decent shooting mechanics look no furtherconsortium is also the first in a trilogy and only lasts about 10 hours at the most however it never feels too short and im very excited for whats to come the story is brilliantly written the game has marvelous presentation and the characters throughout the adventure are interesting and their dialogue throughout it is well done combat is a bit like an old school shooter mixed with halflife 2 which i find works well enough but its hardly the focus of the gameno the focus of consortium is the interactions between you and the other crew aboard the ship with multiple dialogue choices and the dire consequences for most of them and interdermentional studios have done it brilliantly even with my previous frustration at launch its obvious how far consortium has come and the master edition truly is worth anyones time especially for only 20 this is the type of game ive been wanting ever since mass effect came out and it certainly doesnt disappoint"

Metro_2033,"based on the book by dmitry glukhovsky and i have to say the games is a beaststory is pretty good and very interesting following the concept of you destroying the so called dark ones being a post nuclear disaster game you will be killing lots of mutants and encounter communist enemys and even fight the 4th reich the problems with the game are sadly bad pc optimizing and a somewhat weird and not so clear ending that makes you ask alot of questions about what just happened overall i would say Metro_2033 is a really good game if you ignore the optimizing and other little problems and i say it is a game worth buying it is only 99EUR also the sequel for this game called metro last light is coming out this year on may 17 for people living in europe and i cant wait for it"

Portal,"killing floor is one of the best coop games on steam there i said it it even rivals Portal 2 and day z in my mind for 199 it might be a bit overpriced but lower the price to 1499 or 99 and youve got yourself a great deal 6 player coop in a wave based system was a great idea that sounds a little like call of duty zombies but i assure you this is a completly different expirence most maps are around 9 waves long with a 10th boss wave to finish the game through out the game you can buy guns melee wepons grenades and body armor but on the higher difficulty levels it seems you never have enough cash to buy what you want which means going without that badass shotgun or that samurai sword for yet another roundfinal words if you have some steam friends get the boys or girls together for some great zombie killing"

Evolve,"i think this game is brilliant i have a very cheap joystick subpar cpugraphics and this game runs beautifully and looks really good for an older game the realism is perhaps a little behind something like flight simluator x but the trade off is that this game has military simulation with it which means guns bombs tanks tactics strategy and the 1946 theme and music is so awesomely presented to be honest i only know my stuff when it comes to cessna f15 f18 high end planes but this is a really nice interactive way for me to see how planes Evolvedjust make sure when you download this game take off gl graphics i nearly facepalmed this game when graphics were spiking out everywhere and cheap luckily thats just the default you can change it to a better one thankfully forget what its called"

Dota_2,"it is quite a difficult game to initially grasp the storeshop and the secret storeshops are really quite aan interesting touch that until you get used to the game are quite annoying the concept of donkeys bringing you gear is really nice it enables you to stay in lane longer then most other mobas which is good i didnt particularly enjoy having to buy town scrolls to teleport to my base id rather press b wait and bam home but i guess it makes Dota_2 stand out my cs game is particularly good in pretty much every moba from league of legends to smite to awesomenauts to super monday night combat and in these games if you dont cs all to well or even dont get kills as long as you dont die its possible to stay in the game whereas dota gold collecting automatically takes a some time and csinglast hitting minions is quite hard but gets you around 50 gold which is really a pain as if you dont cs or get kills you fall behind everyone else most shop items are rather expensive and that is purely based on the knowledge i have from other mobas i would consder myself a pretty good moba player but i dont know what it is about Dota_2 that i find myself not doing as much damage as the other guy as a character that looks like a carryranged carry it takes some time to get used to and it takes some time a long time to understand each characters ability set and know how to play around itid give this game 710 would recommend"
The_Community,"at the time of writing this review i just finished the game about 30 minutes ago now when i finished it i felt amazing and this game makes you feel amazing both with its story which i wont spoil and gameplay but i finished it in 14 hours which i didnt have that much a problem with exept for the fact that i finished dustan elysian tale the day before in also 14 hours and that was made by 1 person which got me thinking thinking about why theres such a similarity between game completion rate and such a big difference between development however this greatly redeemed itself when at the end of the credits it said that i completed 2 of its entirety now the gameplay is very good from perfect platforming alliteration to a well made thirdperson shooter this game trully makes you feel like a badass and at times a genius when you finish a puzzle from a tomb the only problem i had with the gameplay was the qtes quick time events which got repetitive at times and made me die too many times another problem i had was The_Community for the multiplayer the problem it didnt exist noone plays multiplayer so i cant really talk about it much to conclude tomb raider is an amazing single player game with the problem of annoying qtes and a nonexistant multiplayer community i recommend it for the single player not the multiplayer"

Evolve,"visually stunning and interesting of course but that can only carry a game so far exploring becomes tedious and dull after a while as the puzzles dont really Evolve much beyond the flipping perspective mechanic and the areas are connected in a confusing mazelike fashion that just left me feeling unsure of where to go and not really motivated to bother methodically searching around maybe this just isnt my sort of game but i cant recommend it"

Tf2,"ok so firstly if you are here for Tf2 items then do not buy this game the money isnt worth the Tf2 items and when you buy the game it takes forever to get the items secondly if you are looking for fun look somewhere else this game has low graphics and boring characters poker can be played on the internet for freewhen you are aiming to get Tf2 items in this game you need to play poker for hours and hours and you must win in order to obtain the items in this game you must play poker and beat the other 4 players in order to win there are 5 players in total yourself max strong bad the heavy and tycho in order to win items you must keep playing games until you encounter someone coughing up some gear but you need to defeat that player and if anyone else defeats the player you lose the item the items take forever to encounter and you have a low chance of winning the item it take several hours or maybe even days to obtain them all i have encountered items before but never received themthis game is not recommended unless you have fine skills at poker and you are desperate for these items it is an absolute waste of money if you are trying to get the items 410chop2014"
The_Community,"this game had so much potential on the day it was created with alot of fanbased projects it really got The_Community going when it was first released and this game had a lot of potential trove is basically world of warcraft and minecraft the concept of mmorpg grinding is still there and there is the block building breaking and making idea implemented in the game as well trove started to become a game loved by The_Community and trion decided to add in more pay to win options in every single update this is very true and trion will probably never change it after you zoom in to about 50 hours of the game a few hundred dollars can change you from early game to late game their ingame purchase benefits are crazy and a few dollars spent makes up for a few days of grinding major in game benefits and boosts such as patron which is like membership costs irl money and increases bonus stats by a crazy amount however trove has tried to conceal the fact that they are money hungry beasts and added in a feature where each day has a different bonuses so free to play players can grind this bonus doubled and increased if you have patron making patron an extremely game changing thing however although pay to win is a major problem free to play players can still thrive if you have hundreds of hours to burn monthly to get to about mid game trion is only asking you to grind your soul out it really isnt much of a big deal note the sarcasm once you get to about mid game you make very little progress daily even if you play a lot tge new level update to make the maximum level from 20 to 30 is so grindy now all the pay to win problems have been covered i can now talk about the gaming bits of the game as i said before this game has the basic concepts of a fun mmorpg with dungeons and raids to do this game doesnt really require much teamwork but farming in big groups would be ideal and easier the hardest raids can be soloed sometimes and there are hardly any boss mechanics a game like world of warcraft or rift has raids and dungeons that requires strategic battle plans such as tanking healing pulling aggro dps kiting timing and positioning although tanking is required in the game and dps is as well it doesnt really feel as exciting as an actual raid or dungeon where you feel like you have contributed to the dps charts a carry can easily be invited into your raid and they can just one hit the bosses extremely quickly after the tutorial of the game there are hardly any more quests to complete which makes it boring becuase all you do in the game is shadow tower raids and dungeons adding in questing would really make the game alot stronger than it is and it really needs to be for a pay to win game adding a questline would put more excitement and make the game more interesting the biggest power rank booster in the game are gems which at a certain point of the game is extremely hard to get in lots of amounts to progress onto the worlds you either sell your soul to the demon or spend 30 trion really needs to rethink about how the game will be updated the amount of hours you will spend grinding on this game will become unbelievable if you want to proceed to the end game stages and levels dont touch this game and want to goto end game in a few months unless youre allowed to drain mums credit cardwhen i say it like this im not even joking just play this for fun its meant to be fun for the first 100 hours"

Portal,"honest reviewfirst thing is first i have played path of exile for longer than my hours will show for as i have multiple accounts that have been usedforgottenmuleetc but steam is my main use of the game roughly 100 hours is more accuratewhat i can say honestly with path of exile is that it really gives you a feeling of satisfaction when you have built a design of a character put it together over time and it works theorycrafting became a job title and a hobbie spending hours on end simply coming up with a character that would win the game without even the currency to make it happenso what have a done in the gamejust about every piece of endgame content i am still chasing a deathless uber atziri kill however i have been close on many instancesprosendless character builds it comes down to just how what knowledge you have of the game mechanicspassive tree to get lost inguild community great game to play solo but with others is just on another levelhas softcore and hardcore gameplaynew leagues constantly released this means a new ladder leaderboardplayer hideout to showcase your effortsleveling up crafting masters to increase your crafting optionsover 100 achievementsgreat ways to trade in game and through poetrade 31052016this is not a diablo clone and it really holds its own as a fresh and original gameconsdying in hc can be frustrating crafting rng can make you feel very unlucky at timesmain chat can be full of random trash talkers not alwaysoverallso why do i still playthere is still soo much i can get out of the game and when you least expect it something crazy might drop item or currency that will change your gameplay and style but the satisfying feeling i get fast clearing high level maps at a chance of gaining loot thats so rare it makes you freak out rush to pop it in your inventory Portal to your hideout and logout and pause yourself for a few moments to think i just found a mirror"

The_Community,"as far as reccomendations go its hard to say because while i personally enjoy a challenge it certainly isnt the most refined game if you buy this game expect bad fps even for typically good pcs im running 6gb of ram and my overclocked cpu running 40mghz and i only run it on simple settings and the occasional glitch in graphics and performance if you can put up with that though its an excellent game the best way to look at it is like minecraft but more realistic at least in vanilla mode personally i havent tried any of the modded servers or the official servers because the reviews ive read about the online community disturb me a little so ive stuck to small servers if i had to give an honest review of this game id have to put up two reviews once you get past the jumpy fps and occasional glitch the game itself is solid as a rock for the game id say 9510 just need to iron out the wrinkles as for the second review The_Community while i have heard of bad players the players that i have met online have been really good so although not knowing what other players are like id give The_Community rating at about a 7 or 8 out of 10 just to try and compensate for my lack of knowledge"

Garrys_Mod,"its a top of the job film maker it has earned itself a high reputation recently its easy to use once you get the hang of it after a few practices if you are really devoted to create your own videosalthough you are going to need a powerful decent computerlaptop to run and save your work with this program considering you need at least 15 gb of space and a high graphics card because less powerful computers arent going to stand a chance the program would still work but the chances of it crashing is a lot likely to happen and loading assets takes a lot while longer overall the quality and graphics are very high moving props and skeletons uses a similar system to Garrys_Mods bone manipulator but slightly more sophisticated and plus this software is produced by valve and inturn they use it to create their videos tutorials are notebly separate from the program so an internet search is required to find them i recommend this software if your computerlaptop is powerful enough to tolerate it"

The_Community,"dayz is probably one of the most played openworld zombie games to date it was one of the most successful mods in history and although the standalone isnt looking so crashhot now its definetely headed in the right direction my advice would be to buy this game right now even if your not really happy with the current buildi only say this because the difference between the mod and this game is vastly different and as such the developers are trying to take this in a more realistic direction this wontbe agreeable to everyone of course and sometimes i think theyve taken it too far and retracted from the games appeal despite what i know theyre aiming for i think they have to consider that this is just a game and shouldnt be crafted to a point where The_Community no longer enjoys it nevertheless id recommend it time and time again as a great away to pass the hours with friends through blood sweat and tears usually in that order"
Tf2,"the only reason this game doesnt have a higher metascore is because it was reviewed when it was first released in flashback articles youll see prevoulsy scorning critics giving it 10s because its improved so much maps have been added crates like Tf2 weapon skins so many community contributions map tweaks gameplay upgrades new game mode the list continues this game needs more players all noobs welcome the community can teach you the tools of the trade even if uyoure hopeless d have fun on csgo deffinitely worth anyones time in my case 400 hours of time right now anyway"

Portal,"portal 2 is a fun and interactive game that challenges you to think outside the box obviously its the sequal to the original Portal so graphics and ui have been increased significantly you play as a test subject for aperture laboratories where they test the potential of beings for the future on the journey you go through many tests set by glados genetic lifeform and disk operating system while observing the environment trying to find a way out of the facility overall it is a great game for anyone looking for a puzzling journey full of surprises"

Tf2,"id have to give Tf2 a 1010 much much improved to its older brother tfc enjoyable characters gameplay and much much much replay value no wonder ive racked up 600hrs of it"
Tf2,"all ive got to say about this game is that it is probably one of the funniest first person shooters out there right next to Tf2 well that isnt all i have to say if your looking for a game with almost unlimitless types of guns this is the game for you and with the weapon slots you unlock through the game you can have a sniper rifle rocket launcher pistol and shotgun on you at the same time without making you slow like most other games would plus the fact that some guns when you reload them you throw them away into an enemy and it explodes so to sum it all up great game"
Team_Fortress_2,"the formula of Team_Fortress_2 is the same as that established the original forget the traditional matches deathmatch in which wins one committing the highest number of deaths here it is essential to work together each player will be part of blue or red which tends to contain the same number of participants in team games that are balanced if a team has more players than the other they will automatically redistributed in the next game for now those are two game modes the traditional capture the flag it is here that a briefcase containing secret files which must be stolen from the base of the opposing team and taken to the headquarters of his team and taking control points the latter sutra some variations as one in which the team must defend their area before the time runs out before the opposing team to dominate or that both teams capture control points simultaneously and defend their own territory the simplicity of the game makes it more enjoyable and dynamic allowing the player to stay tuned to the nearest opponents and not goofing die to capture a control point for example just stay on marked until a bar fills area the more units of the same team the faster the point will be taken at times like this strategy is what counts the team that is more balanced with characters of attack defense and support working cooperatively tends to win the game more easily why is this important communication between the players either via voice and through instant messaging an unforgettable teamas previously mentioned there are nine distinct character traits they are the scouts fast but vulnerable incendiary able to put your enemies on fire breaker equipped with grenade launchers and landmines crude the toughest of all but also the slowest engineer builder sentry guns doctor who restores the energy of the other players sniper able to inflict critical damage to long distances and spy who has the ability to masquerade as any other character facilitating infiltrationeach character has an arsenal of weapons itself plus unique abilities like double jump or scout the power of invisibility spy all this allows each team to prepare their own defense and combat tactics the possibilities are virtually endless depending on the map however certain tactics are more efficient than othersfor more frantic action that is you can get acquainted with Team_Fortress_2 in a matter of minutes a low learning curve is a big advantage especially for players less accustomed with online games simply connect to a server and taking action without those screens customization and configuration explanatory videos help you understand each objective without major complications it is an ideal game for any time either for short or long and uncompromising and competitive matches of course who does not have much skill with games of first person shooter and get into a server full of experienced players which can be common in Team_Fortress_2 eventually finishing matches with the score reset which can be quite frustrating at this point he lacks training areas or specific servers for beginners cartoon in game shapethe animated feature the incredibles was clearly an inspiration for the team of artists from valve which seem not hide admiration for cartoony and bold characteristic also of the iron giant from the director of the pixar movie the visual design of the characters and cartoon perfectly combined with the uncompromising and fun proposal for Team_Fortress_2 the fighters are also provided for you the forward scout for example the most agile of all is young and slender while the gunner brute wielding a giant machine gun is frowning all move with a lightness and smoothness unparalleled revealing animation work technically perfect that owes nothing to the work of pixar all that style combined with the frantic action worthy cartoon makes the game even more fun than it was before the high degree of violence of the original was maintained leaving even more comical incessant battles regarding the sound part the game needs more songs aside from the main menu the action does not track soundtrack being restricted only to the sounds of bullets and explosives many taken from the own halflife 2 which unlike Team_Fortress_2 has a much more serious issue the contrast becomes inevitable because you would expect from a game with visual cartoon drawings are classic hanna barbera sound effects"
Tf2,"its Tf2 need i say anything else"
Terraria,"unturned is an entertaining game here give my opinion of the game unturned is a survival game like day z because youre a guy you have to build your house and collect things for their survival and the cities are infected zombies you need food drinks and antibiotics to reduce the detoxification detoxification increases when hit by a zombie the game is fun to play in multiplayer because having friends makes you share your items with others and has to use a lot of cooperation so that all players have things necessary to defend against waves of zombies when i started to survive in the game i thought it would be a game like rust minecraft Terraria etc but i found it different there are many more things to do and what matters most in this game is the way to be able to have enough things to survive from when you start to when you finish the path between the two is as much fun in this game never give up on the game as always will have something to help you succeed the concluion is that it is one of the best games that are survival and is in beta the game is complete when the probability of finding the most entertaining game that was in beta will be higher keep updating unturned having a good life"

The_Community,"not even worth playing anymore it has gone way to pay to win when i first started this it was actually viable i just recently came back and unless youre going to pay loads of then youre not going to get very far most trapsmonsters and other stuff you can get for your castle for defences are locked and youll need to either buy the infinite pack or unlock each one using ingame special currency which costs real and having to validate your castle is what annoys me the most since you have use your own hero to validate which means you have to clear your castle without dying if you die then it wont validate you can pay to get The_Community to validate your castle but that also costs because you can only use special ingame currency inorder for The_Community to validate it for you you can ask your clan to validate it for you if you can manage to get in one but almost all clans have requirements so goodluck with that you need around 500100 crowns for people to acutally accept you into a clan which takes a considerable amount of time and fustration since if you lose in any sort of way you lose crown and quite a lot of crowns depending on where you try to attack and people can plunder your castle so that also means you can still lose crowns even when youre offline or online unless you got loads of cash to throw at this game dont bother"

Csgo,"this game can be good at times dont get me wrong it can also be enjoyable and playing with friends is great too but there are some majour issues that need to be addressed for example for some reason and not just me when ever your ping starts to fck up so does your fps you can be running normally at ultra at 60fps on a 980 like me and then just randomly get fps drops that you think is just ping lag before you realise nope its your computer i know somebody with a 980ti that also has the same problem thats not the only problem for some reason i had these huge lights that were apearing out of no where and almost making me blind the pc au servers are also terrible at least there dedicated this time but still bad you can one round have the best ping and then next awful ping and my internet isnt even that bad and i have australian internet ahha the games killing system and aiming could also be improved doesnt help that im not that good of an aim RIRE but still after playing Csgo for example i can be doing well in that and finding that when i get killed its oh okay fair enough and when i get a kill well that was good in bo3 its like when you get killed omg what the fck hes hacking omg thats so heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t and when you get a kill no way i got that and thats just a few things to name its also very buggy and you can tell that it has been rushed either that or its just a bad console peasent to pc port i had high hopes for this game and im not impressed at all i did enjoy zombies though and found that enjoyable and is most likely keeping me from refunding it its just mp needs to be improved alot cheers"

The_Community,"one of few apocalypse survival games that truly grows from The_Community the dev works on this everyday and is always looking for feedback and opinions on how the game is shaped also constantly putting out strawpolls to The_Community and listens to usunturned is played how you want example if you only want pve you can select your server and if you want a pvp experience with your pve you can select pvp enabled on your server and yes you can host your own servers on your computerit starts out like many other apocalypse survival games you start out with your fists and 4 slots for your inventory you have a lot of places you can wander to when you spawn like a cabin camp small town military base and many more your main mission when you start is to grab a melee some food with drink and a backpack once youve acquired these necessities you may wish to find a gun if you want to pvp or you may want to collect seeds to start a farm or even start chopping down trees to make yourself a cozy place to spend the nightthe pvp system is great also server hosts can select if players can bring in loot from their server best for pvp or not be able to bring loot in best for pve immersion their is a leaning system so you can peek corners also you can also shoot out of cars but not from the drivers seat of course load some of your buddies in the trunk of your truck and do a hillbilly driveby if you wishthe towns are well structured for pvp also their are lot of cqc battles to be fought and also small hills for sniping but snipers can be easily flanked if you dont post up rightbase raiding is also important in pvp too people on public servers will build structured bases equipped with sniper pits plenty of windows and escape routes you must observe a players base and attack it strategically you never know how many players may be in therenow time to farm my crops and build my base i recommend you do so also"

The_Community,"great game and is definatlely worth playing but be careful you might get addicted other than this it is an amazing first person shooter where you can pick 1 of 9 classes all with different ways of playing and different strategies The_Community is also great you can trade and work your way up with items and a lot of other interesting things too my favorite thing to do is play saxton hale servers or prop hunt both of which are very carefully planned and thought out wellwell done to the steam develpoers1010"
Terraria,"wow soo much to say about this game where to start well for starters no matter how many other better games you find on steam skyrim the witcher wild hunt any other game you will never get as much enjoyment out of them as you will Terraria you will never beat the classics such as minecraft no matter how many times you tell yourself you dont like it anymore but tbh Terraria is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing amazing you think the producers of minecraft have it hard of course they do its a 3d game everythings difficult even tho Terraria is a 2d game it has so much more content including bosses weapons biomes enemies items npcs tools ores and a lot more like srrsly you think or minecraft then think of everything is has Terraria has it but about 5 times more especially items Terraria has like 50 times more items then minecraft minecraft just simply cant compete with Terraria you spawn into a randomly generated world with a shortsword pickaxe and an axe you find a tree chop it down make a house make some background walls so enemies cant spawn in there then with the rest of the wood a workbench some tools to mine better ores to make better weapons look at wiki or do it yourself spawn an easy boss and destroy it with the amazing new weapons you have scavenged and made collect its drops to save up copper silver gold platnium coins to buy unique items from npcs such as awesome weapons and humorous items to make your gameplay even more entertaining and just when you think its over a meteor lands you go find its location attempt to mine it without getting killed from burning to death or demolished by meteor heads use the meteor armor weapons and tools to go deeper underground to find and mine some gold once you have the gold you make ingots and gold armor and weapons get better weapons to go aall the way down to the underworld aka hell RIRE to mine some hellstone make a giant pathway thought the underworld kill a voodo demon and get a guide doll drop it in lava and summon the wall of flesh with multiple attempts to kill it you will then basically have a new game killing the wall of flesh unlocked hardmode harder enemies new bosses destroy the demon altars with the hammer the wall of flesh drops which spawns in new better stronger ores to mine anyway i highly recommend buying this game hours and hours of fun i just this game is amazing please buy this gametell all your friends about this gameget them to buy this gamebuy this game for themwhatever you can you need this game to end your sad little life and make it a good oneanyway take care"

Portal,"hablar de Portal es hablar de lo grande que puedes llegar con una secuela y la verdad es que creo que tiene un gran impacto en jugabilidad diseno y banda sonora que va de acuerdo con la tematica del juego al agregar un modo cooperativo para dos usuarios a traves de internet o a pantalla dividida en consolas es la incorporacion mas notable y llamativa no obstante esta no debe distraernos del hecho de que hay muchas novedades mas y tambien de enorme importancia la naraccion incluisicion de nuevo personajes y resolucion de puzzles y la hablidad de pensar al tener que pasar una camara de pruebas o completar logros lo cual es bueno ya que no es tanta la variedad de juegos que tengas rompecabezas en el y mas aparte la gran minoria los compra Portal 2 comienza de forma espectacular al inicio descubriremos que nada es lo que parece y que lo que en los instantes de apertura parece ser una aventura en la que caminaremos solos rapidamente recibe un golpe de suerte literal inesperados aliados y viejos conocidos como los enemigosla simpatia del juego se gana debido a que los dialogos que nos dan son doblados al espanol y con toques humoristicos bastante agradables el doblaje del juego es bastante bueno a mi parecer encaja perfectamente con los personajesrecuerda buscar objetos ocultos al finalizar las camaras pues puede que sirvan despues para ayudarte a conseguir un logro y con el ya mencionado modo cooperativo tienes un sinfin de diversion con amigos y siendo muy estrategico mediante ellopara terminar y dejarme de rodeos un juego que no te puedes perder y es necesaria su compra creeme no te arrepentiras"

Evolve,"plague inc Evolved is probably the first game that has made me actually fear for my safety its also the first game that allows me to destroy humanity with diseases like RIRE and weed which i had named myself for a small laughwhile the game is in early access it seems to be mostly done with only a few things missing such as multiplayer and the tutorial but that doesnt stop it from being a good game with what it hasthe game is in early access and is based off the popular smartphone app with the same name and well yes you could play that for 2 but you wouldnt have as many featuresachievements theres a ton of them or visuals since the game looks great on pc the app is however a good means as to see how the game works game explanation basicly you select a type of disease all of which work differently you then select a starting country to infect your first victim and as your virus spreadsinfectskills ect you gain points which you can then spend to gain upgrades which do a viraty of things from allowing it to infect certain animals to making it more resistant to heat or cold which can effect the outcome and reaction of the world greatly your first time playing will probably come as a quick defeat as you learn which upgrades are best at what time in your diseases development and i would love to go into detail about my strategy but this is a review not a guide dso is the game worth the 1499 price tag in its current state the answer is probably not unless youre a big fan of the smartphone game or a fan of these types of games the problem with the game in my opinion is that most of the diseases feel the same they do all have differences but most are so small you barely feel a difference between them which can cause the game to get boring fast the zombie and mindworm diseases which are new feel very well done providing a fresh new experence due to their completely different upgrades and playstyle from the rest of the diseases and if other diseases were to follow suit and get a redesign to make them all unique from each other i would be much more willing to recommend this game for its pricewhile i cant fully recommend the game for the price right now i can only hope the game will grow to be worth 1499 because it is a good game it just needs a little more grabbing power to keep people coming back for more and although im not quite sure how multiplayer will work it could just be the thing to do it thanks for reading"

Tf2,"guns 2 the second duel for the entirety that i had played feels like guns the duel but with more regulation as a shield trooper i didnt feel clunky at moments i actaully was able to get around faster than the other two female classes silent avengers are a remnant of the original guns the game played as armored core would if they mixed it with Tf2 and warframe the pve is well made in a arcadey beat em up fashion as you kill enemies they drop health and ammo till you progress to the next room level etc shield troopers even with the shield still fell short to the enemies massive count though even with 3 other partners so its not the easiest game to win the cash shop is pretty standard and all the guns have little to no difference in base dps oh and dont pick shield trooper because if you do youll have to pay ingame currency for the other characters a solid 81100"

Nuclear_Throne,"i recieved Nuclear_Throne in a humble monthly bundle and it is by far the game that has recieved the most playtime from the bundle Nuclear_Throne is a roguelite twin stick shooter with an interesting progression system within your runs your selected mutant will be able to accumulate different mutations after each stage if you have collected enough radiation drops from enemies there is a large variety of guns which i doubt ive done more than merely scratch the surface of the core gameplay loop is very enjoyable and i will continue to put hours into this gem i do however have a few gripes with the video choices within the game the framerate is capped at 30 i have heard that this is a problem with gamemaker studio not necassarily the devs though apparently when you create a project you have to explicitly choose a framerate for it to run at and later on requires a tonne of work to change perhaps the blame may lie with the devs on that one but frankly its not a big issue for me becuase of the existing graphical quality of the game and its not in first person also the game is played in a 43 window within a 169 interface i think this is an odd design choice but hey it hasnt affected the gameplay for me i would also love a story mode for this game it doesnt have to be 30 hour campign or anything but i think it would enhance the experience for me i will ot however hold this against the devsoverall 910i would highly recommend this game to any of my friends and the few video oddities are overseeable you are getting great value in this game"

Tf2,"Tf2 is one of the best free to play games on steam"
The_Community,"like many coop games this is great with friends and terrible with random people i will admit however after playing for a while random peoples is not as bad but playing with friends is still way more funon the positive side the game engine if very sound excellent graphics its fast paced and fun to play it has multiple difficulty levels ranging from seriously too easy to omg this is too hard so just about eveyrone can enjoy it none of the dlc is required to play the game and if your friend has more dlcs than you easily play with them its pretty slick how you can always play with your friends if everyone owns the base gameon the negative side the game can be a bootfest with random people i feel the developer could easiely do quite a bit to make it not so terrible and make it easier to meet like minded players if youre playing with freinds that being i have meet cool people and all but that takes a bit of persistance additionally while the game itself seems to be solid theres an ongoing issue with the developer where the developer stated at multiple times there would never be microtransactions and after pushing out wave after wave of not the best dlc they added a micro tranaction system some people have an issue with this some people feel they made amends and some just do not care additonally the devs seem to lie and manipulate The_Communitythis game gets regular updates some of the updates are great some of the updates not so much adding missions weapons characters things to the game is great the weapon rebalance the manner in which weapon skins were added adding improvements for people who bought an exclusive dlc thats no longer offered amoung other things were not so great i like the regular updates but i dont like having to drink regularly to be able handle the changesthis is a good game so good ive bought the base game for multiple other people to get them into it i however find it increasingly harder and harder to support the devs and regretable to get people into it also since payday 3 is annouced ill probably choose not get into that after the mess the devs made in this game"
Tf2,"awesome game completely free to play but you can get a ton of hats if you go premium Tf2 is a pretty balanced game toodefinitely recommend this game"
Tf2,"es un juego muy divertido lo puedes jugar muchas horas porque su modo de jugabilidad es muy adictivo entretenido y lo mas importante no se vuelve muy repetitivo ademas es un free2play lo que hace que su comunidad de juego sea inmensa lo unico malo es que al ser free2play hay muchas personas y eso genera que algunos servers tengan un gran lag pero eso finalmente no es culpa de Tf2 un juego muy recomendado para la gente que no quiere gastar dinero y tambien para la gente que si quiere gastar dinero porque puede tener articulos que los demas no tienen pero siempre con un equilibrio de ser justo con los dos tipos de jugadores muy recomendado"

Css,"if you want a fun game to do whatever you want in this is the game for you i reccomend that you buy Css with this game because otherwise many maps you play on or download will be missing textures the game is insanly fun to play with friends and i will continue to play it until i find another game like it the game runs very easily as it is running on the hl2 engine which is very old a must have for your steam library and i think that this game will continue to grow into the future and will be continue to be modded for a very long time"
Evolve,"risk of rain is a brilliant platformerrougelite the main thing with this game that pulls me into this game is how easily i can switch from being underpowered to overpowered and then back again in split seconds mostly from getting too cocky when i have certain powerups p its genuinely a hard game and i love it for that reason the music is a selling point as well sort of a rockyelectronicambient thingthe difficulty scales just right for me it gives me a good 25 minutes to do what i need to do in each level so i can do either a quick pickupandplay run or i could do a good 40 min run to rarely get to the last level plus this game actually makes me want to collect every single powerup and monster log just for the little storys you get alonethe only gripe i have with it is how complicated it is to connect with friends when i want to connect with a friend i have to use a program called Evolveevolvehqcom that gives me and my friends a temp ip address and even that fails some of the timeall in all this is a solid game that rates highly on my games list"
Garrys_Mod,"i would recommend this game to anyone as there are many different features and games that can by played on Garrys_Mod i would rate it a 910 because it can be a bit annoying it you dont have the right resource packs for prop hunt and other games"

Tf2,"ok so all my friends asked me to review this game but i dont want it be as long as the borderlands 2 review so lets use an ign structure the presentation of this game is amazing the characters art style and music are all amazing to be honest i think this is the 2nd best game valve have ever produced and that is because of the detail all the characters are balanced and holy fun to play as each character is completely different letting you play the game in 9 different ways now about the trading aspect just look at mine and my friend hugobosscat inventory and that should tell you about our opinion on the trading so in a whole Tf2 is one of the best games ever made and its free"
Tf2,"i think you guys must play this game because its awsome funit has 9 classes to choose from and theres thousands of maps inside Tf2you can play with bosses such as saxton haledemo linkbemo pan and more"
Team_Fortress_2,"Team_Fortress_2 is a fun action firstperson shooter with a cartoon like style it has a good variety of classes my favourite is the spy and has loads of cool items and weapons to unlock it has lots of great maps and fun game modes from man vs machine to capture to the flag this is a game i totally recommened unless your 6 6 year olds are too young to be playing violent games in conclusion if you dont have steam money and you want a fun cartoonic shooter to play than this is perfect for you"

class and most objectives achived in that life etcgame modesin capture the flag maps the objective for both teams is to obtain a briefcase of intelligence from the enemy teams base and return it to their own base while preventing the opposing team from doing the same the player carrying the intelligence can be killed to drop the briefcase or the player can willingly drop it in either case this starts a brief timer a team can only score by delivering the enemys intelligence to their base a match lasts until one team scores a set number of points or time runs out a variant of capture the flag called special delivery has teams vying over a single briefcase to attempt to deliver to a common target once the intelligence is picked up by one team only members of that team can carry it until either it successfully delivered or the drop timer expires and it is returned to its original spawn point control point modes are more varied in their objectives but share the common aim of capturing a particular point on the map by having one or more team members stay on the point without the presence of the opposing team for a short period of time in standard control point maps each team already controls an equal number of points with one additional point left unclaimed teams can only attempt to capture points that are nearest to those points they already control each team attempts to progressively capture all the control points to win the round in attackdefendstyle maps the red team already controls all the points on the map and must hold these points from being captured by the opposing team blu team for a length of time attackdefendstyle maps can come in either singleround or multipleround maps rounds past the first will only be played if blu wins a roundterritorial control

fixed amount of timeking of the hill features a single control point in the center of the map with teams vying for control over it the control point is locked for a set amount of time after the round start once the point is unlocked either team can capture it capturing the control point starts the teams clock counting down the clock that is currently counting down will only stop if the other team captures the point the clock reaches 00 or another mapspecific event occurs such as a halloween boss spawning during the halloween event teams win the round when their clock reaches 00 with the control point currently under their control if the other team is capturing the point the round will not end until the points capture progress resets to 0payload maps feature a length of track atop which sits a bomb mounted on a cart these maps come in two varieties in normal payload maps one team must escort the cart through a series of checkpoints in a limited amount of time to reach a final target that the other team defends the cart moves when one or more players of the team are near it without enemies nearby during this the cart heals and provides ammo to those close by if no one is by the cart it may move backwards towards the last checkpoint or roll off uphill sections of the track in payload races both teams race to deliver a bombcart to a final target there are no checkpoints and unmanned carts will not move in reverse but still require team members nearby to fully complete uphill sections both types of payload maps can come in singleround or multipleround maps in standard payload further rounds will only be played if blu wins in payload race all rounds will be played regardless of which team wins but the winner of previous rounds starts with their cart farther up the

classes contain pdas and other unique items Team_Fortress_2 was released with six offical maps but many more maps have been added a neat little addition to this game is the administrator a woman announces different game events over pa or loudspeaker so that everyone in the game can hear it stats are a extreamly nice addition to this game where time played as a certain class most kills as that class and most objectives achived in that life etcgame modesin capture the flag maps the objective for both teams is to obtain a briefcase of intelligence from the enemy teams base and return it to their own base while preventing the opposing team from doing the same the player carrying the intelligence can be killed to drop the briefcase or the player can willingly drop it in either case this starts a brief timer a team can only score by delivering the enemys intelligence to their base a match lasts until one team scores a set number of points or time runs out a variant of capture the flag called special delivery has teams vying over a single briefcase to attempt to deliver to a common target once the intelligence is picked up by one team only members of that team can carry it until either it successfully delivered or the drop timer expires and it is returned to its original spawn point control point modes are more varied in their objectives but share the common aim of capturing a particular point on the map by having one or more team members stay on the point without the presence of the opposing team for a short period of time in standard control point maps each team already controls an equal number of points with one additional point left unclaimed teams can only attempt to capture points that are nearest to those points they already control each team attempts to progressively capture all the control points to win the round in attackdefendstyle maps the red team already controls all the points on the map and must hold these points from being captured by the opposing team blu team for a length of time attackdefendstyle maps can come in either singleround or multipleround maps rounds past the first will only be played if blu wins a roundterritorial control is a more complex version of control point in which each map is divided into a number of closed sections held between the two teams each round has one team attempting to seize control of the opposing teams capture point for that section in a fixed amount of time once a team holds all but the enemys home base point they then attempt to capture the enemy base point while the enemy defends for a fixed amount of timeking of the hill features a single control point in the center of the map with teams vying for control over it the control point is locked for a set amount of time after the round start once the point is unlocked either team can capture it capturing the control point starts the teams clock counting down the clock that is currently counting down will only stop if the other team captures the point the clock reaches 00 or another mapspecific event occurs such as a halloween boss spawning during the halloween event teams win the round when their clock reaches 00 with the control point currently under their control if the other team is capturing the point the round will not end until the points capture progress resets to 0payload maps feature a length of track atop which sits a bomb mounted on a cart these maps come in two varieties in normal payload maps one team must escort the cart through a series of checkpoints in a limited amount of time to reach a final target that the other team defends the cart moves when one or more players of the team are near it without enemies nearby during this the cart heals and provides ammo to those close by if no one is by the cart it may move backwards towards the last checkpoint or roll off uphill sections of the track in payload races both teams race to deliver a bombcart to a final target there are no checkpoints and unmanned carts will not move in reverse but still require team members nearby to fully complete uphill sections both types of payload maps can come in singleround or multipleround maps in standard payload further rounds will only be played if blu wins in payload race all rounds will be played regardless of which team wins but the winner of previous rounds starts with their cart farther up the trackarena is a team deathmatch mode typically occurring smaller environments featuring a single control point in each round players do not respawn on death a team wins the round by capturing the control point or eliminating all of the other team membersmedieval mode can be played on maps dedicated to this mode or enabled for any other mode type this mode forces players to use melee or similar

Terraria,"if u like hardcore minecraft this is the game for you much more immersive then minecraft in minecraft there is no exploration purposes but in Terraria u can find special statues gems like diamonds rubys ect far more ores and minerals and its actually graduately harder then minecraft the game can either like you or hate u with a wide veriety of monsters and bosses more then minecraft that has only 2 the point here is that even if u like minecraft this game can make it worth your while"
Terraria,"unturned is a really fun game and sometimes even show really i mean really funny moments i recommend trying it unlike Terraria and left for dead 2 it is more like a sandbox game because you can get really creative and build things like Terraria but also go ahead have fun by killing some zombies to be honest unturned is still a early development game which makes is more intresting because we will never know what will happen in the future and what it will be like when fully complete the even better things about this game is that is 2 perspective first person and third person recently unturned just added vrvirtural reality which makes it more fun to get in the experience of what a zombie apoclypse fells like and how you can survive in iti strongly recommend this game but i do have a few tips maybe like add a main power place and add more weapons to make the game a bit more relastic such as a ak47 but the main things i suggest you need to figure out is a story line of how the zombie apoclypse started because the new players wont know how it happend and just get spawned right into the game"
Csgo,"Csgo the best fps on pc"

Tf2,"arent you glad team fortress 2 didnt wind up looking like this valve has created quite a game with the longawaited team fortress sequel bearing many similarities to its predecessor though incorporating enough changes to make it feel fresh the most obvious aspect which you may have noticed from any of the screens and video posted is the visual style even after getting sucked into probably too many hours of play in the beta over the past few weeks were still amazed at the art design both in how it looks and how it animates but lets not get too carried away with the graphics its a game after all and the most important factor is how it plays and if its entertaining its interesting to see both team fortress 2 which has been in development on and off for some seven years now and splash damages enemy territory quake wars which has seen its own share of setbacks and delays finally come out right around the same time their nearly simultaneous retail release presents and interesting situation for you the consumer as to how to spend your cash you may fondly remember your days in return to castle wolfenstein enemy territory dropping air strikes on hapless attackers and eagerly charging into bunkers to spout forth deadly plumes of flamethrower fuel yet you cant forget your days with team fortress classic or even further back with the original team fortress quake mod with its now painfully dated character models but compelling teamfocused online play theres really no right answer in this case as to which game is ultimately better its merely personal preference quake wars is assuredly the more complicated game for those uninitiated in the ways of enemy territory the scope dynamic objectives speed at which the tide of battle can turn and the number of things you need to quickly consider when that happens and user interface can be rather daunting after learning the ins and outs its clearly an excellent product but it lacks that immediate irresistible appeal so prominent in valves team fortress 2 and accessibility may very well be the deciding factor in determining which product users prefer regardless its an excellent time to be a gamer since as tough as it may be to pick one or the other making either choice rewards you with a well designed and highly entertaining title like in team fortress classic tfc team fortress 2 has nine character classes spy pyro soldier heavy medic sniper demoman scout and engineer each class abilities on the battlefield have been streamlined which along with the graphics is what makes team fortress 2 so much more accessible than tfc no longer do you have engineers running around with railguns and emp grenades medics cant infect the other team spies dont have tranquilizer darts and none of the classes have hand grenades in Tf2 each class has roughly three main ways of attacking a primary weapon the heavys minigun pyros flamethrower engineers sentry gun etc and secondary various classes have shotguns others pistols while the demoman has a highly effective mine thrower and melee weapons the scouts bat the medics bonesaw and so on though classes now possess fewer means of attacking the resulting gameplay feels much more focused each class has a very clearly defined role and the means to ensure they perform successfully the only limiting factor is of course how effectively your team meshes together if your engineers arent guarding their structures spies can wipe them out in seconds with a few sapper charges if your team is full of heavies and soldiers but lacks medics youre not going to get very far if youre playing a capture point map without any scouts on your team you might as well just leave the server or start berating your squadmates until a few switch classes the medic though seems to be the hinge on which all gameplay balance swivels for Tf2 theyve been given a health hose which blasts out a restorative stream at friendlies within range and sticks to them as long as you keep the fire button depressed as you heal injured teammates or overheal to 150 percent health an ubercharge meter builds in the bottom right of the screen unleashing this renders both target and medic invulnerable for a few seconds which is sometimes the only way to break through chokepoints populated with heavies medics and multiple tier three sentry guns even though medics may be the most vital to a teams success the other classes remain useful scouts who are now rather deadly are far and away the fastest and their ability to doublejump and change direction in midair makes then all the more difficult to hit spies in addition to being able to onehit kill backstab the enemy cause general chaos among enemy ranks if your opponents know a spy is running around theyll waste time and lose focus by shooting at their own teammates to try and reveal a disguised culprit pyros tend to be the most effective spy detectors and can be frequently seen doing fiery pirouettes in 2fort matches all over the beta servers as a spy incognito will betray his cover by bursting into flames upon contact with the burning sprayin a september 26 steam update friendly fire was removed from Tf2 which was definitely a good move friendly fire ruins much of the game considering the closequarters maps combined with the wide area of effect attacks of heavies pyros demomen and soldiers without ff teammates are free to shoot each other since if they bleed health theyre a spy"

Terraria,"an old man awaits at the entrance of a dungeon stricken by a mysterious curse he urges you to return after the sun has set to free him of the madness that has infected his body so you spend the day amid the grassy splendor of Terraria surveying caves slaying rabbits and slimes as the hours tick by once night has set you return to the old man to free him of his curse and reap whatever rewards he wishes to give you it turns out that the little curse transformed the old man into a demonic skeleton a hovering monstrosity that unleashes holy hell upon your poorly equipped explorer the

keyboard keys so theres joy in traversing the world that didnt exist before however movement isnt nearly as important as excavation and thats where patience matters no longer can you dig precisely with a mouse instead you use a stick the game has two options manual and smart which have different strengths and weaknesses if youre clearing a deep hole smart is blunt and effective if you need to focus on individual blocks manual works fine unfortunately your cursor is controlled by both the right stick and the back touchpad and theres no way to disable the second scheme so you do have to hold

Csgo,"death is a great teacher failure in counterstrike global offensive is as it always has been for this series the greatest way to learn where you should have gone what you shouldnt have done and how you could have done better counterstrike players spend a lot of time learning consequently they are always getting bettergrowth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if you ' re a call of duty player you ' re going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what it ' s always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 yearsfor the uninitiated counterstrike global offensive is a smallscale teambased firstperson shooter with permanent death when a counterterrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic defusal match or a ct escort swallows a sniper round in hostage rescue the victim is dead for good and doesnt respawn until the next round as such players on both sides must exercise skill and care the bomb objective meanwhile gives everyone a purpose of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the cts the slip plant their bomb and protect the bomb site between rounds everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns and the cycle continuespieces of the counterstrike formula are dated at this point but the superb heart and soul of global offensive is timeless teams are small guns are lethal and rounds are short theres an addictive justonemoreround quality to it because theres a constant desire to do better than last time to earn a satisfying kill or to win in a new way call of duty and battlefield vets will wonder why they cant sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim counterstrike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard but the changes are for the best the underpass choke point in dedust for instance has a new escape routeeven in the face of genre evolution global offensive doesn ' t care to adapt Csgo is so dedicated to counterstrikes aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it bruteforces its way to success part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in global offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters everyone is limited to what they have and can see with little room for character modification or onthefly advantages running and gunning is a useless play style even if youve bought a helmet and kevlar that round to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill walking crouching or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machinegun fireconsequently killing in global offensive feels good theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back its also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim if players arent watching corners providing covering fire or using smoke grenades and flashbangs theyre more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman the desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing even when youre getting steamrolled by an obviously better teamif youve played counterstrike before global offensive probably sounds a whole lot like counterstrike like counterstrike source before it global offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter while doing little to disrupt the core form and function at the same time it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effortfire is one of the most interesting new combat variables molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic too theyre particularly useful during demolition matches which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between the new and modified maps in this mode arent as big as classic counterstrike arenas - entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location - but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever the lake map is a standout theres a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots to separate demolition from defusal players cant buy between rounds instead it takes a cue from the other new mode arms race in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly the better you do the more you have to switch up the way you play and because demolition is so fast youll need to be quick on your feet"
