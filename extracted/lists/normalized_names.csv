Tf2,"this game has an excellent style of fighting with high amounts of diferent weapons to use from with the help of the hl2 engine the graphics models of weapons and characters this deserves one of the best shooters game of all time as well as this mapmaking is avaliable to all people who are willing to do it same with plugins for custom servers source film maker and many more things this is overall a stunning game that i have played for a while and deserves a yes gg valvesome things that may put it down however would be the fact that some recent updates are very similar in terms of style for example the gun mettle update brought in contracts new maps etc the halloween update brought in the same thing but just different missionspeople who play other shooter games that are like cod battlefield etc one thing i would have to say to those people would be dont shout at the medic to run to you and specifically you because apparantely you are the one carrying the team with your gibus and goggles and your natascha family business and your eviction notice pub doesnt work like that sunshineas well as this dont be an heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit to the new kid or some heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit just because you got screwed over when you were new at some point this new kid will have a better inventory yes i know just because having an expensive inventory doesnt make you a better player better items and a better fighting style Tf2 doesnt need those kinds of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit on their serverseither way although there are some parts of the years to come that will be lazy there will be better things introduced frankly i want some new weapons theyve been just introducing reskins example batsaberyes"
Tf2,"well for starters when i write reviews they are usually just for the RIRE this is not the case this game is genuinely a masterpiece and i have never played a game that made me feel so many emotions that range all over the spectrum i mean hell i thought the last of us was emotional as hell one minute its happy then desparation then wanting to cry like a baby points in the game specifically made me question my manhood due to how much i was trying to not break down like a baby this game honestly does show alot of great points that are true in real life as well like value those close to you and despite this being the internet and it not being known to be shown but showing compassion and taking the time to give a helping hand could possibly save someones life it is funny that a troll on Tf2 would find such a great love and change of perspective from a game call me names call me what ever the hell you like i never thought i would go deep about a game but simply put this game while it may not be for everyone is a really great game and i honestly say it is worth more that just 20 dollars 10010"

The_Community,"great game you can tell just by the number of people reviewing this game negatively with over 100h or 400h playedsure there are a few bugs but the devs are working hard on fixing stuff communicate with The_Community and release patches with a lot of new content every other monththis is a game based on grinding and sometime it will take time to get your gears just the way you want it but the dz is a great experience with some balancing issues that will shift the meta of the game strongly towards a build here and therehavent seen a hacker in 2 months playing the dz fairly often rank 82 people saying the game is full of hackers are the same guys that get rekt in cs and call hacks on everyone i strongly recommend this game for both the pve and the pvp aspect"
Team_Fortress_2,"this is an awesome game may overtake Team_Fortress_2 this game is an awesome shooter you play as different classes and like blacklight retribution you need to spend time farming coins to unlock characters for ever or you can wait for monthly trial rotations of the characters is great to play with friends and solo"
Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"this is a great game an fps tactical game that is more aim and team work than cod run around and spray and pray hoping to god that the server lag is in your favor overall Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive is a great map with a good community base exammple the over watch although the people you play with may be toxic or the bestfunniest people to play with warning if you play this game and you seek short periods of fun then casual and deathmatch are the way to go that and arms race dont play competitive match making if you dont have atleast 45 minutes to 1 hours worth of time for one game thats right you need a lot of time to play competitive match making let alone get good at the game that way otherwise i would recommend this game as it is enjoyable and not too over the top"

Terraria,"combines aspects from other games in a way that makes the game truly unique in its own way one of the only if any mmos that allows you to dig on the Terrarian itself although you cant build on the terrain unless its in your own cornerstone which is basically your own portable headquarters that you craft things at for an mmo this game took an interesting style of graphics that i havent seen done before in an mmo a bunch of classes to chose from all seeming quite different from one another the game is free can be a good mmo for someone whos never played one you can deassemble a weapon or accessory you dont want to turn it into crafting materials that you may find more usefulstating this many reviews on here say that the problem with the game is that it takes so long to connect to servers but this has been fixed to my understanding although there is a huge arsenal of weapons that you are preassigned based on your class eg shadow archers will only receive bows none of them actually change the way you fight or for that matter give you any feeling of variety you progress so quickly that an item you picked up that you may have considered to be really good at the time can quickly become outdated in terms of stats the game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you dont actually feel accomplished no storyline none this game is repetitive most of your objectives in this game are basically kill this and receive this or mine this and receive this due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking why am i even doing this no actual quests you have a predetermined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing you have no freedom to do what you want that is if you want to actually make progress within the game you must complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one the entire game is randomly generated making there feel like theres nothing to actually explore its just randomly generated terrain and dungeons that also seem to be very repetitive you must make an account for the game itself this isnt so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work both me and my friend had the problem character customization itself is bad not the hats theres plenty of those there arent many color options as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color eg you can not change your height width etc things in the tutorial seem to be out of order for example around my first hour of gameplay i was being being told the buttons used to attack even though i had already killed loads of enemies does not have very much music all drops are marked as uncommonrare when it comes to the rarity tag of an item ive never seen a single item marked as common i feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplishedthis game hashad a lot of potential it really did sadly i have to say that i must give this game a 410 for the reasons listed above"
The_Community,"alright so this game is amazing alot of people say it copied ark but youre wrong anyways to a review the game is awesome so many things to do great with friends everything you really need there is a downside though that really hurts The_Community in australiano aus servers they may be coming soon but at the moment i go on it regularly just to see if its had an update for aus servers i would still recommend picking it up if its on sale atleast 25 and play with friends on a local hosted serveri give it a thumbs up but if youre in australia dont bother unless you are a singeplayer person stand high ping or if its atleast 50 offhope this helped"

Loadout,"lets start off with something this game is amazingwhen you first start off in the game your going to be put in a battlefeildcounter strike enviroment choosing between two teams insurgency or security you will be faced with a detailed Loadout selection and class selection each class on each team has access to different guns attachments etc and you have a set amount of equipment tokenspoints to spend on your Loadout you also have a weight meter which can determine whether your Loadout will make you run fast or slow and how fast your stamina will run outnow lets get into the combatthe combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead from the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic it is if you move up on your own your playing a wild card instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you completecapture an objective yes there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from most of which include control areas there is virtually no hud heads up display the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have and info about the objectives the gunplay is realistic recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing 12 bullets from most guns can take down an enemylets talk graphicsthe graphics in the game are not spectactular but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay though the design and textures on the weapons look great you cant really expect a game run and made on the source engine and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing battlefield graphicsoverall gameplaythe gameplay is realistic tense and rewarding if you play the game right what a mordern military shooter should be it offers great and realistic gunplay a variety of gamemodes and maps insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more also teamwork is a thing in this game"
Loadout,"finished it again and again pretty fun to come back and play through it again while forcing myself to use different Loadouts great fusion of action points based planning with cooldown timer and real time actionyou get to activate a mode that freezes everything and allows you to plan moves might not execute the way you want it exactly also a penalty of disabling all function use after activating said feature unless you have a modifier attached to a function if you wonder what functions are just think them as weapons you can use and those weapons can also be used as a weapons modifier tons of combinations to pummel everything in your way lul"

Nuclear_Throne,"enter the gungeon is a roguelike top down shooter similar to games like the binding of isaac or Nuclear_Throne each levelfloor is randomly generated with all sorts of special rooms combat rooms secret areas and of course the boss you will need to defeat to progress to the next floor the game is perma death meaning when you die your run is over for good adding a bunch of challenge to the game gungeon has a dodge roll mechanic that is used to avoid bullets and consumable blanks that destroy all bullets on the screen these make the game a bit easierthere are many many different guns buffs and active and passive abilites allowing for heaps of potential synergies the game is also chock full of cheesy gun related puns and references to other gamestv shows etcoverall this enter the gungeon is really fun but it can be hard and frustrating at times"

Garrys_Mod,"i quite like rust but its definetly not perfect rust is basically dayz minecraft and Garrys_Mod combined into one game for the most part its pretty good but rust is a bit rusty at its early stages see what i did there because as most of you know rust is still in early access which means developers are still working on the game and theres quite a lot of bugs seriously there is and its the simple things like not getting into a server and not being able to craft items and other bugs and glitches that are really annoying as it stands now its a solid game but i wan na see what happens for rust in the future 20 bucks i think is a bit steep for what it is at the moment but if you wan na give this game i try i say go ahead it gets an 810 rock holding cave men"

Evolve,"surprisingly its a really rather good citybuilderdisclaimer long and detailed review skip to bottom for final verdicti got tropico 4 in a humble bundle kindve only wanting the other games in the bundle so there it sat in my vast steam library not really doing anything and then my friend told me about a really good citybuilder that he had been playing i thought oh simcity right wrong he was talking about tropico tropico 5 however at this time i had forgotten that i even had it so when i looked it up on the steam store i realised that i already had it so i gave it a shot and i was quite presently surprised so here is a list explaining the good and bad elements of tropico 4 and there reasonsproseach little person has their own profilewhat was one of the elements that made tropico stand out was the ability to click on every little person walking around doing there daily routine once you clicked on them a profile of the character came up explaining their age wellbeing faction name where they work and where they live it would also make the camera follow that person sometimes i would find myself just seeing people go about their daily lives for hours on endin the population there are structured familiesa little more of a unnecessary part of the game but undoubtedly cool was the structured families sometimes when checking peoples profiles you may find a group of people with the same last name at first i thought ths was just due to the developers not putting enough names in but then i executed a guy and then everybody with the same last name as him got enraged confused i looked at the effects of executing someone and it said victims family will become enraged and thats when i realised there was families which is really coola system where technology Evolves with timemuch like civilization v which is an utterly fantastic strategy game technology would advance as time goes on this means that i might start out with some crappy tenements but when i research more stuff i could have super hightec shopping malls nuff saidthe ability of extreme powerin this game you have the power of anything and everything on the island apart from the rebels which we will get to later none of the decisions will be made for you you have to make them there are recomendations for what to build but i mostly found myself ignoring them as sometimes they can screw you overrebelsthe rebels system in this game is rather good its simple when someone becomes too unhappy with the island they will become a rebel rebels can and will screw you over they will start fires attack buildings and people and generally become out of controldisastersperhaps copying other citybuilders this game has disasters dont worry though you wont be having meteors or aliens ordinosaurs coughsimcitycough just normal things like nuclear bombs or volcano eruptions or earthquakes and it wont just be mildly annoying either it will seriously screw you over once when i built my city next to a volcano thinking it would look pretty cool lets just say it wasnt cool when flying blobs of lava engulfed the city and i went financialy in debtso thats the list of things which i think are pretty cool in this game now we will talk about the consconslimited timethe thing i can think of straight off the bat is that it has a limited amount of time for a game even in sandbox mode sure it is a while but one time i built a really great cityand then i couldnt play anymore because my mandate had run out and that was on maximum time sure it adds realism but sometimes fun should overweigh how realistic it is this is where just cause 2 shined now you might be thinking what the devil what on earth has that got ot do with tropico well my friend nothing i was just bringing it up anyways the reason just cause 2 was so fun is that it was completely unrealistic tropico should get some inspiration off thatlack of helpone of the annoying things about this game is that it just throws you in with build a city this is a large downside as the game is quite complicated in the financial part of things alot of the time i found myself looking at my amount of money going down by the thousands completely confused whygraphicsnow i would like to point out that this is a very small and minor problem especially considering its a citybuilder but the graphics are a little lackingfinal verdictso we are down to the final verdict and if you couldnt already tell with the big blue thumbs up stamped on i most certainly recomend tropico 4 even though it has flaws i can still say this is a great solid citybuilder thank you for taking some time to read this"

Tf2,"this game for me was a real gem admittedly i am not a big fan of puzzle games that involves a stealth mechanic but with the unique mechanic that is the crosslink system the game becomes a lot less of just waiting and moving and waiting and moving but instead becomes more like setting up a complex mouse trap that incapacitates every guard in the building with the flick of a switch and thats where the fun comes from not the hiding and the stakes of being found but trying to find the quickest and easiest way to the objective through utilisation of the environment the story is clever well written but short the level design is topnotch and with the implementation of a steam workshop supported level editor i can see a much longer playtime through the various community levelsoh and you get a Tf2 hatso even if you dont like stealth games theres a demo that you can test the water with and you never know it might just be that one good game you never see coming"

Dont_Starve,"an excellent city builder no tech tree no fancy jigamawots to help youwhat this game has and what you can do in this game the game has seasons eg winter spring summer make a town your town will have houses crop fields woodcutter blacksmiths and many more structures have to take care of your slavillagers villagers will start of as labourers you can give villagers individual jobs children eat your food and they do fck all they soon grow up to adults adults will eventually die from old age the game has a good tutorial you have to survive the winter if you dont have enough fire wood your villagers will freeze and diethis game is very detailed i have survived 8 years so far im still going wooh ingame years duhsome tips i find helpfull roads make your villagers walk faster crops are very good for food but it needs to grow if some of your structures are to far away from eachother put your stockpiles in between so your villagers dont have to walk as far to get to the stockpiles educated villagers are more efficient at their jobs make sure you stock up on firewood for the winter place the forester near many treeshope these tips helpif you get this game the only thing i can say is good luck and Dont_Starve and freeze to death"

Tf2,"not really much fun its Tf2 once you get to a certain point and its not even balanced the freetoplay users can not trade while the premium users can and thus youre crippled if you arent paying themup until level 20 a few hours youre stuck in a grind against ais then you can opt to do some small number of missions with random players against ai once more but its largely about the pvp play at that pointsadly the pvp isnt much fun because the leveled and paying players are better equiped by a fairly good marginskip it"
Tf2,"2200 hours of pure heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kickin fun this is a must have for all people who have a steam account people say Tf2 is a cod copy and when they do i check tab to see how many times this ahole had been dominated if youre just starting off i highly reccomend soldier he is a great starting off character he has decent health and damage and racist remarks thatll keep you laughing for days if you want to be the favourite on your team switch to medic and heal some folks or equip blutsauger medigun and bonesaw and just go full on battle medic a great gamode to start off in is control point it shows you how to get around efficently with great big maps but whatever you do avoid being seen wearing the gibus at all times unless painted this has to be the very best f2p game there is 1010"

The_Community,"i had a long hard think about it and yes it is a lot of money for what is essentially a few new guns it was a lot of money for 2 new helicopters but what i failed to understand then was that bohemia do things differently theyre not your activision or ea that spam out the same unoriginal dlc time and time again just as a simple cash grab bohemia listen to their community granted youre being constructive with your critisizm and they arent scabbing money off you for cheap remember karts all funds raised from that went to charityhelicopters and marksmen are priced as they are because you support the developers and development of the game weve been given a bulk of the dlc for free infact weve been given everything for free in the recent downloadable content all bar the ability to pilot the two new helicopters and a new showcase for slingloading im not a professional when it comes to game development but i understand the constraints a small team like bohemia have and i pledge my support to them because theyve made a series that not even your most popular shooters today come close to rivlingsomething that will come in the future is bigger dlc much like baf pmc and acr were to arma 2 there just needs to be a better understanding within The_Community of bohemias goals and aims with this game ive seen many people hang so much heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit on this game yet theyre not able to see the greater picture"
Men_Of_War,"for people who love the Men_Of_War series you should definately give call to arms a tryalthough its early access and there is no vehicles in multiplayer yet i definately recommend this game if you ever wanted a modern age in Men_Of_Warthough i would like to request that the helicopters should be able to hover like in Men_Of_War vietnam and maybe you should add an animation where troops zipline from the helicopter instead of landing in the middle of a battlefield and pretty much get shot down instantly apart from my request i guess the game is 910 just add more vehicles and maybe more factions but i dont know about that thoughit would be cool if there were morefactionsmaps vehicles new animationsmore units and maybe battleships maybe"
Csgo,"i give the game 910it is a good game im not sure about the skins though it makes it look like Csgo like game now since they added safes to crack its pretty much the Csgo unboxing boxes getting stuff the micro trancastions skins and the safes are kind of a bad idea i dont like itbut overall i think it is a great game"

Evolve,"set in the year 2050 the usa has fallen as a world superpower and no longer makes their own guns resorting instead to importing chinese made airsoft guns for use in their military they are also unable to provide enough ammunition for their troops with usps and m4a1s ammunition the hardest to come by although these chinese made airsoft guns are incredibly unreliable weak inaccurate and just sketchy in general they are relatively cheap with a desert eagle coming in at a budget 700 although the 50cal ammo is also made in china where they fill it with rubber bands and sparklers instead of steel and gunpowder resulting in a slightly less damaging round than its modern real life counterpart the artic warfare police sniper rifle has been greatly improved when compared to its modern variant and antigravity bullet curving technology invented in the year 2049 has been added to it making noscope shots and jump shots incredibly accurate and very useful this technology is also found in the scout which actually uses alien technology to create a paradox in which it is far more accurate at the peak of ones 15m tall jump while not scoped in than when standing completely still and scopedin the smgs are the result of many years of research and development with the worlds top minds having finally been able to create a weapon more powerful and versatile than the atomic bomb and with accuracy comparable to that of an olympic high diver even whilst moving at mach1 the ak47 once kalashnikovs most impressive creation is now nothing more than a canvas for major league gamings graphics design team with the average rifle sporting more colours than a gay pride flag however perhaps the greatest creation of the period 2050 is the newest r8 rEvolver its origins are completely unknown although some have conspired its original creator to have been a braindead vegetable who created the gun as a means of destroying incoming asteroids that may pose a threat to the safety of planet earth that aside apple microsoft and google no longer rule the global market as the largest companies in the world no that position has been overtaken by a company that manufactures seasonal weapon skins of varying rarities with the imf quickly considering ditching all forms of currency in exchange for p250 sand dunes and dragon lores the two opposing forces of the game the terrorists and counterterrorists have also come in to possession of technology that creates mini blackholes around them so even if you manage to land an accurate headshot using your chinese airsoft gun it will still inflict no damage to your target and your bullet will completely disappear from the face of the earth long lost in an interdimensional tear in space time along with your rank and dignity which are nowhere to be seen this really is a grim game and it shakes me to my core to imagine a future such as the one depicted in this game where the worlds largest battles are won by mere chance and luck rather than skill or military prowess 910 avoid buying this at all costs"
Portal,"this was a really edgy mod it adds to the lore of Portal and gives its own spicy story though i did noclip like half of the game because was extremely hard in my opinion i wouldnt call that a complaint though as it was made to be hard besides that i still enjoyed the majority of the game the voice acting in this is impressive tooif you enjoyed Portal 2 then you should definitely get this as it is free"

Team_Fortress_2,"while i dont play it anymore Team_Fortress_2 is an amazing game its fun and has a surprising amount of backstory with the comics and meet the videos every class feels different and is well balanced cant say the same for some items though and the modding community makes the game even greater by adding new content such as skins new gamemodes and new models Team_Fortress_2 is a game that everyone should try out and play with friends45"
Terraria,"Terraria in space"
Terraria,"Terraria is a fun exploration based sandbox game that appeals to people of all ages more so into the adolescent years it has great mechanics and the classic arcadey feel of 2d sidescrollers will hook you in a wonderful rpg its bosses and other sprites have a wonderful and monstrous art style that add to the feel its relatively new 13 update had a graphic overhaul and while relogic have stated that no more major updates will happen you can still enjoy Terraria in its beautyi would certainly recommend this game to any fans of the genre and even if you arent too familiar with it i believe youll love it4755"

Dont_Starve,"this game is addictive i highly recommended Dont_Starve for anyone who likes challenging and hardcore style its really fun and the development has announced that they will add multiplayer in this game which is cool buy it now otherwises it gon na increase prices"
Metro_2033,"metro last light has the revamped but faithful aesthetic that all sequels do and a hint of the brooding quality of 2033 but sadly last light has the texture of nothing more than an expansion for the original masterwork last lights main attraction the campaign holds an uneven tale that varies from cliched to thrilling but it chiefly favours the middle ground of these two the first half to 3 quarters of the story lacks the startling originality and intense desolate air 2033 portrayed to remarkable effects but with the gritty and grimy ambiance used as a crutch last light stays above water and carries the player through with few articulate qualms save the dated ai and unabashed exposition present in almost every encounter it is when we reach the final act in last light that things begin to crack and crumble a rushed conclusion pooled with little climax creates a palpable sense of disheartenment as if our long winding journey towards this heavily anticipated finale was a waste of time alas this disappointment is what i ultimately walked away from last light with a spasmodically engrossing but stilted phase in the metro series gunplay and environments are barely worth mentioning as they follow the same archetypal structure of their predecessor but with slightly improved graphics caked over the top the main resonating feature in last light is sadly displeasure but then again it would be a miracle for this game to even come close to the staggering uniqueness and darkness that Metro_2033 was best known for6510im only recommending this because a thumbs down is a bit too harsh"

The_Community,"this game is a great game let me rephrase that this game was a great game wonder why ill tell you whyfirst off being honest i used to absoluteley love playing this game even before it was on steam the matches were fun balanced friendly and all out great even though the robot building was a bit tough i liked it as it gave me challenge to buid something cool but allow me to learn from what works and what doesnt but then it was introduced to steamfirst up what i though when i saw it first arrive on steam i was like oh awesome its on steam now now i can play with my friends it was good for quite a while but then they started updating alot more at first it was pretty good with the addition of armoured blocks and electroplates amongst other things but then the later updates happened they are what annoyed mefrom what i saw with those later updates were new blocks and some new game mechanics and matchmaking some were alright but others were absoluteley horrible ideas to even get to the development without asking The_Community what they wanted as if its freejams way of saying we dont give a damn about what The_Community wants added we just want more money and this kind of behavior really annoyed me as for one thing they changed they removed the armoured blocks for what heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing colours that you need premium for more than 4 types or was it the fact they wanted to attempt to balance the entire battle challenge of the game they also removed the pilot seat like thats what defined the shape of your robot and how you designed it as they likely wouldve though it being to easy to be killed they removed itnot only did they add new mechanics that heavily unbalanced the battles by having a 10sec nohit repair time delay that allows anyone to fully repair their bot if they stay untouched for 10 seconds but they changed the entire techtree so many heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing times it cant even be called a tech tree anymore its more of a damn techspiral now while it used to be you had to earn points to select what you wanted to unlock instead of leveling up to get each item consecutively like theyve done now and the fact that theyve set it with each conescutive item tier the price is drastically increased so most people will get premium to spend real money for ir i understand that they need money to keep it being developed but honestly 500 ingame credit price increase for one tier higher in which most people cant be bothered mustering enough ingame credits to buy alot of those as thats what most people doworst part is with the addition of the robot factory which is just a market where people can sell people thier robots so new players that get what they want will just purchase a high tier bot and use that which makes the games already unbalanced rank matching even worseto end this review rant if i made a review of this game before it was on steam and i would say that you should get and you should play it but im not instead im saying that you should not play it if you are unable to spend real money for this game as it basically a money making machine for the company and heres a message for the devs and freejam chnage what you have done to this game listen to The_Community dont just look at a few people saying that they dont like something or they would rather something listen to the people that actually care that actually want this game to be fun and something that they can play and actually enjoy playing itinstead of being annoyed by the tryhards with bought robots"
The_Community,"this is a good game and heres whyfirst off this game is not just a game with a few levels it has many and with the involvment of The_Community the amount of levels is almost limitless so you have many levels to challenge yourslef with and you can make your own levels so others may challenge themselves on your levelsnext is the fact that it uses music to create amazing game immersion with the levels being created so well that they are in time with the song used for that level so if you create your own level make it to a song so it fits perfectlynot too much to say about this game as it has such a small amout of amazing features but there is the fact that there are enough challenging acievements to keep you playing it for weeks on end unless you dont even care about achievements the levels should keep you going anywaythere is one thing that i would like to ask of the developers can you please add more sources for songs so people can use songs that cant be on newgrounds so that way people arent limited by the newgrounds audio pages"

The_Community,"miscreated is a multiplayer open world survival game in which you fight against the elements environment and living beings after a devastating war you will start in the world with a tshirt jeans and a flash light in which your goal will be to gear up by scavenging nearby houses car parks schools and other potential looting grounds for cars weaponry crafting components and tools combined with trying to avoid or possibly kill the existing mutants or survivorssomething to note considering every other survival game has this issue is The_Community isnt entirely a kill on sight type of mentality which is good youll get people chatting with you trading or even possibly grouping up to defend against bandits or you may even decide to build your own base and hoard all the loot in the universethe developers also seem very passionate about their game and are listening to feedback and followed by that is great ideas for future updates which will definitely make this game even better personally i would like to see more mutants so id be swarmed with no hope of surviving possibly increasing the limitations on how many objects you can have in your base followed by storage containers so you can hold all your items instead of throwing some away also i would like to see the temperature system back because ive heard people talk about it and it sounds very interestingi highly recommend this game for i have enjoyed my time so far i shall continue playing this whilst also keeping an eye out for the magnificent updates which take place join us now we need more people to jump on and get involved in the carnage"
The_Community,"an outstanding game thats so polished in its current state that it almost seems complete id pay the price of a triple a game even if theres only infantry warfare currently even with that in mind theres so many variations of outcomes fortification opportunity and tactical plays that will never make any scenario seem the same whats even better is almost if not all the player base follow orders word to word which makes the game vastly superior to any military game out there in the current mix on top of that The_Community is mature and friendly and is always willing to helpsummary this is truely the best community ive had the pleasure of playing with and will continue playing with to the ends of time 1010"

Nether,"im really sorry to say because this game looked awsome so much that i purchased it but i feel it is missing the mark they say you can access most of the sky scrapers but thats barely true and even the ones you can have a sad mdkgta3 feel 2 them i really dont know why it recomends a quad core 24gz cpu because the graphics resemble something from the early 200s and either their rendering system is doing the crysis thing of rendering things that you cant even see or something else is amiss but the few servers i did try were dull and uneventfull im not doing the narrow view thing and comparing to dayz because frankly i think state of decay is a better zombie survival game but i just found Nether underwelming dont get me wrong i liked some of the texture details and the mechanism as far as encorouging coopperative play rather than just killing every1 2 steal their things thats something that sux about most pvppve games rust as an example great game and well thought out but most people will kill you rather than work with you to survive but i liked the idea in this that you have clear reasons why you should work together and the safe zones are cool alot to do in there i guess what im trying to say is im underwhelmed at the moment and will have to just check back at a later point when things have been updated a bit more look forward to future updates"
Starbound,"right at the moment of writing this review i have bf4 gta5 and crysis3 waiting for me to play yet i am playing this game i know this is unfinished but the potential of what this game could become is epic imagine dayz minus the extreme clunkiness and a shooter capability and ease of use like cod or cs voice chat base building and bandits includedif you are not against early access or even if you are this is one of three games worth spending money on the others being dayz and Starboundupdate recent patch has ruined gameplay as the night cycle has gotten longer due to a new lighting engine but this does not effect players with the gamma cheat on their physical monitors battles overnight has completely turned pro gamma cheaters getting killed at night is now a much higher possibility"
Csgo,"im a veteran cs gamer since classic cs 14 i hated many gameplay decisions since 16 including the dreaded steam requirement2003 tactical shield16 not being able to remove the silencer instantly with weapon swapping and recently the one i regard the worst decision ever the removal of the mp5 and spray tagcs go players are now left with tbagging corpsesthe current players are riddled with hackers here and there and mostly play on the competitive matches these players have hacks which include wall hacks aimbots noflashsmoke etchackers never get vote kicked because they are mostly carrying their team while typical nonhacking kids get instant vote kicks as soon as they push their mic buttoncounterstrike is around 15 years old as of this review and valve have not locked down the hacking problem compared to many many other shooters there are only 2 hackless places that exist tournaments and internet cafes that actively sue walkin hackerson the other hand cs gameplay have not changed and remain smooth and swift spotting have grown more difficult as player textures blend better within terrain textures since cs source the inclusion of party search let you find games with friends but the classic auto balance fail on normal matches as parties of 3 or more get split over the two teams the workshop is a great addition for instant map download and gaming but steam accessibility and quality have always been sub par its like comparing facebook and google plus one is obviously designed by penguins but everyone is on it while the other has class and quality but nobody uses it all in all Csgo is worth the nostalgic visit but if you plan to stay buy it on a new steam account on a computer that you will never use your main account on download those hacks and join the competitive matches i would not recommend this game due to one single persistent con the enormous amount of direct effect hacking activityoh and if valve say that they have banned many hackers its because they have but also because they want you to feel that its now safe to play"

Evolve,"lets get all of this clear i played over twenty hours in the beta and it refused me to play any more apparently my beta time ran out however throughout every hour of this game i was finding new ways to play new tricks to try and new methods to win the round i had only played two different classes trapper and monster only two i cant imagine what else i could have learnt about the game if only i had played more i played twenty hours and was still stuck on how daisy worked when i first saw gameplay and trailers i was insistent on how unreplayable it seemed i stuck around though i entered for the beta and as i mentioned earlier i was hooked wow that looked pretty epic and i wonder if they would fall for was coming out of my mouth at least once each round they say in the evacuation tutorial tutorial for the evacuation gamemode that there are and i quote over 800 possible combinations for the ultimate in replayability thats the socalled campaign of Evolve there are something like five gamemodes at the moment if you werent blind enough to read the text if you chose the evacuation gamemode then you would know this not to mention the amount of tutorials they had already released in the tutorials section which displayed information about all the gamemodes that were going to be available on release so for all you whiners out there about how boring it is and how you got bored after two hours and how that must have had an oh so terrible impact on your life keep reading it gets even betteri also read in a lot of the thumbs down reviews that the game is multiplayer only for your information i have just tested the singleplayer completely offline disconnected from the wifi offline and i almost got my teeth kicked in by a bunch of normal difficulty bots i tried both teams you can play not only evacuation mode but also any other gamemode that you wish ready offline and still have a hell of a challenge to it if you had only stopped to understand that when you get access to the open beta for a game such as this a game designed to play online with other people that the developers must evaluate how the game operates under stress of course there are going to be a hell of a lot of bugs of course there are going to be faulty optimizations this is what a beta is for so that you may tell them that there are bugs and so that they may fix them i found over thirteen little glitches in the beta one included a little bug where if you tried to climb a wall and the dome fell right in front of you as you went midanimation to climb you would simply slide down the wall and get stuck halfway inside the dome when it was released yesterday i immediately went to try it out and well fixed same place probably not the exact same time in the animation but it was definitely within the time frame needed to get me stuck stop complaining about bugs if all you did was play the beta in hopes for it to be perfectokay one thing i must sit on the fence about is the dlc costs i agree that it costs too much but i disagree that its enough to make you not buy the game firstly because the dlc does not add any bonuses other than aesthetics and different characters ok cool different characters great mhm you dont need them at all whatsoever nobody said to you that in order to play this game you have to buy all the dlc or in order to enjoy the game you have to buy all the dlc not a single person but those who didnt bother reading what the dlc actually is the tier system in the game does not i say again does not give you access to new monsters and characters because theyre stronger it gives you access to them to keep you playing the game to find new play styles and combinations and weaknesses and strengths and opportunities where one persons ability might come useful where yours currently isnt that doesnt mean that you will completely forget the first character you used in a certain class no instead i went back to the original character because her toolkit suited my playstylesorry for the fairly long post everybody but i just hope that this clears any doubts that you may have had about the game be it with singleplayer issues or bugs or dlc if you have anymore questions then feel free to contact me through this account or send me an email at RIRE for reading and go slay some monsters"

Undertale,"slightly spoileryas silly as it sounds my experience playing Undertale was just that an experience gameplaywise its incredibly simple walk talk battle enemies but its how it utilizes those simple elements and creates a powerful story centered around it as you walk from point a to point b you can feel that you have made a journey youre exploring this foreign perilous world you grow attached to the interesting and quirky characters you meet and the way you face against your enemies is actively shaping the outcome of your adventure this is a game were like in real life everything has powerful consequences that you cant just run away from even if you try the age old habit of save scumming something that Undertale loves to pull apart and analyzea lot can be taken from Undertale and very rarely does a game succeed in so many ways on leaving a mark on its player many of the games concepts the deconstruction of the rpg the psychology of ingame characters and the godlike powers of a player to manipulate the games world can of course be preached by lesser artists but tobyfox has combined visuals gameplay story music and character and shaped them all into such a unique game that has proven it deserves all the recognition it getswhile i may not have the heart to play the game again i absolutely want to see other players experience it for the first time like i did please pick up this game if you have the chance its worth it"

Terraria,"let me tell of a recent adventure i had while playing this with my friendwe started on a large island wasnt as large as i thought it would be but it was large enough of course we started gathering woods first so we could have a shelter for the first night whereas my friend focused more on the framework i focused more on making our shelter look pretty by adding a japanesethemed roof once we placed the last chair the guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his our first night wasnt bad we just stayed inside made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range so for the whole night we shot zombies with our bows and arrowsthe rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that we collected woods and sometimes stones improved on our shelter which eventually turned into a tower and eventually mined we kept mining a specific network which in time lead us to the underworld now mind you we played on hardcore so if i died then i die for good on that server anywho our first trip to the underworld wasnt too bad we made a hellevator and rode it down to the underworld we scouted for a bit until we were attacked by demons when we lost more that 50 of our health we knew it was time to go back and so we teleported back home with our magic mirrorsso from that day forward our mission was to mine the hell out of hell now this is where the story ends i thought for sure that i would have died from a demon or fell and slipped into lava but no it was from something else entirely i decided to discover more of the network of caves and hope to find treasure chests here and there but no i stepped on a pressure plate and a boulder fell on me i died while my friend laughed and stole my items that was when i stopped playing Terraria then update 13 came and i was like yipee i wonder what other deadl y contraptions redigit has in store for mepls excuse bad inggris"

Csgo,"Csgo is one of the many games in the counter strike franchise it is a game i have been playing since i was a child and has been a eye opener of how much technology has advanced since counter strike started it improved and improved as time goes on and has shown me this game is worth keepingthe game is very simple you are either a terrorist or a counter terroristthe goal of the terrorist to plant the bomb at the selected sites a or b or defend the hostages from being rescued by the ctand the goal for counter terrorist defend the bomb sites and rescue the hostages but thats the main gamemode people play which is called casual there are many gamemode to choose from in this version of counter strike the gamemodes other than casual isdemolition competitive and death matchgoals for each gamemodedemolition is where you start with one gun and per every kill you get you rank up to the other gun and the goal is to the end of the game is to get the golden knifecompetitive similar to casual but stricter the game is based on a 5v5 startign with little money and a game that can go to 90 mins the reason is that it is 30 rounds and the first to 16 wins and 15 being match point at 15 rounds the team will swap and the maps are up to you to decide what you want so for example you just want dust 2 you can just tick dust 2 in your pick of the maps team killing is allowed in this gamemode so be careful when u shoot in competitive you can not free cam as you can only spectate your team mates and your self for a little bit after you die the match making is based on your skill level unranked is the lowest and the highest is global elite but dont worry what rank you are is the systems way of matching players to you death match death match is usually the game mode where you practice for competitive because aim is vital in this game death match gives you the option of picking what gun youw want and what pistol you want to practice agaisnt other players there is a point system where guns earn you points and guns being selected as random to give you more points if you do get a kill with itthere are many reason why counter strike global offesnive differs to other first person shooters 1 it is constantly being updated what differs from most fps that they dont usually tweak the game that much but in Csgo they update regularly 2 its a packaged deal you just buy it and you got everything you need without dlc execpt for gun skins to change the appearance and missions are for ways to complete tasks for a reward of a skin or case in the end 3 its cheap cs go is very cheap in comparing from the other main fps titles like call of duty battlefield etcin cs go theres also some things that most fps dont havein cs go you have set money and you can earn through kills and winning rounds to buy better guns in the game either being more accurate or have more damage health is also something different most fpss dont have for example if you are shot in the game you lose health and regenerate like most fpss right wrong in Csgo you have a set health with armour to back you up but if you are shot in the round you can not get back the health until the next round hope you love this game more than i and will be fun to see you in Csgo"
Dont_Starve,"theres your average and overrated survivor games on steam ark rust Dont_Starve etc then there is h1z1h1z1 takes place in a postzombieapocalyptict world in the normal game mode you spawn in with some bandages a flare a few other fairly handy tools and one objective survive buildings and cars around are deserted and you feel very alone first thing you do look for items this can range from weapons and tools to food and drinks the game offers many different challenges and allows you to craft much needed items with the right ingredients this game is much more fun to play with multiple people and a microphone because communication is the key to survive"

Well_There,"poor oversight by magic 2015 developers in the gamepositives include a catchy theme song ability to construct a deck to however you like storyline is not a bad inclusion opening more boosters to provide anticipation and excitementsadly however the negatives definately out weigh the positivesyou are restricted in deck building to a limited selection of cards after you have completed the campaign unless you which ti invest in boosters to increase your card pool matching up against others who have superior cards oreven duplicates or sets of 4 cards whom have purchased additional boosters not only makes deck building difficult ineffective but also increases the likelihood that you will be demorilised over and over again in matches against other opponents in 1 v 1 or free for all matchingi generally enjoy purchasing this product for the puzzle games last turn puzzles a few years ago were amazing and difficultchallanging 2014 however showcases some very sub par puzzles games and this year Well_There are nonei played one game of free for all on 4 v 4 and i felt so far away from the game table i requested my flatmate to provide me a magnifine glass myself and another player also realised 4 turns in that we had already lost when one of the players threw down some superior cards for which we had not even access tothis put me off continuing playing this game into the future as really there is no point unless i am wishing to invest into thissuggestions would be to at least bring two headed giant match making back a level par card selection by perhaps charging a set 15 fee from the start and not this micro transaction booster option which is poor oversight in my opinion and perhaps even a tournament mode where equal par magic the gatherers could paticipate tournaments of 10 players etc round robin to then provide a level based system and a decent points rating for those wishing to climb to the top in rankings over time by winning more tourneys etcrating interface music score story concept 610 as what else can you do with a story reallygameplay campaign 510 as well the ai seems to get the perfect run of cards sometimes sdeck building feature 810 as this is very flexiblecard selection 210 extremely limited unless additional investments madegameplay vs human 310 for the reason you will become frustate that you are unable to build a deck that is consistent without investment into more booster packsoverall i would probably rate magic 2015 410"

Evolve,"if i could describe this game in two words it would be beautiful and sad the game basically rEvolves around you the badger mother trying to keep your kin alive you harvest food sneak around there are birds that hunt you and yes they are frieghtening and explore the game sets a tone of bright and innocent in earlier levels and becomes dark and depressing in later stages i personally fell in love with the kin and really really wanted them all to survive but this objective was diminished in one level where it seemed impossible to get through without one of the small badgers dying leaving only a peep noise this made me very angry as it seemed like a design choice ruining my experiance but maybe this is the devs teaching us somethingyou cant always have what you want your heart will be broken and sometimes there is nothing you can do about it maybe im thinking about it too much i did cry like a little heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit when i first finished the game and was a little disappointed about the ending see previous points but overall this game was a great experiance and i highly recommend it to everyone 8510"

Terraria,"i love sending zombies sprawling from my laser minigun which i got from a martian saucer which can only be fought after defeating the golem who is the boss right after plantera who is a giant angry rose that will give you a staff to summon tikimen these tikimen are really good for taking out the mechanical bosses who are the bosses that spawn after the wall of flesh has been defeated the only to summon the wall of flesh is by killing a voodoo demon and dropping the guide voodoo doll into the lava of the underworld which is the deepest point of Terraria before going to the underworld you should take out all the prehard mode bosses"

Loadout,"here are my thoughts on dirty bombbefore i get into the positives and negatives i will give a quick overview of the gamedirty bomb is a refreshing and very enjoyable fps game brining some new ideas to the franchise and putting a spin on objective based maps and missionswith the addition of Loadouts it gives you something to work towards though sometimes it was difficultwith a variety of characters to pick from and unlock theres always a play style for you and with the free rotation the game gives you a chance to experience new characters for free whilst in the rotationquick tip pay attention to the dirty bomb facebook page they do giveaways oftenpositivesbalanced combat and enjoyable gun playbeautiful art style and great graphicsnew ideas brought to the table which are well implementedgreat designthe gameplay is fun with a variety of gamemodesnegativesnot all the gamemodes are accessable yetsome characters have to be fixed on occationproxys god damned minesthe addition of microtransaction because its expensiveconclusioneither way dirty bomb is one of my favourite games this year by far its making a huge scene for a good reasonthe gameplay is enjoyable great design balanced combatwhat else can you ask foroh aanndd its freewithout debate i would give this game a 8510 there are some things that have room for improvement"
Evolve,"this game is very fun im a huge fan of the total war series and this is a great title and probably better than rome 2 or some of the other newer titles great combat awesome seiges and you have to use a good degree of strategy to beat your opponenet but what really make this game for me is the mods the mods are the best making total overhauls or just small adjustments its what makes this game long lasting for me my favourite would be age of petty kings a game of thrones mod great fun as i conquer my enemies and crush their skulls the generals also have alot of character as they Evolve over your playthrough the spearmen are op and you can basically destroy anything with them with minimal loses in my playthrough also on my desktop which has windows eight the game crashes every time i open it be carefull about thatrecomend you get this fantastic game and replay value over 100"

Loadout,"i remember playing this game every tiem i play it with family and friends they get all depressed but when i play it by myself i get emotionally and mentally traumentized and when i beat it my best friend had to have been put in a refinement center RIRE no im joking for teh lulz it has some nice puzzles the efforts placed into the creation of the game is capital and you could learn more about the development of the game via its website or by unlocking the directors commentary for example rumpel went around his neighborhood to get ideas on maplevel design this game has at least 4 endings but i will not be a spoilering heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit and tell you about all of them however i think all of the endings aresaddening because just this once i will be an inglorious heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit simon the main protagonist kills himself if there are secret endings i hope i can find them myself the combat system is nice it forces you to choose what to use ie a baton a shotgun and finally a hunting rifle that was just an example of one of the combat Loadouts speaking of combat gameplay there is a multiplayer mode with its own storyline where you and a team of polisen trying to find simon however somehow you share the same hellish relm with our crippled david leatherhoff in a grey hoodiei recommend this game to fans of the silent hill series the resident evil seriesleft 4 dead series and finally to everyone that has played beaten and enjoyed the halflife mod afraid of monsters"

Portal,"the ball is a fps puzzler game from teol studios and tripwire interactivethe publishers of killing floor and red orchestra this is takes about 8 hours to beat like the desciption says this game is like Portal meets gears of war and why because for Portal the ball object is like the companion cube where you place that spot and place another and that and gears of wars the underground level designs and the creature aliagator things are similer to the locust soldiers and the graphics is powered by unreal engine which looks good the story was ok and the combat mechanics didnt impress me that much when you beat the game theres also a surivial mode which you must surivie which waves of enemies i give this game a 68 out of 10"

Undertale,"this is another game similar to the likes of the stanly parable it is not so much of a game and more of an experience an experience which if you do not do a huge ammount of dawdling and exploration cant last more than 2 hoursthe gameplay consists of walking through hallways listening to a narrator discuss what you are seeing the only gameplay clearly visible is the use of a simple puzzle as a mean of storytelling if anyone had trouble with that puzzle i am curious to know how you continue to function however the content taht is within the game is difficult to review its a bit like Undertale and other heavy story based games where if i mention something within the game it will ruin the experience overall though i would not say that this was an allright experience but it feels kind of like something i would have found on the likes of gamejolt for freebies rather than a 10 game even so it is still worth playing in my opinion and at the time of writing it is the holiday sale which reduces the price down to 6 which can be a more justifiable pricetag in my opinion just know that1 it is not a game2 it is entirely possible on the first playthrough to beat the game in about an hour and a half 3 the ideas explored can be done better and have a very specific person in mind which would give a great emotional response if you happen to be one of those people social anxiety otherwise it may not be a worthwhile experience4 for someone to get the most enjoyment you must be soemone who does creative work not specifically games you could be an animator artist designer ect and still get the same expereience as a game dev overall i would say for the price of 6 i paid for it i would give it a 6510 however i beleive that it should still be played for the experience that it offers"
Tf2,"first things first this will not replace your desktop no matter how much you tryit is just too inneficent to replace a wall with icons to double click and open up nearly anything with a 3d enviroment that will take time walking inbetween shortcuts the only scenario where i think aa will be faster is in the case of a webcomic where instead of going to a website click on the icon wait a second and it opens up on your 3d desktopyou are playing this game because you want points for style and my is there much style to be had here even with the basic game one example i can give is if you find a good enough map you can make rooms for different items remember this game can be mounted onto other source games meaning you can use those maps a good thing to do would be to go into the gmod workshop and find a good map mount gmod onto aa and build a map from that whilst you are on the workshop look also for ragdolls models and other objects you would want to put onto your map my map has tanks from warhammer 40k legendary pokemon an artificial forest all on a star destroyer all with all my games creative software movies music ect neatly catergorised and placed onto the map from which i can see all visually rather than having to explore a music library or look down a list of my steam games of which i have hoarded over 100 now i even have a room dedicated to comics that i had bought on comixology and i can read them straight from that roomanarchy arcade like many have said can be considered a mancave simulator i have to agree to an extent consider the possibilites of what you can do to this mancave do you want a simple appartment with quick and easy access to your items or do you want to go all out put your cave on the moon on one of those Tf2 trade servers i am working on rebuilding my cave in minecraftrealmsv2 at time of writing and will probably post to the workshop when i am finished working on it on a star destroyer or even if you really wanted to create your own map and share it to the workshop the source engine allows for that and its a matter of your skills as to whether or not you want to do that do you want your mancave to be simple videos posters music or do you want guards tanks a sphinx or my personal favourite a scarab from the halo franchice tldr this is for those who do not care for efficency and can only be considered more useful when you have too much stuff on your desktop where it becomes near impossible to read otherwise you can create the coolest desktopmancave the source engine allows for that"

Csgo,"its Csgo but way more difficult and tactical and instead of being round based its more objective based where you complete the objectives on a map blowing caches up capturing points and when you get to the end thats a roundmaps are pretty good theres a good variety of long distance and close quarters combateight different classes with different roles modular gear system chose your weapons attachments armour plate carrier etcits good i personally prefer coop mode basically vs waves of bots with unlimited capacity"

Nether,"well as i ' m sure most of you have read do not buy this game if you do not like pvp or you are not very patientas for the game itself it is rather basic atm loot spawns in predefined areas the map is rather small smaller then dayz easily there is a lot of grinding to get later tier items or to build large bases unless you raid a lot most of the guns can be hard to handle that is why i prefer the pistols and bolt action my advice to new players is to find a server that has a low pop the closer to zero the better then you can learn about the other parts of the game also a well hidden base is better than a bigger base any day everyone can break down even the mightiest fort given enough time spent 12 hours once breaking down a castle with grenades also google an online map and get used to it also take note of loot spawns and areas that have a high resource densitywooden buildings decay much faster than metal and are easier to break into when you want to build you have to craft foundations onto which you place pillars 4 in each corner depending on design you can then place a ceiling on it on which you can place more pillars since it also acts as a floor place walls windows doorways inbetween or place a stairwell in it it takes a lot of resources to build big buildings as well and then you have to maintain them on top of thatanimals also tend to spawn near loot areas but you can find some scattered around the map they are a great source of food and i have never had to go hungry past my first 3 days so actual survival is not that important if you do all right at the start once you get to high levels you will start to get bored and either want to raidpvp or build a big base after that though there is not too much you can do besides raiding and collecting airdropsgraphics are okay buggy but it is in alpha sound is okay gunshots sound nice but might need tweaking explosions need tweaking not to many glitches and i have had no crashes my self netcode seems fine heaps of servers with little lagbasically dont get this if you hate games like Nether and dayz unless you find a nice helpfull server or you dont understand what alpha is and have a short attention span i have had fun with it but it has reached a point where there is nothing new for me to do appart from kill people atm probs not worth 20 for what content you actually get but it will be interesting how they expand this and could be worth more then that in the future"

Starbound,"Starbound is a great game for players who prefere a less instense gaming style Starbound has one of the best in game sound tracks you will probably ever find with calm music for exploring the abundants of planets this game has to offer to faster music for boss fights or enemy encounters the thing i liked most about Starbound is the massive selection of different weapons and in game items you will find yourself quickly exploring numerous planets in search of coal to fuel your spaceship to travel to other planets and solar systems the way the planets in the game are randomly generatd complements this games exploraion and progressive difficulty and i would highly reccomend ths game to other players who would like a calmer deeper experience in their games"
Dota_2,"heyguysas a long time addict i would like to give a honest though undoubtedly biased review of this gamelifestyledrug playing this game is like taking yoga for 5 years training mercilessly day and night then finally surgically removing a rib in order to one day suck your own heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit only to discover that the relentless physical torment has left your junk in a hapless defective state what you will experience from playing this game is 99 flaming scapegoating and being killed by players more invested in this video game experience than you could ever hope to be the majority of mechanical gameplay consists of attacking an aicontrolled unit at the last possible moment in order to obtain a pitiful amount of gold from it and then proceeding to repeat this action hundreds of times every single game still interested i will not question what may be wrong with you but seeing as you have read thus far i will let you in to this little secret the reason why people have played this game since its inception and have never gotten bored of it this is the little 1 of pure untampered ecstasy it is the moment that the scales fall from your eyes to reveal the next level of complexity within the world of dota you once believed to be much simpler the moment you first overcome your opponent with skill you have sacrificed your blood sweat and tears to develop when the stars align and that wombo combo aces the 5 heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit boys stupid enough to challenge you and your brothers in arms when you comeback from mega creeps a checkmate in nearly all cases to snatch the victory which dangled so precariously in the jaws of defeat followed by talking so much heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit to the early good game flamer on the other team your mouth may as well be a colostomy bag this is the high you will achieve from this narcotic we call Dota_2 and you will without a doubt spend the rest of your life crawling miserably through the toxic sewerage ala public games in order to once more experience it in all of its richness and warmth truth be told there is no guarantee that you will ever feel that same way again but its worth trying i think"

Team_Fortress_2,"an interesting fps tower defense game light hearted and witty commentary and voice lines unique story and easychallenging levels of gameplay for both novice and experts alike the graphics are beautiful and have a very Team_Fortress_2 look and feel to them ive logged over 70 hours in this game and have gotten every achievement and i still have new maps to play new weapons to use and different strategies to implement i definitely recommend this game as its hours of fun for you and a friend if you wish regardless of what way you like to play up close and personal or further back and let all your traps do the work this game can cater to you but whatever method you choose to use just remember these orcs must die"

Super_Meat_Boy,"the rage Super_Meat_Boy is probably one of the most ragequitty games that i have ever played yet i still play it and try to beat the levels that i have rage quitted on in many occasions its a fun arcadeadventure game with many levels and bosses but dont judge a game by its cover it is bloody gutty vommity and ragey it even has squirrels and rabbits jumping into saws so get this game and enjoy it if you can RIRE"
Team_Fortress_2,"another great game by valve Team_Fortress_2 to me seems like an fpsrpg first person shooter role playing game because you can choose between 9 classes each with different special abilities you can also buy find and do something else that i am not aware of to get items which range from humorous hats to show off to your friends to curious crates which may hold something special within i definately recommend this game to all you pyrotechnicians and assassins and everything in between because this will give you endless hours of fun"
Team_Fortress_2,"this is the type of game that can make anyone addicted especially a low life like me gameplayin Team_Fortress_2 you play as one of the 2 teams red or blue and choose beetween nine classes each having a specific role the speedy scout the idiot soildier the mysterious pyro the drunken demoman the russian badass slash cuttie patotie heavy the layback egghead engineer the helpfull though slightly crazy medic the australian steriotype sniper and the fancy guy that looks more like he should belong in payday then he does in a game spy you can collect weapons to dominate your oponents and hats dont even get me started on hats theres a good reason as to why this game is also known as hat simulator there are so many hats that not having one is considered a sin no matter how good you are at the game if you have no hats or are running around wearing a gibus with pyrovision googles and a mecanery badge sorry but your a newb you play in a majority of fairly straight foward matches and different match types control points capture the flag payload king of the hill doomsday and the most unique being the rage inducing mann vs machiene this game is high on teamwork and your gon na get your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kicked if you go in alone it is also noticable that there are many mods that keep the pros around like the slender mod the deathrun mod and the jailbreak mod even though g mod had all of these first this game will keep you playing for a very long time due to the constant updating of new material and bugs to play around withcharacters each character is very different each other they all originated from different countrys besides the scout the soildeir and the engineer that resides in the us and they all brought theyre steriotypes with them and theyre atitudes and playstyles are so different its almost hard to beilieve that they get on fairly well graphics this is not the type of game that consentrates on being beutiful but the cartoon violence itchy and scratchy type gore is in high enough definition to satisfy most people looking for gore and yes there is a difference beetwen cartoon gore and horror gore replayability yes definitly you play as one class you get bored of that class you go on to another class and once your bored of all the clases your ready to try the first class again and as i said before this game keeps on updating keeping valve quite busy maybe thats why half life 3 hasnt been anounced also there are so many mods so many different maps and so many non porpuseful tactics cough friendlyism i just cant stop if you want a game that is fun and will last you years before you have done everything and has you slowly clawing your way to the to the top and where you meet freindsvaluable trading partners go for it its free and is very cheap too go premium gameplay 910graphics 710overall 810 play it"
The_Community,"im surprised the overall ratings for this game arent negative or mixed yet still a decent game though just buy the game and dlcs during a sale to actually play the game without spending a lot of moneyeditsince update 100 came out and microtransactions were removed the game is now going back to its roots overkill listened to The_Community and that the next generation of safes will be completely free except for the old gen youll still need to use a drill to open them the revamped skill trees introduced by update 100 have changed the way you play the game in my experience at least some skills were nerfed inspire others were buffed sentry guns and some were merged with other skills in a way this new system allows more roleplay and tactics during heists oh and the update made akimbos and the saw to be usable by default which should have been in the game from the start anyway overkill also announced that they now own all the rights to the payday franchise which means that theyll support the game throughout this year to the end of 2017 i dont know whatll happen to the game at this point overkill gained most of their fans back and they support them in return so i guess that the game will survive after all"
Team_Fortress_2,"dirty bomb is a free and very enjoyable fastpaced action shooter right up there with the likes of Team_Fortress_2 the game is fair on all player skill levels youll find many servers with a level cap ensuring that everybody gets a fair chance there are microtransactions in place but there is no emphasis on using the system as all items that can be purchases using real cash may also be purchased using ingame credits whats more is that these credits are earned very quickly and there are often events such as double xp and random loot drops which ensure that evey player gets the same opportunity to see what these toptier items are like yes i am aware that at the time of this review being written my playtime hours are rather low but that is mainly due to the fact that i am playing on old system while making do with a subpar internet connection with that being said i have made sure that i have explored most of what the game has to offer and i can come to the conclusion that diry bomb is a great game that deserves a place in everybodys steam library and after all its free"
Portal,"nothing comes close to the entertainmentmoney ratio that Portal 2 raises the bar to at least in the puzzle genre worth buying at any price"

Portal,"red trigger was an awesome experience its got a mysterious yet intresting storyline tough but good puzzles its also one of the few puzzle games that require timing making the game more unique interesting and worth playing i would love to see a concept like red trigger become a big game that lasts hours like Portal 2 its short but only made by one person with a tiny bit of assistance by others definintely an 810 especiialy because its free"

Csgo,"jesus this game has it allfirst of all this is one of only a handful of shooters that offers proper competetive gameplay for people who dont want to make a team and sign up to a website and all thatsecond this game is not pay to win you can still spend money but it all goes to cosmetics so the only factor that differs between players is their skill leveljust a quick thing the community the community in Csgo is massive and of course it has its ups and downs all communities have toxic players hackers scammers etc as well as helpers and friendly players but the one thing that strikes me about this game is that the devs gave it to us and we figured it out from there we discovered bhopping trading techniques and heaps of other stuff and that is what really strikes me about this game its that we as a community figured this game out for ourselves and even found some things that the devs didntthird the skins now personally i dont see why you would spend hundreds of dollars on an item with no beneficial value whatsoever but thats just me but apart from that the skins are actually a way of making money if you know how to trade you can go from bloody 4 cent skins to a 100 dollar knife without spending a single cent on the way ps never open cases they are a complete waste of time and moneyif you can get past the toxic players the hackers the smurfs the scammers the glitches and the plenty of other issues in the game its a blastgood luck"

Team_Fortress_2,"Team_Fortress_2 is a very fun and fastpaced game it is different from cod i hear and it may take a while to get used to but it is definitely worth itwhat i liked is the classes in generally and their funny personalitieseach class is different in such a way its hard to see how they work together so soundlywhat i dont like about this game however is the players actual people some people can be really nasty and mean it is rare to find nice people and many of those mean people have the same people noobs wearing gibus shouldnt be playing fortunately im not a gibus noobalso the fact that people dont know how to play the game properly doesnt really help your chances of successthere is a training course but that doesnt teach much just how to play to classes not how to play a gamemode the value of teamwork and it doesnt give any tipsbut above all that Team_Fortress_2 was and is a great game that should be played with friendsand its freeforever"
The_Community,"for those not familiar with what squad is its essentially the new version of project reality which was a bf2 mod back in the day and is now a stand alone title that focuses on realism patience and teamwork however the game is quite dated now and has needed a serious upgrade like this for a whilesquad is currently in its alpha and while it looks much better than pr its stripped of a lot of the features that make pr so great but rest assured these will be coming in the future ie vehicles even in alpha the game is well worth the price youre not going to find a more realistic team based modern shootersimulator outside of arma but in many ways this is much more accessible than arma as you dont need a clan or a good sized party to enjoy the full experience if you have yourself a good team who work together and know what theyre doing then youre going to have a lot of fun with the game however there are a lot of new players right now who dont know how to play the roles so some games can get frustrating most players here as in project reality use mics and youre not really going to get by without one so i recommend you have one before purchasedisclaimer this game requires teamwork communication and patience you might go an hour without getting a single kill and thats fine this isnt battlefield do not purchase this if youre not familiar with the likes of arma project reality or red orchestra or if youre not willing to learn the maps are huge with thousands of possibilities and choices when it comes to strategy and tactics the weapons are accurate sound effects are almost too real teams work together and you can see some amazing things in this game with a little initiative from squads The_Community is friendly supportive and willing to help always this is only alpha and theres so much more to come but for now what other game on steam can let you build a 50 cal position on a mountain top and rain fire on enemies kilometres away while your buddies help you with targeting and adjustments"
The_Community,"i have sunk 20 hours into this beta i dont think i have ever done that for any game in beta chosing to wait until it is a finished product but this was simply the 4x game i was looking for at the time and there are some reasons why it stands apart from other 4xs at the moment and why you might want to think about getting itunit customisation in gc3 you make military decisions from your technology choices through to the artistic choices you make for your units do you want lasers rail guns missles armor plating shields are you going to have terran looking cruisers or the most alien creations you can imagine i had a truely fun time every opportunity i had to design a new shipstar bases probably one of my favourite aspects of gc3 were the use of star bases having extra things to throw resources at when a planet has filled its current building possibilities was great and i think is missing from other 4x games there are though many finishing touches to be made to gc3 but with The_Community around it the mods that will come should make this game the 4x in space game every one has been waiting for jump in and have a play you would be hard pressed to be disapointed"
The_Community,"alright ill be completely honest herei had a lot of faith in this game when i bought it the constant updates every day or so The_Community etc until about a month or two after when updates basically halted to once every three weeks and with every update that brought content or fixes another bug would arise this game is great in its concept however leaving a game that has its whole backstoryinfluence to a russian guy is like letting an indian direct a movie about the american civil war it makes no sense whatsoever this game had so much potential for growth however it looks to be just a cashgrab for the dev as he seems to be focused on making another game and it looks to be that he is pretty much porting stuff from that game and putting it in dsjhonestly buy it if youve got the dosh to spare but dont expect much"
Portal,"who knew that a game that classified as an open world space sim could be scarier than all of the fnaf games combinedanyway onto the story after many legal trading missions with low reward i decided to do just one illegal mission it was to take 4 slaves to the neibouring system easy enough the first halve was simple as i flew close to full speed out of the station and jumped into hyperspace how hard could it be i thought to myselfout of hyperspace and heading to the starport then out of the corner of my eye i see a direct message from a federation navy ship telling me that i was a suspect and will intredict me at that point my heart was already in my mouth and the other ship about to pull me out of supercruise i finally pulled myself together and managed to line up with the escape vector still in supercruise and the navy ship is still after me the interdiction was easier this time the navy ship left me aloneuntill an enemy tried to intredict me and succeeded i thought i was as dead as the companion cube in Portal but somehow he didnt want to fight this newbie and left me alone the rest was a breese as i docked the ship and spammed the starport services button to recived my pay1312 would get this lucky again"

Team_Fortress_2,"a free game with mechs awsomehawken is one of those games you find mechs in it cool but when you start to play it you will be greated with the sight of pure fantastic visuals and fred fred is the name of your first mech as soon as you start to play you will start to go through the ranks earning many valuable and weird items along the way this game deserves to be not only on steam but many other sites aswell it may take some time to get into but when you do you will love it 6 multiplayer modes 1 mode to explore maps and 2 coop modes bot survival and coop battles the game has plenty to offer and will likely become a game nearly as popular as Team_Fortress_2 this game deserves to be played try it out you might just find yourself in a armour plaited flak cannon and rocket launcher mech you never know till you try"

Css,"war thunder is a wwii online multiplayer that aims to deliver a fun experience on all three types of vehicular combat namely air land and sea tanks are partially implemented and naval combat is in future development this game is free although pay currency and premium accounts and vehicles are present and does indeed look spectacular as a f2p and generally delivers a fun experience in its existing state however as with most mmos and f2p games there is a grind for higher tier vehicles and upgrades so this may turn away some playersunfortunately there are some inherent problems that currently exist that can marr the enjoyment for players andor those who are particularly focused on the realistic and factual aspects of this gamevarious problems include inconsistencies with damage dealt or taken factual errors of statsvehicle specifications matchmaking issues various tiersbattle rating of vehicles intermixing to large degrees and vehicle performances some of this can be attributed to the fact it is a player driven game and thus can not be 100 historically accurate unless specific constraints are implemented through player organised events or game mechaniCssome of these problems were present fairly early and still exist the developers seem to have its attention focused in pushing new content which has pros and cons though patches may generally solve some of the issues you can expect unfair tiering at timeshowever i generally look past most of the whole pay to win parts or grinding and simply squad with friends or strangers to focus on playing the game and having fun the game delivers on that regard and is relatively easy to slip into and start playing thus i would recommend this game"

Dota_2,"Dota_2 is a fun rageinducing game that requires imo around 50 hrs to grasp the idea and mechanics of the game with over 100 characters to learn master and build to the situation the game offers endless possibilities with a skill bracket ranging from complete and utter n00bs to that of professional players beware though you can be sucked into the game and possibly ruin your life RIRE"
The_Community,"ridiculously fun game spells are powerful but defenses are equally powerful so its always a matter of outthinking and outplaying your opponent the best part is the decision to exclude a mana system so theres not really any micro management going on the developers really listen to The_Community and are very public with what they are working on and going to work on"

Half_Life_2,"how to describe this source mod of Half_Life_2well first its quite a unique game one that you dont see too often anymore purely atmospheric with some very appealing lighting and graphics there is little to no music in the game leaving you walking through a quiet and somewhat eerie area even so this sets a perfect atmosphere calmly yet it still keeps you on your nervesadmittedly the story is somewhat cliche but is still portrayed quite well as you progress through new areas you meet a few new people who give you small tasks that help you towards getting off of the stranded island you are on with an unknown company blocking any outer communication these characters are not always friendly some attempting to kill you just trying to survive in this perilous land the voice actors are brilliant bringing life to the game and to the characters they playthe graphics in this game are while not perfect and somewhat buggy still quite beautiful there were multiple occasions where i would sit there for a few minutes and gaze out into the virtual horizon taking in the quiet beauty the lighting used in the maps are just worthy of a comment in itself dark areas have a dark glow to them while the happier lighter areas have a nice bright tinge to them the infected are somewhat bland looking as though they came from star trek and just have glowing yellow eyes but they dont pose a threat they are more there to remind you of the reason that you are thereas a total game i found this to be quite impressive i highly recommend this game to those with a passion for atmosphere considering this was made with the hl2 engine and is only the first act of many to come i can only wait in anticipation for the next few acts this game has impressed me quite a lot with it unique atmosphere and dramatic music as a total this game brings back what was missing in the gaming community atmosphere modern games incorperate as much action as they can sometimes not letting you take a break and take it all in but this game lets you play and take it in at the same time very impressed with this game cant wait for the next acts"
Evolve,"warning this review contains spoilers xalien isolation is a high quality aa horror game based off the 1979 movie alien in this game you play as ellen ripleys daughter amanda ripley in a time zone set between the first and second alien movie ripley and the torrens must go on a mission to the sevastapol station to unravel the truth behind her mothers disappearence only to find that the station has gone to chaos citezins going crazy synthetics have turned evil and there is also the pressence of a big fast lethal and unpredictable alienalien isolation is quite possibly the best horror game i have ever played i couldnt keep myself from it until i finished the campaign most alien games in the past have been quite disappointing and put every one to a conclusion that there is never going to be a good alien game however ladies and gentlemen i present to you creative asseblys alien isolationthe game features a huge range of gameplay sources including items found in the station used for crafting ammunition and flares a crafting system for hidden in game blueprints such as medkits smoke bombs flashbangs and some other amazing utilities a variety of weapons hidden in game such as a rEvolver a shotgun a stun baton and more terminal cmoputers with crt monitors rewire systems and save stations which i have always hated as well as a motion tracker an access tuner and a headset flashlight to help in your quest for survivalas well as the alien there are many enemies to avoid in alien isolation after a disruptance in the stations core sevastapolss environmentally friendly andriods have turned awol and are executing all located humans in the station they are indestructable to most of your utilities they can be stopped by using the stun baton emp mines or the bolt gun there are other humans on the station alive and terrified they will kill anyone they see for survival there are also facehuggers on the station as well keep them away from youthe main antagonist of the game is the alien xenomorph that proclaimed to wander out of the nest and is roaming sevastapol killing everyone in sight the xenomorph features incredible artificial inteligence that can be alerted by even the slightest bit of noise hint dont run he can go anywhere in the station via the ceiling vents the xenomorph is more unpredictable than probably any other horror game enemy i have seen he can fall out of the ceiling he can crawl through access vents and he is much faster than you if he spots you he will chase after you at a terrifying speed and once he catches you you are introduced to a death screen there are many methods of occupying the alien such as hiding in lockers cabinets and under tables using noisemakers using rewires and fire animals are terrified of firealthough this game may seem like a perfect horror game it is not the full game is 50 and has a size of 32 gbs the game is 15 hours long which is way over the average horror game time length the first half of the game is great fun and quite interesting while the rest of the game is just adding less cutscenes more frustrating tasks and more i just wan na beat the game the game uses manual save stations as its main source of saving again i hate save stations and the game is known to be really frustrating at times and sometimes unbeatableover all though this is a fantastic action survival horror id rate it a 910 this is not the best horror game of all time but if you dont mind spending 50 on an alien based horror that takes 32 gbs space spending over 15 hours on confusing and frustrating tasks and scares and relying on locating save stations throughout the campaign every time you have to leave the game then i recommend creative assemblys alien isolation 100if you are still reading this i hope you enjoyed my review now go and enjoy the game"

Undertale,"Undertale is pretty much one of the only rpgs by far where choices really do matter just like in real life and with what choice you make can eventually come back to bite youthis game is such a phenomenal approach to not only as a rpg but within the indie category of games as well if it wasnt for its unique battle screen multiple endings that one scene with mettaton in it that pays homage to final fantasy vi extremely emotional and sad ending true pacifist and most importantly its completely original storyline and soundtrack this game truely defines what a game should really consist of and this game is an excellent example of a wellmade game the storyline is perhaps the most important element and it is a really big convention of all games out there depending on what choice you make in this game even if its having the tiniest amount of exp can actually mess up your next ending the idea of the parts completely changing in the current and the next game depending on the users actions is probably one of the smartest ideas i have ever seen within a gamedont judge this game for its graphics or the massive fanbase thats like judging a book by its cover and what other people like this game is by far the best indie rpg i have ever played and i seriously recommend you give this game a shot if you havent done so yetin conclusion this game has helped me gained inspiration to study game designing in the future this game is by far what a true rpg should consist of not because of its graphics or its fanbase but for its storyline and mechanics therefore i give this game a 1010edit Undertales 1st anniversary is coming soon"

Dishonored,"Dishonored is a great game and i would truly recommend it the story is quite enthralling however not quite explained completely and the amount you are able to achieve through this character is very good the controls can be quite slow at some points but overall the controls have a good layout the abilities you will gain over the period of this game is amazing with each being necessary for any playthroughs you do which brings me to another point the fact you have a control over the way you complete the game allows you to have a sense of freedom moving through the multiple areaswhether you go big and loud or quiet and sneaky is completely up to you as is the way you do that in conclusion Dishonored is a great single player game with well thought out abilities controls gameplay and a deep and somewhat dark storyline the only cons are the slight lag in movements and that the game may get a bit repetitive if you get stuck at certain points although the changing in scenery mainly avoids this problemDishonored is truly a great game"
Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"now before i begin i havent played either of the two dlcs that add a couple extra missionsrecently during the christmas sale i purchased xcom enemy unknown and proceeded to play the living crap out of that game pretty much making it rule my christmas a few days later i saw this game on my queue and decided to go ahead and buy itthe bureau xcom declassified not only has a hard name to spell but is also a great game for a prequel to enemy unknown and the general xcom franchise for the casual gamer such as myself this game provides quickmedium length missions which are generally 2040 minutes meaning i dont get stuck for hours in game like i do for say civilizations v or Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive if youre looking for a casual game that includes a very wellmade squad command system thats not star wars republic commando seriously check it out its amazing and you dont mind the third person perspective then this game is for yoube warned this game is not an xcom game quite far from it its a well made and fairly challenging prequel to eu ive been playing on normal but from what ive gathered via others veteran mode is a fairly difficult challenge originally you will have some fps issues if youve got a toaster like myself set a couple of the graphics settings to medium or low and youll be hitting 60fps in no time some of the early levels during this game are retrieve this or save him etc but the mid to late stages of this game make it well worth it the combat is relatively annoying at first especially when you face the spoilers sorry 3 for strategiestactics ive mainly relied on the scoutcommando classes due to their abilities being useful no matter where they are on the map pros nicely paced game that doesnt stray too far from what we know and love about xcom agent carters hat is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing amazing if it gets knocked off you can even hit e on it to pick it back up amazing fits in well with the enemy unknown timeline in certain places ill come back to this later nice combat mechanics and the alien ai really knows what their doing set in the 60s how many alien games are set during the cold warvietnam war era squads can be trained up to reach high levels and you can collect alien equipment to arm them the hatcons storyline for me so far can be a bit clunky some fragments of the storyline dont fit with enemy unknown total campaign is estimated at probably 10hrs of gameplay for a casual gamer but this comes to personal preferance squad commands are a bit hard to get used to cant keep agent carters hat on for the whole game storyline issues slight spoler warningwhile i do recognize that the xcom saga hasnt been known for its whole lore shizzle whizzle some things dont add up during the events of xcom enemy unknown it is stated by dr vahlen that they have never seen these aliens before hang on a sec this is set in the 60s while eu was in 2015 i realise that firaxis2k may not have anticipated that this game would overide their original script for eu during enemy unknown we must also research plasma and laser technology however i can bring home weaponry that includes both laser and plasma based weaponry to conduct research overall this game started out fairly well with me but after a while it came out brilliantly the story revolving around the main character is a bit clunky and doesnt make sense with eu and ew however id reccomend this game to the casualcompetitivediehard xcom gamer who wants a 3rd person tactical game that has the backing of a major developer such as 2koverall rating 710thank you for reading this if you stayed this far ive been considering starting a curator pageyt channel so let me know what you thinkps muton elites will literally destroy you unless you spam the living heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out of it"

Tf2,"after playing hours and hours of the old ace of spades see buildandshootcom i bought this game with high anticipation and excitement sure this game is a minecraft Tf2inspired fps combat that feels relatively new in a genre that is completely overratedits fastpaced combat certainly sets it away from a crowded fps genre and its zombie mode is surprisingly the best mode in terms of balance and fun another positive is that it offers map editing and the ability to share custom mapssadly each of ace of spades four classes certainly have their pros and cons which significantly imbalance the game depending on gamemode for example the rocketeer jetpacks across the map with an smg in capture the flag which seems unforgivably lopsided furthermore the minecraft building aspect seems untouched and is hardly used which is also hampered by a bugged reticule"

Portal,"Portal 2 is an experience that must be played to truely understand what it is is it a shooter or a puzzle game the answer is both Portal was one of the games that defined this generation of gaming among other valve creations raising the bar for the quality of the sequel i am happy to report that it does not dissapoint with 3 new charactors wheatley cave johnson and caroline Portal 2 delivers a plot that is perfect in nearly every way adding to the original but not taking away alongside the many charactor developments and plot twists that i will not mention you have to see for yourself gameplay is beautiful the added mechanics make for more interesting puzzles than in the first game and many more of said puzzles the aperture science handheld Portal device or the Portal gun is back and better than ever you get the Portal gun towards the start of the game and keep it until the end you will encounter many new challenges that you must solve up until the end the end of the game is something that should not be spoiled but i will tell you that it does not dissappointafter the singleplayer experience the game keeps going into the new coop mode playing as one of two bots with your friend controlling the other makes for an interesting experience yes this means there are two Portal guns and yes this means that there are four Portals these puzzles are challenging depending on how well you do if you sit in the corner not contributing you will not get through the first puzzle in the coop campaign there are many moments in coop where you just feel like having fun and playing tricks on your partner which the game lets you do it is obvious that this game will put your friendship to the test with voice chat and your ping tool you have ease of communication so you cant blame the game for that these tools are quite fun and easy to use so there is no learning curveto summerize Portal 2 is definately worth the 20 it costs and even more worth it when it goes on sale ive replayed the singleplayer many many times and enjoyed the game all the way through my play time of 100 hours Portal 2 gets a 1010"

The_Community,"the best word to describe verdun would be brutal but in a very very good wayoverall opinion fantastic historical a damn good game and well worth the price if its on sale its a mustverdun one of the most historically acurrate games ive ever played from being hit by gas attacks to being shot mid stride and watching your body slump down into the mud and battling it out in trench warfare on some of wwi most know battlegrounds most weapons are extremly satisfying to use with most rifles downing a charging enemy or and entreched one in one shot pistols maybe taking 2 shots on average but having the advantage of being semiautomatic making pistols extremly formidable even at long range this game will make you work espically in the trench warfare mode where this game comes into its own you will push up to cover or the enemy trench most likely die in the process but you know youll do it again because there is that chance you will make it into that cover or arrive into the enemy trench bayonet at the ready verdun succeeds in creating a very tense atmosphere from merly lying in nomans land waiting for your squad or slowly creeping through the enemy trench knowing that your probably going to get shot from behind you and your team will have to rtry and detremine which part of the enemy trench is the least defended or create a space for your team mates to enter the teams i have played on usually worked together i havent really noticed much toxicity which is a postive thing and i hope it stays that way although it can be daunting for new players as getting shot from seemingly no where can be frustrating and not hitting your mark on long shots because you werent compenstating for bullet drop and travel time can be slightly most players will pick things up like compesation and not standing straight up at the edge of your trench or in the middle of nomans land overall this is a history buffs wet dream and damn good shooter very solid for an early access game although its missing a few minor things id love to see them add more battlefields and more forces like gallipoli which would hopefully cause the devs to add the anzac forces to the game for which the australian and new zerland members of The_Community would be very grateful for also the addition of more blood and gore would add to the already fantastic immersion im sure the decs will continue to polish and improve this game and i cant wait to see what it becomes"

The_Community,"excellent game recommended for people who like moba massively online battle arena games it involves teamwork as well as skill inorder to play this game and although it takes quite some time to master and learn the basics of the game but once you get the hang of it it really is something interesting although The_Community is a little toxic and harsh however once you get to the higher levels or you play with friends it will definately be an enjoyable experience overall i rate this game a game worth trying as it is really a gem in itself and be it old or new players there is always something new to learn"
Csgo,"counterstrikeglobal offensive is a tactical firat person shooter i personally enjoy Csgo because how it is a mix between aim and strategy this allow this game to much more in depth and enjoyable also Csgo has every gun available from the start so no player has an advantage this makes Csgo all about how good you are and your team teamwork is essential in Csgo thats is something i find is needed in todays games working as team not indiviudally Csgo is a very well thought out game and will always be remebered by me and the gaming community"

Evolve,"kane lynch 2 we should have stopped at onethe first thing i noticed with this game was a headache i mean the shaky cam gave me a headache and for the first time in my life i got to experience motion sickness once i figured out where they hid the option for the shaky cam hint its in the controls section i finished the main game in only 3 hours without rushingthe main story rEvolves around kane and lynch getting together for one more job everything goes to hell and you shoot your way out that is pretty much the whole story right there i wish i was kidding right nowthe game was short repetitive and for the most part downright awful aiming sucked the coverbased mechanics were subpar and the story was nowhere to be found the graphics while alright in some places were stitched together with overused lighting effects and what j j abrams would consider to be too many lens flares this was likely used in an attempt to hide their rushed graphicsthey also do this weird thing in the game where they censor headshots you shoot someone in the head a big blur spot appears and breaks immersion if you want to kill a game this is a good place to start was it supposed to be artistic like the shaky camim really not sure there is much to recommend with this game i barely stuck with it long enough to finish itgraphics 610 once you turn off shaky camstory 210 hey were shooting people thats a story rightgameplay 510 it was playable not much elseoverall 310 i dont know the game sucked and caused me physical pain from trying to play itnot recommended"

Csgo,"has to be the best fps ive ever played infact its probably up in my top 5 games of all timeto start im not a serious hardcore gamer but this got me really addicted and have played over 20 hours in the past week i mostly play competetive and deathmatch but theres also other modes such as casual if you dont want to be involved in ranks or waiting for the 20 hour cool down after playing too much competetivedont get intimidated by the fact of buying guns and knives because they are simply just skins and dont give the player that spent 400 on a knife any advantage over the player that spent 0 however the cool thing about steam is being able to sell cards and other items which you can use to purchase weapons or buy crates and keys to have a chance to win better guns and knivesyou do get a few hackers and afk players every know n then but they are easily kicked with the easy team voting system the main problem i have is smurfs which are players that make other accounts and may seem as a low rank but actually have a higher rank making them unfair as they play with lower ranks even though they are much more skilledfinally gamplay the gameplay is very smooth and well thought out low rank players play with low rank players and high rank players play with high rank players all guns have their advantages and disadvantages such as long range short range recoil damage fire rate and accuracy each map has well placed objects which can be used as coveroverall this game is a must i reccommend Csgo to any fps gamer or even any average gamer in general"

Tf2,"this game is unique it is like bringing a mmorpg to a fps game and it is amazing the way valve design this game is brilliant every class and weapon has its own strength and weaknesses plus adding things such as taunts and hats makes it more fun and hilarious but the most amazing thing about Tf2 is that you can be an idiot or a fool and no one will get mad even sometimes people will be a idiot with you it is a game nothing like coc or rift it is a legit fun game where you can laugh your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off and never get bored especially with friends i highly recommend it"
Dota_2,"awesomenauts is a fascinating game i mean come on a 2d moba shouldnt be good but it is awesomenauts flawlessly combines a platformer with the moba genre the game is balanced a lot better than Dota_2 or RIRE it has an easy to use interface is highly accessible and always actionpacked this game simply put is outstanding for a moba 8510"
Dota_2,"ah valve why do you torment us so Dota_2 is a moba as many people would probably know due to this game being the most played on steam Dota_2 is a solid game and i would say due to the nature of the games genre being a rather unpopulated market the best one in the moba genre i say this for a couple of reasons but i will list those later Dota_2 stills holds much to warcraft 3 the game it was based off of now Dota_2 attracts me for a few reasons those being its very simple but effective party or solo play the potential profit that is able to be made and of course my affnity for strategy games being a free to play game Dota_2 is amazing valve did a brilliant job n it and altough things could be improved in some areas it is still a perfect example of what valve is capable of pros excellent combatvariety of heroesvariety of itemsexcellent party system gripping game that has the potential to reach high tension when victory is unclear level system works wellpurchaseable items are only for cosmetic effect keeping the game balanced potential gold mine for economically minded playersconssome broken heroesmatchmaking theyll never get it rightcommunity is mean to newcomerstutorial is boring and does little to encourage playverdict 910 one of my favourite games on steam if they just fixed up the minor things wrong with the game itself it would be more deserving of a better rating"
The_Community,"its about time i reviewed this game europa universalis iv is simply amazing i pour a lot of my extra time into this game and are never disappointed with the game the newest update to euiv added a lot of new features for free something that is rare in this age of gaming developer support simply the best ive seen in years paradox are one of the few companies that dont milk their customers for money and actually listen and respond to The_Community euiv is updated regularly and every now and then a massive update comes out even though this game has an incessant amount of dlc dont allow that to throw you off unlike the civilization franchise of late you need no dlc to enjoy this game much of the dlc is for a more in depth experience and reminds me of a crowdfunding system graphics the graphics of euiv arent going to win any awards anytime soon but they fit the game and its genre most of the graphical elements within euiv is the map itself and there is decent detail for this military units naval and army are rather generic and bland and this is where the main clump of dlc comes in most of the dlc are visual enhancements to the game adding varied unit appearances in terms of the gui i personally love it the gui without any menus up is rather spartan but provides all nescessary information to the player with menus however is where euiv shines the menus are complex and indepth easy to navigate and sometimes a bit unclear difficulty ill say it now if you have no patience you are probably not going to like euiv the game has a steep learning curve in comparison to most strategy games and that can be accredited to the game sitting by itself in its own subdivison on strategy it is neither and rts or tb but rather an rts that is pauseable ruining the entire purpose of an rts to new players menus can be confusing and war may be a major attractor to new players personally i say learn the menus first then unpause the game gameplay gameplay in euiv can be boring if you let it be most of the time the game attempts to keep you involved with events and issues around your country ive had a friend turn away from this game due to them not bothering to learn the menus and hopping right in as sweden then he immediately declared war on his overlord not pretty war is painful in this game to conduct properly and to be honest it is extremely hard to play as a noneuropean civilisation once the colonial countries come all in all euiv is worth every dollar with an excellent developer who supports their game and listens to The_Community and an invloving behemoth of a game it is truly worth the 40 i payed"

Dota_2,"Dota_2 has been the most addicting game ive played till now besides for minecraft ive played around 100 games although not many ive been playing with a lot of heroes the only problem ive seen is that some hero is really annoying especially rikimaru rikimaru can be countered with wardsdustgem and really squishy in early game but in low ranked games people dont know that they usually just stay there getting xp and then when riki blinked strike them they run away and let riki get fat i really suggest nerfing riki a little bit early game just to make him really squishy make him not and easy hero too nerf his skill a little bit so people dont always win after getting a fat riki overall this game is awesome i seriously recommend it for you people"

The_Community,"i have noticed in the review section of this game that a lot of people are giving this game more of a negative rating rather than positive which is quite frankly true pre patch 137 7810patch137 10patch 137 was supposedly to make the game better in the way it was more balance RIRE infact it made it worse throught my few hours playing the game after patch 137 i have come to believe that gaijan have become greedy like activisiontreyarch in the ye old days like 129 you could quite easly come out of a match making around 1020k profit depending on whether you have premium or not i not saying this because im bad but here are 3 reasons why gaijin had screwed up the game after patch 1371 matchmakingafter 10 games in the new patch im not sure if it was unlucky or absoluty garbage i prefer to play in the british line up while using stuff like the wellington beaufighters ect the problem i was having is i would get over the bombing target in my wellington ic and then be killed by 8 fighters who can climb to your altitude within a matter of minutes which resulting into easy killsaircraft have now been sorted in tiers rather than ranks you may think that is true but infact its the complete opposite the aircraft may be a tier 3 but the battle rating which can be found while hovering over the aircraft is the acctually ranked lobby you will be put in for example the mustang mk1a which is a british fighter is a tier 4 but its battle rating is 53 they say they would be changing this but can we really believe them2 leveling upprier to patch 137 if the people who are reading this just started you had ranks rather than tiers like any game you get kills lionsxp more aircraft kills which was all good you could quite happly level up now you need to research the aircraft the developers said this new system would acctually help you unlock aircraft quicker wrong infact it would take you 45x long to get a single plane in the game for example the f80c shooting star you need 3200rp to unlock if you get an average of 13k rp for that aircraft note not all rp earned in a game goes towards an aircraft the rest is stored so you can use it later but there is a twist it would take you atleast 100150 games to unlock and a normal game goes for 20 mins20x15031002441 so it would take you around 12 days of non stop gameplay to unlock it lies3pay to playas this person has explained beautifully on the war thunder forumsso let me sum up it here instead of playing and enjoying the game gaijin wants the players to 1buy gold 2buy premium 3 play the game a lot 4 realize you cant do it without premium aircraft buy premium aircraft 5 lose your xx on repair bills because you cant use your fully upgraded lower planes for higher level plane research xp 6 use your golden eagles to buy lions at exorbitant rates 7 rinse and repeat stop locking these threads people need to know what gaijin did stop censoring the threads mods your job is not censor the posts of the paying members and communities response we all know the mods are purposely locking these threads trying to downplay The_Community response to this patch which is designed for one reason and one reason only to make the game take much longer and force a whole lot more golden eagle purchases we are not stupid we can see right through you digital zombielink httpforumwarthundercomindexphptopic89224researchreallyas you can see gaijin have become so full of themselfs they cant control what they have become without starting over many people would agree that dont waste your time on this game till they get there heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit togetherregards shifty"
Portal,"i really am not sure what to think of Portal 2 the charm of the first is lost though this doesnt make it a bad game at its core Portal 2 is a simple puzzler in an fps shell and offers a great distraction to more indepth gamesits definately not half life type awesomeness and i guess you need to expect that though i would sacrifice both Portal games for another entry into the half life universe i will put this just under bejewelled in regards to great puzzlers 70100"

Tf2,"when i first got this game i spend about 100 hours getting skills and getting ready to take on online people and pros this time was well spent as i was playing so much better than some players that went directly to multiplayer for new players offline bots do help a lotnow i was up to the stage where i felt that i needed that paidtoplay ptp so i went ahead and got it the second i got that ptp it opened up so much more of Tf2 than what it was like before ptp however after finding my first hat ptp Tf2 players will find that Tf2 was almost a mans dressup game or as most people would call it now a hat simulator as ptp it is important that you dont get fustrated when you dont get stuff you want even though you find items about 1550 faster than freetoplay ftp usersthen it happens again but this time you unboxed your first unusal everything changes again and the game becomes much more exiting i found that most players that have unusals kind of going to use a common ftp reference like to train and become better at that specific class as ftp you will see peeople wearing those unusals and become either jealous fustrated that they are so good and sometimes call them hackers and who knows maybe they are hackingbut overall you can worry about how good you look but just look good in those freeze cam and show how good looking you are but that shouldnt stop you actuly being a ftp and playing the game even though you are ptplastly what you should note about Tf2 is that it isnt repetive like some games like neverwinter etc there is always going to be new players with new styles of gameplay that makes this game very interesting too reguard less if they are ptp or ftpmy final thoughts this game is great also makes a good time killer if you have some spare time on your hands this game can keep you hooked for hours on hand and as ptp you do a lot of trading so sometimes is good to watchout for scamers or people in high demand for something in addtion this game is extreamly good looking as well in both gameplay and graphics Tf2 is going to be a hard one to beat 910"

Metro_2033,"long story short a runofthemill modern military shooter with a meaningless and short singleplayer campaign while neat with graphics and sound the 15 seems a bit too much on a rather easy and generic 6 hour game pass it unless youre very interesteddisclaimer while i havent played the sequel yet metro last light ive heard a lot of the narrative is improved upon with that game i have also not played the redux versions as of yetMetro_2033 is a first person shooter that takes place in the tunnels of moscow in the somewhat distant future you play as artyom a dude who is trying to get to the other side of the subway to save his hometown from mutants on the way you encounter bandits creatures and a strange supernatural entitywhile the goal of the singleplayer is made clear from the start it quickly loses track as you meet up with other characters and basically go through escortlike areas with them its hard to keep focused when youre constantly meeting different people and experience different kinds of gameplay for example one moment youre fending off a minecart from mutants the next youre sneaking through a bandit hideout stealthily killing each person you find the next youre walking down a corridor talking to a guy with very little coming at you each with some different npc leading you the whole journey feels disjointed and inconsistentthroughout the game you acquire a bunch of weapons most of these function a bit differently but some just seem outright pointless like the ball bearing shooter which can barely even damage enemies runs out of ammo quickly and occupies the same slot as the shotguns my biggest issue with the weapons is that theres very little variety theres nothing past pistols assault rifles and shotgunsthese weapons can be found on the ground alongside medkits which quickly restore your health and gasmasks which basically are a time meter for above ground sections my issue with the medkits is that the game is a coverbased shooter where all of your health eventually regenerates in gunfights with other humans medkits are only there to save time rather than hiding behind cover in fights with mutants medkits are pointless as the regenerating health mechanic pretty much saves you from any hits that the mutants do provided you dodge their attacks a bit all of these items are also sold in shop areas which appear in the first half of the game they oddly never appear again after chapter 4 i believe an interesting concept here is that bullets are the currency of the game my issue with this is that the kind of bullets that are used as currency are also the weakest bullets which removes the whole purpose of themso the gameplay has you going through a bunch of different locations meeting a few different kinds of enemies youll fight humans who all hitscan you if you move out of cover the gameplay for these guys is pretty generic and bland while their ai is good in moving into cover and such theres just no variety between them throughout the game the other kinds of enemies are the mutants theres a few different kinds but they all can only melee attack you making running backwards in circles and firing wildly an unfortunately effective method these enemies also deal a surprisingly low amount of damage even on harder difficulties making them very easy and nonthreatening targets which is a shame as theyre supposedly the huge threat of the storytheres also a few stealth sections in the game artyoms watch has a coloured light section that indicates how well seen you are but at least for me it doesnt work all that well theres been times where ive hit the red light and have still been able to run through unnoticed other times the light is green and i start getting shot at stealth is a very weak element of the game and fortunately or unfortunately it only comes up three times in the gameof course theres a lot of onrails sections where youre on some sort of moving vehicle and youre shooting at stuff these vary the story up a bit but in general are a bit easier than the rest of the game and lack the depth or challenge that youd be expecting during these usually explosive sequencesi dont know if its just me but i experienced a lot of bugs with the game theres the above stealth system which sometimes doesnt indicate the right thing ive had ai glitch up and run into walls constantly ive had times where a scripted sequence at the beginning of the game ended to my death ive had times where the ui would not come up the worst one i had though was that my gas mask would not come off my face which was okay at first however with the gas mask taking damage starts to crack the visor making it extremely difficult to see and since i couldnt take it off i was forced to play through literally half the game with my screen almost obscured loading a save or checkpoint wouldnt fix itgraphically the game looks alright depth of field and fancy lighting and particle effects makes the tunnels and overground look starkly different the sound is also done alright the music builds up at the right times although its pretty generic and the sound design works well as sounds echo in the tunnels and fade off in the overground sectionsunfortunately the engine can not make up for the games shortcomings Metro_2033 was not that enjoyable for me i played through the game twice once on hard and once on ranger hard which hides the ui and makes everything including you die very quickly both playthroughs were plagued with issues for me i didnt enjoy the game that much mainly because it was short and didnt offer anything substantial in terms of gameplayand thats a shame because my friends tell me theres a great story tucked away underneath it all its just i was too focused on the gameplay to really experience that theres a couple of side things to collect and theres a second ending that isnt purely a decision at the end of the game but especially the ending i felt that the game was giving me mixed messages about who was the good guy in the story which would be fine if it was a bit more clearcut what the implications of my decisions wereMetro_2033 is a modern military shooter first and foremost if you like those kinds of games you may find something good here the setting is unique and ultimately you might have a good time with it however if you like me dont like those kinds of games

Portal,"if you come into this game expecting orcs must die 3 or something like RIRE or dota than your going to be dissapointed that doesnt mean this game is bad by all means its a great game the general gameplay of seige mode pvp is really fun the trap building is very cut down to a basic form compared to the other orcs must die games but adds a level of strategy to dealing with incoming waves this is understandable as your focus is on this pushhold gameplay style but to ultimately break through the other teams rift room jungeling in this is not really a thing its destroying caches and getting minion Portal upgrades which is essential to win and doing this playstyle means you need to know when to support your team during pushes survival mode is the pve gamemode where you defend your rift against waves of enemy minions this mode feels lacking especially if youve played the other orcs must die games most of the time if your team isnt dumb or your down a player you will win games dont feel long enough or are not difficult once youve figured out how to force minions the long way survival does need improvements and hopefully later in development it gets better not saying its not enjoyable just that gets bland after a 35 games in one play sessionfree to play means pay to win right no sure you can get a boost from paying for heros and chests but doesnt mean that if you dont buy you will have to grind to be good at the game the grind isnt too bad for traps and minions which determine your strategy of winning however for heros and other things will take longer to obtain in my opinion buying the calssic hero pack is not worth it and the grind for them is find for free to plays"
Tf2,"this game this game this game has brought numerous gamers countless hours of fun and procrastination this game may not bring much to the table in terms of gameplay and it may come across as a childish and perhaps overrated game and maybe just maybe youre right but let me tell you what has been told a million times before this game is ridiculously funseriously no money to hand over no advertisements and you start with a fair bit for a f2p game this is singlehandedly the best multiplayer game i have ever played from its ever expanding community do its deep roots with the past to its ever changing gameplay this game is amazing not only that but the openness of the game must truely push the source engine to the limitim going to stop ranting now do you have 15ish gb of internet to spare on a game that will stay alive for years to come you do then get the gameall those pictures of spycrabs and rapping demomen will make so much more sense when you actually start playingedit i have just gone through the negative section and 90 of the negative posts go something along these lines Tf2 has hats hatsruined game seriously if you dont like trading are tired of getting scammed think the trading community is bad then guess what dont trade hats arent an integral part of Tf2 ive met many good players who wear gibus for the sake of getting surprise kills there are three types of people who play Tf2 the players the traders and the mvmers please invest in them all its a good learning experience heck when you become and experienced player you can help other new players but please if you do find a reason good enough to drop the game comment it below i would love to hear it 3"

Evolve,"having only played 1 out of the 5 parts of this game thus far i feel i need to first note that ive seen a few promising starts in video games go down the tubes by the time you get to the end in that regard life is strange is quite capable of letting us down it has mysterious and fantastic elements which while excellent for drawing the crowds in at the beginning will really demand some great writing later on in order for us to feel satisfied with the way theyve been used by the end some games give us intriguing beginnings such as this yet eventually begin to feel too convoluted to enjoy or that their fantasy elements feel so tacked on by the end that they become all but meaninglessthat being said what ive seen of life is strange thus far gives me no cause to doubt that these developers are giving us a memorable staisfying and perhaps even life changing experience piece by piecepart 1 delivers us a wonderfully characterdriven story filled with intrigue drama thrills and so much depth its immersive as hell you cant help but feel like you really are max every second your playing this game living her dramas reliving her old memories and agonizing over her impossible no right answer dillemmas the rest of the cast of characters are so unique believable and well fleshed out this would have to be the most impressive aspect of the game thus fargameplaywise life is strange is more an interactive movie then a traditional computer game most of the game rEvolves around handling social interactions in just the right way to produce the outcome your most happy to live with bad choices will come back to haunt you apparently but that being said there are plenty of practical puzzles to keep oldschool gamers who were reared on myst ect happy without dropping any spoilers the way the game handles time is an enjoyable little innovation though perhaps gluttons for a challenge might think it makes the puzzles too easystylistically this game reminded me of alan wake though its nowhere near as gothic yet certain elements like the geography vague supernatural elements that only afflict the protagonist use of music and especially the turbulent fantasy segments involving creepy lighthouses just made this game feel like it was a child or some other relative of alan wakesone thing i really have to complement about this game is the visual style even though the graphics arent photorealistic there is real and constant beauty in the look of this game especially in its use of light but more then simply being pretty the visual style of life is strange is also brilliant as the outer beauty of arcadia bay is in stark contrast to much of the ugliness and unhappiness that hides behind it you cant help but notice how these two elements of the game clash and you just know that this isnt happening by accident small wonder that we also find ourselves with a plain protagonist who is actually quite beautiful where it counts and a beautiful villainess who is ugly and cold on the inside you cant judge any books by their covers in life is strange the fact that photography is such an important aspect of our protagonists character also betrays the fact that life is stranges visual style has been very carefully managed to suit the story by clever diligent developersall in all from what ive seen thus far i couldnt not reccomend this game to anyone who loves an engrossing storybased adventure potential for pitfalls aside everything i just experienced in my playthrough left me thoroughly impressed i cant wait to see what happens next"

Nether,"from the zero punctuation reviewthere have been many rpgs that let you define your characters personality to a certain extent say youre given a quest to get a schoolgirls cat down from a tree on average youll be given three options neutral where you get the cat down and accept the schoolgirls allowance as payment good where you waive the fee and fondly tousle the schoolgirls hair as she scampers off and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit where you set fire to the tree and jump up and down on the schoolgirls faceand speaking as an heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit this offends me there are so many wonderful ways to be a complete ponce that these games rarely cater for why cant i rescue the cat but hold it to ransom for her dads porn collection or get the cat down by throwing rocks at it so it breaks all its legs on the concrete and then still expect to be paid with the infuriatingly infallible logic of a complete tosser why cant there be an rpg that covers the entire heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit spectrum well good news ponce fans now there isalpha protocol follows mike thorton a member of a covert us government agency with strong ties to a private military company that might as well rename itself kitten stranglers plc he gets betrayed goes rogue has to work alone to build a case against them blahdee blahdee blah but whats important is that however you play him mike thorton is the is the ponciest ponce that ever ponced past a poncing parlourthe dialogue system lets you switch between three attitudes a professional by the book sort of ponce who wouldnt emote if the angel gabriel blow off in his face an aggressive ponce who sounds like hes five seconds away from snarlingly flipping the global crisis onto its front and pounding away at its Netherhole with a franchi spas12 and the suave ponce who might as well just save time and mace himself every time he opens his heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing mouth best of all even if he only ever talked about his favorite breakfast cereal hed still sound like a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit because the voice actor delivers every line in the level smug tones of a highbrow film critic archly dismissing the latest superhero blockbuster as he spoons himself another helping of baby seallets get the good over with quickly for once this is a game that claims that every action has consequences and actually means a consequence more significant than a character maybe wearing a different hat for example although the hubbased mission system lets you do the operations in any order during the one i chose to do last an informant mentioned the previous operations id completed in conversation heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit i said this games just showing off now so i immediately became an aggressive ponce and slammed his head into a desk after which there was more security in my next mission because the informant went crying to his big brother or somethingthe rpg action stuff reminded me of deus ex in a good way its nice to see a game where your character has to work on their gun skills and cant expect to draw their pistol and immediately hit the on button on a tumble dryer from nine hundred years and i was also impressed by the lockpicking and hacking minigames which nicely balance skill and incremental difficulty and i cant think of a joke for that sentence so heres a picture of a dog in a hatthe thing about deus ex though was that you could arguably specialize completely in combat or stealth or hacking or playing the cello and still beat the game even the final encounter had equal parts monsters security systems and incomplete string quartets to allow any approach alpha protocol on the other hand is happy to let you sink all your points into learning to waltz only to find yourself stuck in an unavoidable freestyle disco competition i was a stealthclose combat specialist and there was this particularly obnoxious boss fight that i couldnt sneak out of and whose cqc attacks wrecked my heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit i had to inexpertly spray at him with an assault rifle i knew as much about as i did a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing nuclear reactor then whenever he got his knives out let him chase me around the room like benny heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing hillthe skills you can upgrade are stealth handtohand combat and then four kinds of guns which i feel makes little sense why the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit would anyone specialise in shotguns when a shotgun is a situational weapon what are you gon na do if theres an enemy more than ten feet away throw your shoes at himthe dialogue system gives you about one second to pick a conversational attitude that is summed up in one word and its often hard to decipher you might be talking to a sexy lady for eg when suddenly an option comes up reading say trousers and theres no way of knowing if this means the poncemaster general will change the conversation to the subject of trousers or draw attention to a specific pair of trousers sneaking up behind them or whatever so you select it out of panic whereupon el ponco promptly pulls his trousers down and slaps his bum while mooing like a lost calf spoiling your reputation with the character somewhatdialogue seems a bit buggy at times too which i guess is inevitable with conversation trees as labyrinthine as this there was a moment when i was gabbing away with another sexy lady when the option came up to initiate a quick knobbing which went down reasonably well then afterwards she started repeating dialogue lines shed been spouting beforehand wow i thought i literally heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ed her brain outthere are a couple of other bugs here and there like how the distinction between a wall you can take cover on and the ones with poncerepellent wallpaper is known only to mr thorton but none of them got in the way too much because after a while my stealth skill was so high i could literally turn invisible and run around instakilling every possible threat with my bare hands and nothing could pose a challenge after that short of the invention of some kind of ponceseeking missileall in all alpha protocol is weak and poorly balanced like a threelegged dog with an eating disorder but i want to come back to the story for a bit you know that extremely brief summary i gave about five paragraphs ago thats literally the extent of the plot i understood the rest was an incomprehensible miasma of factions motivations and betrayals through which i was just dumbly acting with zero understanding towards the end a line of dialogue got drowned out just before a boss encounter and i honestly didnt know if i was supposed to be killing or protecting the guy maybe this would be helped through repeat playthroughs oh sega you crafty heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit es"

Evolve,"this is a free to play pay to progress but only to speed up progress fast paced and highly competitive first person shooter dirty bomb features mercenaries tasked with retrieving or destroying objectives in return for credits in a london devastated by a you guessed it dirty bomb there are currently five maps in rotation with several more in development testing but they all provide a fairly balanced and fun layout to play with and the new maps look to be getting even larger which will be good hopefullythere are three gamemodes currently stopwatch objective and the newly added still in testing execution game mode stopwatch rEvolves around both teams trying to complete the objectives for the chosen map faster than their opponent after which they switch sides attackers to defenders and the winner is decided on the faster team objective mode is simply stopwatch without the team switch and as such one team defends the objective the other attacks it until time runs out or all objectives are completeexecution mode is relatively new and consists of 10 rounds where the teams attempt to win more rounds than the other by playing the objective or killing all the enemies on the map this mode has the added rule that when you die and are gibbed stabbed so that a medic can not revive you you will need to wait til the next round begins to continue playing medics can revive provided you are not executed ala the game mode titleenough about the modes you probably understand the only thing you need to objective uhbjektiv play that and you win simple onto the characters or mercs there are currently 14 mercs available for play with the newest being phantom a stealthy melee oriented class who has caused some controversy as to what the game is aiming for the mercs each have a subcategory which are as follows fire support classes arty whom can call down artillery with his targeting designator from afar and provide his team with ammo via ammo packs kira who loves to light up the sky with her orbital laser strike which she can guide around using the laser tool to cause maximum precision chaos from safety she also deploys ammo stations to keep teammates well stocked throughout the fight skyhammer one of the free mercs you get right off the bat who has the ability to throw an airstrike marker to gib and demolish his foes and also damage certain objectives such as generators and the ev when defending kira and arty can also damage these objectives skyhammer will oft throw ammo packs like his fellow support class arty recon classes vassili the sniperest sniper there ever was vassili was the first of the recon classes added to open play and can be devastating to enemy pushes if he can aim and position well his heartbeat sensor can be vital to knowing enemy movements phantom the allamerican hero in his own mind this backstabber is aimed at executing medics and other squishy vital classes his ability is a cloak that makes him fairly invisible the cloak can be removed with vassilis heartbeat sensor if the two come in close proximity medic classes aura the shotgun wielding heal station hero who keeps the team healed and happy alive not dead her main ability is a healing station she can place nigh almost anywhere on the map which heals in a small radius and can almost outheal all damage sources if placed right she can also revive fallen teammates with the defib paddles aura along with skyhammer is one of the mercs you get for free sawbonez the exmilitary cqc smgspecialist who throws large healing packs potent enough to bring even the most deathly ill back to the land of the living and doing it with style sawbonez with a z also holds the key to close range life and death with his defib paddles sparks the super fast gal with a hundred names and a wonderful piece of reviving and sniping technology sparks can reanimate people from afar with her revivr gun which when charged is equally as good at reviving teammates as it is at killing enemies sparks has far less potent healing packs in contrast to sawbonez but they are no less helpful in a pinch engineer classes proxy the savvy and snappy brit who loves to sap the lives of her foes via proximity mines strewn across the map proxy is also an objective specialist who has a 50 boost to completing objectives such as repairing generators the objective specialist is present on all engineer classes fletcher who is the best thats why he costs more no but seriously fletcher is an engineer with an explosive surprise sticky bombs create traps ala proxy style cover objectives or doorways that are important or else use them as renewable grenades bushwacker the man with the extra gun bushwacker comes equipped with a turret buddy who can be placed almost anywhere needed but for best results try placing them on flank routes or behind where you will be fighting and get a nice crossfire going the turret is fairly weak healthwise but can pack a good punch with its firepower if placed right assault classes nader the business lawyer turned merc who has a renewable dont ask me how grenade launcher which can spit little eggs of death or was that dess im not bilingual im afraid nader can shut down areas of defense and offense if her nades are utilised correctly and even if she dies she comes back post mortem with an explosive surprise called matyrdom where she detontates herself and any nearby enemies fragger the traffic cop uh no sorry the man with the second biggest gun his parking tickets no wrong again his frag grenades will cause chaos and death if cooked for long enough and his lmg does nothing to ease the enemys pain except perhaps a quick death many soon find out why fragger is called what he is rhino now for the man with the biggest gun rhino is a monster of a man who can hold entire areas if paired with a medic such as aura with his minigun which doesnt run dry on ammo and instead can overheat quickly if used wrongly rhino is the merc with the most health and as such should not be taken lightlydidnt realise how much i had written up until now so tldr if you want ittldr dirty bomb is a crazy fun f2p fps which has an alright business model where you can pay to progress faster unlock characters quicker and it provides a decently balanced game for the most part where each character feels powerful and matches that are all objective focused feel tense right down to the last second also to mention one last thing there is a certain movement to the game where walljumping is possible which adds a layer or two to fighting thought it was worth a mentiongreat game hope it does well in the future edit changed phantoms description due to patch fixes"
Evolve,"first up my hours look lower than they are as i frequently have to use offline mode to play games so theres thatid estimate i have around 2535 hours as of writing but thats a rough guessnow ive never played any of the harvest moon games which i believe are what inspired stardew valley however i can say with certainty that i would have loved them stardew valley is a wonderful mix of relaxing and fastpaced gameplay and i know it may not seem like that at first glance the game at its core rEvolves around managing farmland in your little corner of the valley its actually quite a lot of space designing and planting crops filling barns and coops wth animals and keeping it all running day by day beside all this management gameplay there is alot an exploration element which involves fishing mining or foraging for things to eat cook or sell and deciding whether to farm or do these various side activities adds a layer of complexitity to the game wherein you must manage time and energy as both are limited choosing your activites day by day is one option however if you prefer a slower less pressured play style you can simply enjoy the game for what it is and do whatever activity you desire there is no consequence aside from perhaps lost profits and you will never be fully bankrupt thanks to foraging or the other activities stardew valley does have a sort of story to it in that you can try to rebuild the towns community center or take a darker path which consists of placing predefined items from the game and from all the activities into their respective bundles in the center this will take a lot of time and i wager i still have a long way to go yet the few bundles i have completed fully have given me very helpful bonuses such as shortcuts through the valley and opening entire new zones which have their own benefits all of this is taken into consideration each day when deciding what to do which makes day planning a very fun and interesting thing to do finally there is a social aspect to the game with the townsfolk allowing you to court and marry select members which is as you would expect a fairly egregious process however quite satisfying to watch the game also features festivals and events each season which are a tonne of fun in and of themselvesoverall i would highly recommend this game if it looks in any way interesting to you i cant believe what a work of art this is and i commend concernedape for his love and hard work"
Evolve,"thank you for this experiencespoilers may or may not be implied be warnedlife is strange is an unusual ride a blend of story and deeper meanings mixed in with some hints of the supernatural themes rEvolve around morality decision making what could have been who should come out on top or whether anyone should at all but most of all it makes you think about basic humanitarian needs and how similar we are in the long runor at least it did for me maxine is a quiet and introverted photographer whom has returned to her home town after five years away as such i can relate to her character in various ways you are presented opportunities to help others at risk to your own safety which is something i personally regret not being able to do in previous scenarios in my own lifeas such this conflicts with other characters whom may have been threatening the ones you most wished to assist which further reinforces a feeling of loss as they may not deserve your pity but nonetheless are also a person with a personality and dreams which you have helped to hinder or obfuscate in some way in order to help your preferred characterepisode one goes along a solid path and i will most definitely be purchasing the subsequent episodes as i believe they will make me think and cry as i have with this episodewhat a work of artim not going to go into detail about the graphics or sound but i believe they were beautiful in their own wayif you enjoy reading listening and absorbing a fantastic story patiently i recommend this to you"
Evolve,"recommending this not just because i loved it but it makes you thinkthe concepts and ideas put forth in this visual novel are fascinating touching on morality utopia equality and a mix of other categories the story is hard to grasp at first without prior knowledge but you do eventually slide into it and its a tough ride to be sure the artwork and presentation is very standard of a visual novel in that it looks gorgeous and sounds great and the characters text is very fluent and well edited you essentially follow the character winter around its extremely linear as with all visual novels and experience the story via text and choice making your choices can lead in various directions allowing you to see different outcomes make sure to save RIRE which reinforces the whole theme of the story which rEvolves around managing chaos on remote worldsi greatly enjoyed this experience and will definitely be buying the second episode when it releases so as to learn even more bloody beautiful"

Evolve,"enjoyed the hell out of the beta loved the game on release my mates and i pouring many hours into this game some free and paid dlc comes out which is fine as im keen for more maps however the dlc keeps coming and coming begin thinking overkill is going overboard with the dlc still waiting on things that were promised before the beta was released features that were fairly basic and should have been in the game i was content to just stop playing and leave it at that but then overkill brought out this microtransaction weapon skin heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t despite their insistence that microtransactions would never happenso now im here giving this a negative review its a shame really because the game was great at first but then they just got greedy and now were left with this before they implemented microtransactions i would have said at least they didnt get as greedy or as stupid as turtle rock studios did with their Evolve dlc but overkill went the step further and completely one upped them which is a pretty unimpressive featdamn you overkill you ruined something that was fun"
The_Community,"once i started to play this game i was hooked with game play and an art style that wont age this game will keep you intersted for a while The_Community in this game can be toxic some times but otherwise is quite friendly trading in this game is very intesting with an extremly large community for a fps game i would recomend everyone to play this game as it is free to play and free to uninstall"
Dota_2,"Dota_2 defense of the ancients 2 is one of the best mobas multiplayer online battle arena where the objective is to competitvely push lanes and destroy enemy towers to eventually reach their base first one to take down the enemys ancient final large building wins and one of the most popular second only to league of legendsit is very similar to RIRE although there is no surrender feature in normal games yet and if you play RIRE or most other mobas i can guarantee youll have a good time in Dota_2 provided you can get over the difficultythe difficulty in Dota_2 is much higher than other games of the same genre league can be quite easy but dota is a complete other world where if you dont do even the smallest split second thinking right it can cost an entire teamfight and then lead to defeat dont let this scare you though practising against bots will allow you to get ability and item combinations down patalthough if youve never played a moba before it may take a while to learn as wellknown Dota_2 player purge says it will take about 23 months before youd be considered ok or decent along side this difficulty in game is the players sometimes youll get really nice players that joke around a bit sometimes youll get nice competitive players sometimes youll get people who joke around the entire game to annoy their teambut sometimes youll get players who want nothing but perfection i myself at times may be one of these people and detriment their own team if the smallest thing isnt done correctly there is a reason behind this which is like ive meantioned before even the slightest wrongdoing tower diving for a kill aka suiciding but this is quite a large examplethe heroes not champions you get to play as are all given to you at the start rather than buying or unlocking them although this may seem like all the new players would get to play the best heroes from the start there isnt exactly a best hero heroes have many many downsides and weaknesses and if not played well can lead to some of those problems ive mentioned above once a hero is learnt to play well though it is possible to effectively dominate the enemy team when playing on pubs casual servers beware when going into ranked matches though most people in ranked will know how to play and what to do as it requires a fair amount of playing to unlock ranked i myself unlocked it in 120 games which was for me 240 hours of playing the gameoverall this is a great freetoplay game that is definitely worth getting its free after all and it isnt a small game unlike some f2p games that have next to no content or games that need to have most of the content bought to be able to use it and actually have fun in the game it isnt paytoplay in the slightest as the only thing money can buy is extra looks for heroes wards huds couriers and loading screens there are about 100 regular users and counting how about you join themid give this game a 9510 maybe even a 10 because of a hero that is afraid of treesrizzrack10 i love you timbersaw httpdota2gamepediacomtimbersaw hero referenced"

Dota_2,"i began playing Dota_2 at a time when i thought moba games were the weakest of the game genres i always thought it was weird to play a game like this and whenever i saw gameplay videos of Dota_2 i had no idea what the heck was going on it never occured to me though that this game would have baited me in for more hours of playtime when i first started dota there were some training missions i had to go through these explained the basics pretty well to me and eventually i thought i knew what i was doing also i also thought there wouldve been some sort of story mode due to the way the training was presented unfortunately there was none but i could see some potential for a storylike modealthough during my first public matchup i did feel like quiting because i really did have no idea what i was doing and my teammates were complaining about how bad i was to the other team thats right the other teamour enemies then they all began calling me a noob the amount of insults i received were terrible but eventually i had a few other friends play the game along with me and thats when things began to change thats when Dota_2 became something i actually loved to play because of friends and because my friends and i got better it came to a point when we started to insult the enemy team whenever we trashed them everytime we do that it would just end up with us having fun regardless of us winning or not thats what Dota_2 is for me having a good time with friends and having funi then tried RIRE and i came to the conclusionDota_2 RIRE since this game is free to play i highly recommend it its free so i say why not its best played with people you know after all it is a team based game there are more things to talk about in dota but if you want to know what they are play the game experience it"

Team_Fortress_2,"i dont really care enough to write reviews but this game i found genuinely dissapointing i saw it on sale for about 16 the day before its release i remember seing the e3 presentation of the game and thought hey seems like it could be a nice mystery game with decent decision making that would effect the outcome along with some rather pleasent to listen to voice acting so i had an interest in this title but did it fare to my expectations nope heres whynow i am going to avoid spoilers because i respect that some will want to give this a shot themselves but i strongly recommend waiting for a sale like 500 sale im going to start off with the pros because despite my overall disappointed there are some commendable attributesprosvoice acting this is definitly the golden prize of the game interactions between henry rich sommer and delilah cissy jones are engaging and rather entertaining it definilty does a good job and genuinely making you feel involved in the characters relationshipsoundtrack the ambient acoustic guitar throughout the game never got tedious and kept me enthralled and quite relaxed art style a rather pretty lookng game i definilty sense heavy inspiration of Team_Fortress_2 especially in player model a modded asset from Team_Fortress_2 environment is pretty to look at but ultimately feels kind of lifelesstory acts one and two the sense of mystery surrounding the game specifically in the first two acts definilty made a rather intense ontheegde of your seat impact it was what drove me to keep playing till the end but this is where i get into the consconsnot enough depth i thoroughly enjoyed the first 40 minutes of playing i initially felt the game couldve had a lot to offer in terms of exploration i mean look at the map when you first get into the lookout it seams plentiful like thered be a lot to find and discover but unfortunately theres northing really to keep from following the rather linear pathway to keep the story rolling i didnt get the flashlight till near the end of the game and i pretty much didnt even need it lifeless when you start off and come across an elk and then a tree scratched to heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit by a grizzly i thought huh maybe therell be an encounter with a grizzly nope asside from the grantotal 3 npcs to come across there is very little wildlife present in these woods even though the game warns of these encounters they never occure everlength having finished the game in only 3 hours i finally understand angry joes contempt for short heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit titles ive often avoided them because they arent worth the asking price i honesltly hoped this wouldve been a bit longer 8 9 hours atleast illusion of choice one thing the game did interestingly was the choices of dialogue between henry and delilah but ultimiately this was meaningless and has little impact on endgame even the text based intro makes no difference whatsoever except for a naked sketch of you depending on how you choose pose thats itending sucked a game presented like this at least couldve had multiple endings theres only two and theyre both exactly the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing same all in all i give this game a 4 out of 10 its not really worth 20 if on sale for like 500 and you enjoy dialogue heavy games then maybe give it a shot but for the most part its pretty meh"

Csgo,"review on portuguese and englishanalise em portugues e inglesreview on englishanalise em inglessummary insurgency is a fps firstperson shooter game with tactical elements that tend to realism but can be configured to become arcade this depending on the server even the game not having a campaign to get more interesting its exclusively focused to the cooperative against aicontrolled bots and to the multiplayer against real enemiesentering the game the player can choose to join the insurgents team or to the security team both have their own classes weapons and customizations but even so the game can keep very well balanced during the matchcurrently insurgency has 7 different game modes in the multiplayer which the maximum server capacity is 32 players about the cooperative match the game has 5 different modes and the maximum server capacity is 8 playersgraphics as for the graphics we can say that is impressive to see how developers worked to optimize them to the maximum even with many elements present during a match the game doesnt need a very good pc to run the graphics stand out for being well modeled and with a excellent finish the details of the scenarios and weapons also impresses but it is impossible to compare them to new generation of games i think the graphics are similar to Csgo there are some mods at steam workshop that can slightly improve the graphics of the gamesounds audios another extremely positive point of insurgency is the quality of the sounds of weapons environments and explosions they can make you get fully into the game because it seems that you are in a real war and also you can download some mods in steam workshop that will improve the effect and the experience letting the game more real or funny ping fps the game has a really good rendering which makes it possible to run even on less powerful computers if you can run Csgo on low graphics at 60 fps probably can play insurgency without any problem and servers respond very well even with 200 ping you can play without perceive any difference or interference while the gameplaygameplay the gameplay of insurgency is a bit different because it tends to the realism so it becomes a bit more complicated than other fps games we are used to always being very fluid and responding well to the requested commands if you are new to fps games maybe you will pass a bit of difficulty cause you dont have a quick answer against enemies or even an advanced coverage notion yet to the veterans on fps games can be sure that insurgency will make you become better at basically every other fps you play or have playedthe physics in the game is a little weak it tries to hide some mistakes but it doesnt work so much for example the bodies dont react too well to bulletsi didnt find any individual cheating or doing some bugdevelopers assets and attentive the insurgency supportdevelopment team is an example always trying to help you with any questions or problems you have in the game unlike many other games the developersupport community of insurgency tries to maintain a intense contact with the public as an example they play matches with us you can contact them through steam if you need something which makes the service be much faster and easiercommunity in the sense of insurgency players community i can not analyze in relation to asian oceania or africa servers but the american all the america not only usa and europe community are very warm and friendly also very funny allahu akbar at every match that i played i didnt find any rager or any that harm your gameplay such as abusing the voice chat abusing the chat or kill his own team with intent the players community created and are creating a lot of mods to improve or vary your gameplay some mods are very hilarious also the artworks and screenshots created from players are very coolanalise em portuguesreview on portugueseresumo insurgency e um jogo fps firstperson shooter tatico com elementos que tendem para o realismo porem podem ser configurados para deixalo bem arcade isso dependendo do servidor mesmo com o jogo nao tendo uma campanha para ficar mais interessante a sua proposta e exclusivamente focada para o cooperativo contra bots controlados por ia e para o multiplayer contra inimigos reais ao entrar na partida o jogador podera escolher entre se unir ao time de insurgentes ou ao time de seguranca ambos possuem suas proprias classes armas e customizacoes mas mesmo assim o jogo consegue manter um balanceamento muito bom durante a partidagraficos em relacao aos graficos e possivel afirmar que e impressionante ver como os desenvolvedores trabalharam para otimizalos ao maximo mesmo com muitos elementos presentes durante uma partida isso nao o torna pesado de maneira alguma se destacam por serem bem modelados e com um acabamento excelente o detalhamento dos cenarios e das armas tambem impressionasonsaudios outro extremo ponto positivo de insurgency e a quantidade de riqueza e qualidade dos sons das armas ambientes e explosoes e possivel voce se imergir totalmente ao jogo por conta destes que o fazem parecer que realmente esta em uma guerra no workshop tambem e possivel voce alterar alguns sons de armas explosoes e outros efeitos para deixalo ainda mais realpingfps o jogo possui uma renderizacao muita boa a qual o faz ser possivel de rodar mesmo em computadores menos potentes se voce consegue rodar Csgo com graficos baixos a 60 fps provavelmente conseguira jogar insurgency sem nenhum problema e os servidores respondem muito bem ate 200 de ping e possivel voce jogar sem nem mesmo perceber diferenca ou interferencia durante sua gameplayjogabilidade a jogabilidade do insurgency e um pouco diferenciada e por conta de o jogo tender mais para o realismo ela se torna um pouco mais complicada do que outros jogos de fps que estamos acostumados sempre sendo muito fluida e respondendo bem aos comandos solicitados caso voce seja iniciante em jogos do genero pode ser que passe dificuldade para conseguir ter uma resposta rapida contra os inimigos ou mesmo uma nocao de cobertura avancada aos mais veteranos em jogos fps posso ter certeza que insurgency fara com que voce se torne melhor em basicamente todos os outros fps que voce joga ou ja jogou por conta da estrategia e velocidade de reacao que e necessaria durante a partidanao consegui encontrar nenhum individuo trapaceando seja com programas maliciosos ou com bugs no proprio jogodesenvolvedores ativos e atentos a equipe de desenvolvimento do insurgency e um exemplo sempre buscam lhe ajudar com qualquer duvida ou problema que voce tenha no jogo ao contrario de muitos outros jogos a comunidade desenvolvedora de insurgency tenta manter um contato forte com o publico jogando ate mesmo partidas juntos com outros jogadores e possivel contatalos atraves da steam caso necessite de algo o que faz o atendimento ser muito mais rapido e facilcomunidade no sentido da comunidade de jogadores do insurgency eu nao posso analisar em relacao a servidores asiaticos da oceania ou africanos porem a comunide americana toda a america nao so eua e europeia e muito amigavel e receptiva alem de muito engracada allahu akbar em nenhuma partida que joguei consegui testemunhar atos que prejudiquem o gameplay de outros como abusar do canal de voz canal de texto ou matar a propria equipe com intencao o jogo permite que a comunidade poste mods na workshop para diversificar e deixar o jogo com maior estilo do jogador assim como preferir"

Well_There,"as one of the players during its time as a subscription model this was a enjoyable experience in terms of graphical fidelity this game has a beautiful backdrop and lighting effects and artstyle of somewhat cartoonishlook gives the models of both characters and monsters some justice and fits Well_There are 4 races and nine classes to choose from and each does have an interesting style for each one but some classes are locked for others and there is varying difficulty per class lore and narrative gameplay allows the player to actually meet many of the characters from the stories like strider gimli thorin oakenshield and gandalf the grey before their demise or journey in middleearth in the starting areas the loading screens also give some additional lore to what happens as players transition between townsi also love the music making system from lutes to harpsin terms of gameplay however this game is a hotkey setup and does suffer from some odd pauses in combat"

Csgo,"counter strike a game made far long ago and escalating so much into quite the achievement as much as i wish to appraise this game it can not deserve a recommendation by me the fact that you are so unforgivingly banned from matchmaking is pointless to say the least i was disconnected due to internet hiccups for exactly 3 minutes and 24 seconds yes i timed it and it gives me a 7 day ban the thing that makes this so frustrating is that it was the first match back after another 7 day ban for similar issues the fact that they do not forgive the fact that you may live in a woodland area where power can go out every now and again or the fact that steam can act buggy sometimes gets it a 310 from this cs veteran21515 edit i recieved yet another ban from matchmaking this times issue was the following i kicked too many teammates let me begin by reiterating that i had just finally gotten back after 2 weeks of no playtime due to internet issues and in this first game a teammate began to throw the match ie shooting teammates or shooting in the air around enemies yes someone not me called a vote to kick him and i agreed because hes throwing the match but appearantly in 2 weeks of no matchmaking play one vote to kick got me another 7 day ban this is a continued portrayal to Csgos broken economy and has dropped my rating to 010 how can a game be rated greatly when it prevents all access to competetive players even when theres a fallacy involved31315 edit another ban to add to this list this time its from being kicked too many times giving me another 7 day and heres how it happened the game was a comp office the ct was whooping our asses so far yet with me being second top on our team three of the players who were in a team decided to kick me because they can not win this further proves my thesis that Csgo is still broken majorly when it comes to matchmaking bans the utter fact that this game has the audasity phonics ftw to allow things like this to keep happening with no way of appealing to anyone about getting it lifted"

Garrys_Mod,"Garrys_Mod is a game to play when your feeling sad or down its really nice to play it when you have valve games installed its nice to pose things and make things like a flying car a giant roller coaster just about anything you can think you can take screenshots to show off your skills or put something on the workshop to share with other people its also fun to play the multiplayer when your tired of singleplayer in multiplayer you can play with friends play the gamemodes that people make or just mess around in the spawn menu you can also make really funny poses and spawn in really silly stuff installing addons in the workshop is really nice if your making very professinal scenes or poses Garrys_Mod also has a really fun community with some very intresting achivements if you would like to earn themremember your imagination is the limit"
Portal,"this Portal 2 mod has got to be one of the greatest things to exist on steamit had the smooth unknown atmosphere which made it seem like you dont know what will happen to you or the environment around you the detail put into this was just amazingPortal stories mel had also kept the challenging atmosphere from Portal 2 making you think harder and also making you think twice before you solve a test chamber the soundtrack was also brilliant and amazing and fits in perfectly with the style of the testthe achivements are a reason why you got ta keep coming back to this i got ta say some of the achivements are challenging and worth it toovirgil was a very funny sidekick to have around he was pretty genius but at the same time pretty stupid and hilarious aegis was a very cool villan to have but however his overall design in the boss battle didnt look very goodif i had to recommend this i definitly would do so its really good and worth waiting for the hours to pass so it can downloadpotatos citranium"

Dont_Starve,"the standard Dont_Starve experience wrapped up with a well balanced multiplayersome things have changed to rebalance the multiplayer and as such you will be surprised and disappointed with a few things it isnt as bad as you may immediately think as it is done to keep the feeling of dread that standard single player Dont_Starve was excellent at projecting more players easier as you all will be competing for resources whether youre playing competitively or notthe multiplayer is done very nicely as an australian who has been playing with americans these connections are known to be very laggy i was still able to function survive effectively and surpass my comrades there were those moments we all fear from long distance connections but they were few and far betweenbeing completely honest im very impressed it isnt easy to make a single player game into a fully functioning multiplayer version of itself ds was a 910 game for what it was and its execution dst makes it a 1010 because of how well it has translated the single player feel into a cooperative or competitive multiplayer"

Tf2,"when i first played this game it was very easy to get used to with quick action from Tf2 but as you get more health and the weapons are not as powerful you require more stratigic moves as in dota 2 or even RIRE a great combination i recomended this game to many of my friends and we play it all the time great game1010"

Besiege,"i would never usually buy a game in early access after the complete failure in my opinion of dayz standanlone which still doesnt have choppers but after looking at gameplay of this i thought i would give it a try Besiege has a fantastic engine which feels so smooth running at 60fps i have yet to find any game changing bugs and the only thing early access about it is the lack of content the way it should be i would highly recoment this game to people to try out and at this cheap price there is no point in pirating it"
The_Community,"great game tho i wish things where explained more through the game with out having to go to outside resources for help but over all 810 keep up the good work since the game has been released i find myself comming back new features are being implemented monthly The_Community is pretty decent and the mods for the game just keep adding to the game its a great little game well worth the price and also deffinetly a must have if u can pick it up on sale"

The_Community,"this gameis probably one of the best early access games you can get on all of steam right nowbeautifully optimized looks great with unity5 worth the 20 mcdees family mealheres one such fun experience i had which had me and my mate laughing for half an hour straight pros cons at the line we were getting constantly raided on a modded aint nobody got time fo that vanilla stuff server we made a large town with the admins of the server and named it gastown it was probably the best settlement i ever built by far fair distance away from the beach slap dab in the middle of the desert landscape there are three in total snowice which wards off freshies and great for nighttime stalkin stalkers gon na stalk forestgrasslandshighlands for all the firsttimers who enjoy being in the presence of mutha nature and theres the desert desolate wasteland lots of quarry and pumpjack locations perfect for the marauders of the server and we had it all armoured tier 5 max protection up since we had more high quality metal than we knew what to do with we slowly invited people into our settlement of pumpjacks and mining quarries we slowly began to become the biggest band on the serverlong story short we got raided by ddosing hackers that kicked off everyone on the server including admins and flyhacked into our wellfortified complex then ending the kickwave and letting us spawn back into our bases to find that they were all c4d thats one of the many struggles of rust dem hackers eac seemingly does jacksht against these hackers vac just likes to create problems on all other games that dont use source but this is rust those who played the original alpha would have known that hackers were rampant in that thus one location on the old map dubbed hacker valley mainly because only hackers were able to get there in the first place like seriously who didnt hack back thenjokes aside we were kinda fed up about the whole ordeal so we took it upon ourselves and decided to go mess around with ladders and power pylons the big ones we ended up trying to spodermin up and trying to stand on it which we so hilariously failed hardcore but then we discovered we could put signs up on the pylons making a platform what was even better was that we could place furnaces n chests n sht up on these signplatforms we pretty much had the most heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ist base on the server hell even the owner decided to come base up with uswe always had plenty of freshspawns nudemans to harvest for food since they always tried to come up and raid us with rocks and spears yet we still held our ground with just crossbows and beancan gurrnades best moment of rust so farstorytime aside lets see the pros and cons of rust pros well built engine uses unity5 uses it well too plenty of different experiences each server you never will know what may happen on the next server you join lotsa gunz rust has plenty of guns to fit everybodys playstyle like going as the sniopah get a bolty like it upcloseandpersonal grab a shotgun or custom smg pathfinder grab a thompsonr250 rustedp250 and slap on a suppressor lightpacker grab the r250 and knock in some incendiary or explosive ammo you wont regret it wabbit sesunhunter grab a shotgun and load some slugs youll have plenty of newman carcasses to feed you for a whileas you see these are just some of my preset kits but ofcourse you can go ahead and go full pirate with the ak dress in red and go raiding make some of your own combinations weekly devblogs on whats going on facepunch does an excellent job of keeping The_Community uptodate on what theyre doing every friday of each week and we cant forget their trello trellocom page where they post their conecepts on where to go for rust and its great to say that the concept art they do is quite nicelooking too especially the trainyard radtown concept lookin foward to it guys every secondweek updates they do an amazing job of keeping to their update schedule unlike most other ea devs fun theres alot of fun to be had in this game like me and my mate how we discovered the spodermin pylons all by happy mistakesnow comes the cons hackers ofc this was going to be one issue but eac and vac are seemingly unable to deal with the hackers that run rampant on some servers theres always going to be someone who is able to crack the security there is always a way in admin abuse another big issue i forgot to mention theres some servers that have 16yo teens who think they can tell people what to do on the server and kick whoever they want just because their iceberg base got raided you will actually be suprised at the lengths people go to heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off an admin it is very entertaining p sometimes gameruining updates i have only encountered one of these bugs during a server restart where the world would not save and wipe the map of all bases but this has been since resolved a few months ago would i recommend this postapoccalyptic manhunt with explosives i fuk yes i would 1010 ign 88 while i finger my prostate"

The_Community,"what can i say counter strike has always been an excellent shooter and cs go is arguably the pinnacle of the series the addition of ranked competitive matches are essential to the experience in cs go with other modes being generally less impressive than straight forward public servers seen in previous titles cheating is more prevalent than ever within ranked matches leading to many disappointing experiences especially within the higher ranked matchesthe monetisation of skins is purely optional and while a total waste of money it is reasonably unobtrusive if that is not something you are into the addition of wagering on professional matches in the game probably warrants an ethical discussion especially for younger playersthe dlc packs are generally not worth a purchase as they are now no longer required to play the maps and only offer additional achievements and vanity items having said that the quality of these dlc maps overall can be a mixed bag but regular content updates are always great to seei probably wouldnt suggest this title to younger players as the monetisation options can not be disabled The_Community is generally quite abusive and the amount of cheaters may lead to more frustration than fun for committed but less mature playershaving said that this is probably one of the best competitive first person shooters ever made there are quite literally hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay here due to the depth offered in both skill and strategy unfortunately much like in many other competitive online games it is The_Community that lets the game down the most with rampant cheating and generally unpleasant people being never too hard to run intoi would recommend this game to any shooter fan but its certainly not for the faint hearted expect to get seriously beat up on if you are coming in cold"
The_Community,"despite the low server population and steep learning curve this is one of the most underrated and rewardingly deep first person shooters ever made it has a genuinely unique premise excellent graphics is well optimised and stable and boasts an impressive depth of both skill and strategy to the gameplay if not for the dwindling population and high likleyhood of getting utterly detroyed by veteran players i would totally recommend that every fps fan play thisThe_Community is somewhere between welcoming and scornful and while newbies may be welcome in some corners this is a game where you should expect to get totally and utterly destroyed by series veteransthis will forever be one of the most underated games ever made"

Nether,"reviewing each episode individually then the game as a holespoilers ahead plus the fact that this review will be influenced by the choices i madeseason 1episode 1 810one was definitely my favourite episode with the introducement to the main characters jesse axel olivia and lucas this sets off as the three friends attempting to build a fireworks stand at a builders tournament and a introduction to the order of the stone in which the victor gets to meet gabriel the warrior one of the members of the order after all of this crap happens you lose your pig and got ta find him meeting petra the female feminist empowering character you and her out to sell a wither skull she has found to the main antagonist ivory or as i call him the shady guy after the interview with gabriel ivory builds a wither in which the flask inorder to control is stolen from your good buddy axel and the witherstorm gones ape st and starts consuming endercon completey after a chain of events in which you can save petra or galbriel you enter the Nether after this you find yourself at the orders temple you have to finish puzzles in order to use the amulet galbriel gave you oh ye he gives you this magical amulet to track the order you have to choose to go with olivia to find ellegard or with axel to find magnus a great fun episodeepisode 2 610in this episode you have to choices i went with olivia so i will tell the story of ellegard you find her in her city redstonia in which you have to do some redstone crap and get into her thinking block there you must help her build a command block before the witherstorm comes and flips st up yet again after you return you find galbriel just chillin in the temple with lucas also axel went to find the other dude after this you find the tracker to my boy soren and attempt to track his footsteps at his temple the two order members you picked up get hella mad at each other and leave after you run into ivory in which you find out he was a former order member you engage him in battle until he uses some elixir and runs away trapping you and your buddies in a library this was an ok episode probs oh though i still reckon it was the worst out of the fourepisode 3 7510in this episode you attempt to find soren yet again losing the amulet while diging out of the temple finding a mob grinder leads you to the end in there you find a whole wool world sorens built and a bunch of enderman he is attempting to make them build after putting the enderman suit on you try to find him after finding him he punches you and takes you inside his house there the enderman siege it and you and your buddies must escape after coming back to surface you make the super tnt crap and magnus and ellegard are back together fighting the witherstorm there you build the bomb and blow the thing up leading to the death of either ellegard or magnus getting surviors you see that the command block is not damaged and it starts sucking everything up again yet this time there is 3 of them finding either petra or galbriel you run away into the next episode this was a good episode exploring some unique themes of the power of being alone for a long period of timeepisode 4 810in this episode you run away from the witherstorm once again and retreat to a crib in the mountains there you find out that petra has forgotten everything and doesnt remember you in which you try to figure out stuff about the witherstorm ivory comes along and soren gets hell mad that the bomb didnt work but ivory figures out to destroy it using a enchanted sword in which you and some of your buddies have to use the horses to go the far lands when finally getting there you complete this maze in which it leads you to ivorys lab there you find out the truth of the order of the stone and craft the weapon strong enough to destroy the command block in the witherstorm after leaving you finally engage the witherstorm in combat and destroy the command block but not without pay your poor pig reuben dies after galbriel reveals you and your friends are the new order of the stone in the end you can tell to reveal the truth about the order or let the people dream this episode was sick finally ending the witherstorm and knowing that nobodies can truly become legendaryoverall minecraft storymode is really fun game with unique character creation semipredicatable and for a so called kids game actually pretty dark with touching moments and moments of sorrow and lack of salvation though the game was pretty quick only took me 7 hours to finish its still a really funny sick game defiantly worth buying 7510 lets say 14 is season 1 regardless as it all links togetherseason 2 will review when all episodes come out"

The_Community,"stardew valley is a heartwarming game you may pass this up in your queue as another boring indie game with pixelart graphics but if you look closer youll find a beautiful game masterfully created by a single person with great graphics an intriguing plot and a real sense of community if youre anything like me youll get lost within the game within your first hour many draw comparisons with harvest moon and i definitely agree but as many see it as a reimagining i see it as a spiritual successor building upon the farming and marriage aspects of the game and adding things like events community fishing mining combat foraging and The_Community centrethe few things that bring the game down are its audio bugs very few gamepad support using a keyboard and mouse is much better shallow combat scheme could be built upon and pixel sizings not matching sometimes which never fails to look like a beautiful meadow with dead cows in it by this i mean when watching tv and several inventory items but all these are tiny nitpicks compared to the full gamei would definitely reccomend stardew valley in fact its my independent game of the year so far and one of my favourite games of all time and its made by one personalso its a pretty cool game to 100 achievements are fair and not too timeconsuming and its an overall fun game and The_Community centre thing is one of the best things to 100 this year in my opinionfinal rating 9110"

The_Community,"this game had plenty of potential when i bought it in early acess over a year ago the company is known for creating very substandard games the monstrosoty starforge was a very big cash grab for their audience never the less we gave them a chance after a year of development the game is still extremley similiar with barely anything added the game is ruined by bugs and hackers and the developers dont listen to The_Community i will never purchase anyother codehatch game again ive put many hours into this game and i cant believe ive wasted so much time on such tripe if you want to waste time in anger then go ahead and play it"

The_Community,"dayz standalone after roughly playing this game for 20 hours i have enjoyed it so far although my review is going to be washed down by all the negetives i just want get my review out there dayz standalone has been in early access for about 3 years and some people just dont read the note displayed on the dayz standalone steam page warning this game is early access alpha please do not purchase it unless you want to actively support development of the game and are prepared to handle with serious issues and possible interruptions of game as a short answer i would say dont buy the game until its fully out or in beta unless you want to face countless glitches such as zombies running trough walls and triple hitting in dayz zombies are the least of your worries you can play as a legendery hero or a bandit i have been held as hostage 3 times already you can also play a role playing version of dayz i havent touched dayzrp but you can play it here httpwwdayzrpcom prosrealistic unlike some other zombiesurvival gamesreally big map that takes alot of your time and does not keep you boardbalanced weaponsthats really it i cant remember anything else 3 cons really hard to meet new people as they might kill you or hold you hostagereally hard to find ammunition because all millitary basespolice stations are lootedeverywhere is looted if you play on a server with heaps of people conclusion anyone who says dayz standalone is dead or that the developers have taken the money and ran or that The_Community is dead quite frankly is full of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit the game is very much alive and so much better than it was when it started even though dayz sa has been slow off the start compared to other survivalist games h1z1 rust ark unturned miscreated etc i strongly believe it will come out on top as the best survivalist game when it is finished no other survival game has this much attention to detail and realism as dayz no other survival game has the kind of studio resources and money that bohemia has to put out a strong title no other survival game has mastered the hardcore aspect of survival and struggle better than dayz almost every other survival game was rushed out on a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit unreal engine in an effort to reap money off the survivalist scene and try to outbeat bohemia to the punch on features and gameplay games like rust and h1z1 fail to hit the bullseye on what a survival game should be dayz standalone does this right and does it good i would definitely recommend this game now as its about to surpass the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit outta all other games on the market go out there and start surviving but be warned of the glitches thanks for reading i also might make a fps boost guide for dayz edit i made a dayz fps boost guide httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid675608086"

Evolve,"innovation is almost always a good thing especially in the relatively saturated and homogeneous survival genre procedurally generated postapocalyptic worlds need wood get wood build blockbased houses form groups with other human players to survive these are elements that are as overused as the faded tighty whities that i continue to wear to date and who can forget the zombiesits always another bloody ugly zombieand that is why the long dark feels like a drop of pristine water on a wretched pair of lips its artstyle is bold and deliciously refreshing in a game that is intended to simulate survival in the harsh conditions of the northern canadian wilderness its roguelike elements such as permanent death and a finite amount of loot in the world shifts the players focus from spending hours upon hours developing a character and his or her humble abode to spending hours upon hours replaying just to beat a previous personal best in terms of the number of ingame days survived and instead of surviving against zombies players in the long dark are tasked to survive against mother nature which manifests in the form of biting windchills and harrowing blizzards as well as the wolf denizens that perpetually roam the snowy terrains the sound design of the long dark is also extremely well done everything from the crunch of your soles on snow to the groaning and creaking of wooden floorboards as you scavenge a log cabin for muchneeded supplies to the resounding bellow of your hunting rifle as you fire it at a menacing wolf sounds engaging immersive and realisticyes realism is the long darks home address being caught outside while there is a windchill can be devastating but hiding behind rocks sitting in the path of the direction of the wind can provide temporary relief to slow down the onset of freezing the games hunger system is also caloric based foods that you may loot from the environment have calories similar to their reallife counterparts albeit scaled up slightly since all activities including sleeping and standing still burns calories in order to survive your character has to consume a certain amount of calories each day in addition he or she also has to drink at least 22litres of water a day to prevent being dehydrated on the other hand innovation can be a twofaced heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit if taken too far it can detract immensely from a games production values and amount to a gigantic waste of a developers time reinventing a triedandtested wheel or removing core gameplay elements of a particular genre for no apparent logical or worthwhile purpose are typical examples of taking innovation one step too far as much as the long dark is a unique game that stands well apart from the rest in the survival genre hinterland studio has adopted a couple of gameplay design choices that are difficult to comprehend and for lack of a better word paradoxicalthe biggest culprit lies in the long darks surprising lack of player interaction with the environment besides interacting with the games various containers that exist in the form of drawers lockers cupboards stoves starting a fire and the occasional shooting of a wolf or deer there is little else that the player can do to change or manipulate the environment necessary activities such as the cooking of food harvesting of meat from an animals carcass or the boiling of snow to make potable water are reduced to dull and meaningless loading bars that signal the progression of an activity there is no farming there is no fortifying of a prefabricated house to better ward off the cold or wolves i could think of a hundred more things that a player as a survivor in an icy wilderness would be expected to do to survive better sadly players in the long dark are robbed of those options because the game limits the ways in which they can interact meaningfully with their environment why this should be so in a survival game is bewildering it metamorphoses an otherwise openworld survival game one that should be a suitable platform for the inception of personal survival stories whether heroic or tragic into a linear game of repetitive choicesthis is not to say that the long dark is bereft of playermade choices in spite of the games limited playerenvironment interactivity players still have a good amount of decisions to make that dictates how well or how long they will survive in the long dark for example constantly traveling in the open when there is a strong windchill will result in your character burning more calories as he or she freezes thus requiring you to expend more of your limited food supply each day restoring those lost calories similarly being greedy and attempting to carry all of the loot scavenged from your most recent exploration trip will also result in more calories burnt as your character shoulders the heavier load making a second trip on another day to carry the remaining supplies back to your stronghold may be a better strategy finding a way to make the most out of your limited supplies is an obsession that will occupy players especially the compulsive ones for many hours on endnonetheless the negative effects on the games longevity as a result of its decision to eschew player interactivity in favor of simplicity and ease of uptake are manifest despite the long dark currently sporting 3 different maps for players to explore in sandbox mode the relative constrained size of each map and the finite number of prefabs for players to loot means that each map can support at most 45 hours of proper gameplay beyond that the game starts to dEvolve into a tiresome cycle of hunting for deer or wolf foraging for wood cooking meat and boiling water to sustain your characters physical needs and resting in bed there is nothing else to do you can not build you can not farm all there is left to do is to wait for the inevitable end a most unfitting conclusion to a game with so much potentialat its current sale price of usd199 on steam the long dark is barely worth a buy my suggestion is to wait for a sale before spending some of your hardearned money on this game the long dark will most certainly become a better game with time on the other hand you are also unlikely to regret if you choose to invest in this game now it is one of the most polished and interesting earlyaccess survival game that is currently available on the market and if you enjoy a roguelike survival game that challenges you to do better in each successive game that you initiate the long dark is capable of providing an almost endless number of hours of enjoyment i am therefore giving the long dark the thumbs up"
The_Community,"i personally love this game its so fun and intense every match does feel like im in a horror film and i fckin love ityes there are bugs with matchmaking there are some things that still need to be ironed out but at its core it works and its fun this is a very great start and the developers are clearly driven to keep updating and improving the game theyre very involved with The_Community and they have weekly twitch streams which i highly reccomend checking out i personally would urge anyone to buy it i get if its not everyones cup of tea but its a fun fastpaced game"

Team_Fortress_2,"ive been waiting to have at least a month of playtime to write a review but since day one you have pretty much everything you could expect from a game of this genre topped im not a veteran of this kind of game by any means only played diablo 1 and not even a fan with this game its a complete different story everything that went wrong with diablo 1 that i can call out myself and diablo 2 3 by others as its a constant comparison with the now exking of the genre is made right in path of exile its even considered by some its rightful successor what was expected from the latest diablo title and just came out short as Team_Fortress_2 draws people from many likings into a firstperson shooter poe has players who are not even that into rpgs but theres something that lures them in the lore the scenery the loot system something aside from the latency drawback its a game that has much to give to the hardcore players as to the casual ones its made by an indie company that actively hears their player base and deploys frequent content updates and fixes still not enough reasons to try it out its free to play damn it"

Dota_2,"as incredibly popular as it is the game mechanics seem to be very much rendered to appeal to those already experts in the genre these finite and interesting mechanics seem to tease new players of low skill level another detterent for new players is the immediate unlock of all heroes this means that in order to find ones favorite hero players have to play through dozens of matches with new strategies and skills as a preference i would reccomend league of legends over Dota_2 for players new to the moba genre simply because of its more accessible interface and more newb friendly system"

Super_Meat_Boy,"from the creators of Super_Meat_Boy the binding of isaac is one of the most interesting and unique indie games on the market every play through is a blast and you will never have the same run twice as there are randomly generated rooms and floors to explore however in some aspects the games enjoyment is withered and incredibly frustrating within the first 1020 hours of gameplay and as a result you will die alotone of the finest elements that refine the game is its randomly generated level this gives the player loads of replayability and intrigue in what might happen next time i play with these randomly generated levels the designers also placed over 20 bosses that get more and more challenging as you progress and strategies may need to be employed to bring them down but it doesnt stop there there are close to 100 items that you can collect which alters the game mechanics and even your characters appearance and thats not even including dlc with every game there are the negatives and we must discuss them so whats wrong with this game well the first 1020 hours will kick you in the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit you will die many many times and if you dont learn from these mistakes and adapt to an enemies fighting capability you will keep getting your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kicked also be prepared to open up a wiki because when you pickup an item for the first time there is no telling what it will initially do however if you can manage to have the patience to get over that first 1020 hour hurdle then the game will be a blasttoo long didnt read let me summarise positives randomly generated levels no two runs will be the same tons of unique bosses items and enemies also mini bosses comedic tone and references throughout game negativesalmost sadistic first 1020 hoursno item descriptions blandly tells you item functions wtfalmost unplayable without consulting the wikithis game is undoughtably fun dont let those negatives throw you off this game deserves to be played i payed 10 for this game and ive probably milked about 5 times its value out of it for 5 on steam 3 dlc that you should only buy once youve completed the game several times this game is a bargain and deserves your utmost attention910"
Tf2,"this game is just great it has the one thing most fps games lack that one thing is community made game modesmaps ect the fact you can get the game fans and followers to create items to be put in the game is amazing it also brings a lot of diversity to Tf2 and i love playing something new everyday810"
The_Community,"this game is a very fun game although very untidy it is a ton of fun and a barrel of laughs there is a warning upon startup of the game that tells you that the game is a work in progress so you can not really complain about all the bugs and problems it has but regardless of its errors that will tick you off sometimes it is still really really fun sometimes challenging sometimes easy it really depends on the server the time you play and where you spawn the only thing that really grinds my gears is The_Community most people will just shoot you before they ask you your name so unfortunately its shoot first or die sometimes you get the good person that is willing to help you out like myself but most people are pretty merciless also some bambis fresh spawns will pose to be of good heart but the minute you put a weapon in their hands you better be ready to quickly draw your weapon so that is the only big big problem that might not able to be fixed but i definitely do recommend this game"
Csgo,"walking down a beach and seeing a light house walking up to it and looking up to see the massive scale of this light house scale thats what makes this game so enjoyable is the scale as i found this rock pool and i look up and see the georgeous blue sky with these rocks around it just looks so dam good now beware this is a walking sim but that doesnt make it bad as when i get home i like to relax so its nice to come home to a plesant view and yes i am using vr but it isnt the htc vive or the oculus rift insted it is my samsung galaxy s7 and the viewmaster vr getting samsung gear vr i am also using an app call trinus vr now i can hapily say that this game is great to calm down and its only 099c so you know sell a Csgo skin or a steam card to get this game"

Metro_2033,"a very short summaryMetro_2033 is a postapocalytpic firstpersonshooter videogame based on the novel written by dmity glukhovsky the story follows a young man named artyom as he travels through the dark and dangerous tunnels of the moscow metro while fighting for his life against mutants and banditswhether it is the darkness of the tight tunnels or the open space of the destroyed surface above i simply love the atmosphere i mean its similar to every other postapocalyptic game that ive played but this one just seems different somehow plus tiny features such as cracks on the gas mask and the heavy breathing of the protagonist makes it even better in my opinion the only downsides of the videogame is the voiceacting im assuming that they were trying to steer away from the stereotypical russian accent or its just me and my knowledge of russian accents but lets just ignore that the framerate isnt the best either there are times when it would dramatically drop then randomly rise again i dont know about everyone else but then again maybe its just meall in all i think its an excellent game and to conclude this short review i give it a 455"

Men_Of_War,"this is my previous review when i hated the game you can read it but my new review is after the belowi thought it was an extremely fun game i loved the dday mission in campaign and even without the expansions it is an excellent gameuntil i went on the game one time and found that all units and bases were invisible i tried everything and even looked solutions up on youtube but to no avail sadly this game was a waste of my money and it is now unplayable because the enemies are invisible and it just ruins the once amazing company of heroes i am now sort of hesitating to buy coh 2 becuase it could happen with that game too and coh 2 is 50 so sadly this game was a waste of time and money and unless it gets fixed i wont and cant play the game again but to wrap up on a good note i had plenty about 4 matches of good times and it is an older game so i cant expect too much cya and hope the the gods it gets fixed editso i reinstalled the game after deleting it and i happily found out that it didnt turn my men invisible i replayed the 1st campaign 1st level but on the second level all my men and enemy men were in tpose with their guns sticking out of there chests and to make it worst everythng but the ground was black not bien racist i couldnt see my objectives becuase a huge black wall would appear in front of it and it is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit i will uninstall this game forever and go play Men_Of_War assault squad a real strategy game mowas is soo much better than ths junk and in mowas there is an editor though complicated this game is stupid and i will never waste money on sequels ore anything even if it is on sale screw this gameeditsorry i raged quite a bit when i wrote the review now 2 years after uninstalling i downloaded it again the new steam version and it worked perfect i have played heaps already and i am soo happy my favourite strategy game is back in action thankyou whoever changed the game u r the best1010perfect"

The_Community,"at first i was not 100 sure about buying or passing mostly owing to the simple art style and the fact its a tower defense which are a dime a dozen now days however after looking at reviews and seeing some high praise and checking the forms and seeing active devs interacting with The_Community decided to give it a trythe first thing i met was a user agreement which is fairly common now days however unlike others i actually read it was very simple and easy to understand made a nice impression and told me about their attention to detail before even accessing the first screen of the game this attention to detail was further proven once within the game the customization in just the options menu alone warrants this game being noticeable i cant say if you will find it worth your money but if you have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket or see this on sale well worth full price in my opinion grab itthis game and its developers are like a unicorn in this day and age they clearly care about their players and the product itself will be keeping a eye out for future releases from themif you have any doubts look at a few of the stickied threads to see the developers love for The_Community and the game and notice that to date there are 377 positive reveiws and only two negative p"
The_Community,"im sorta torn on my opinions of this game while gameplay is definitely fastpaced and fun some game mechanics are a little broken imo for example some of the duelwielding smgs can three shot you in the knee and still kill you while some of the assault rifles take 45 shots through the chest also some players who have played the game and the series for a long time will have better perks and weapons so they can just get a few easy kills get a massively overpowered killstreak reward and dominate the entire game The_Community could also use a little dusting up visuals are nice and run smoothly on old pcs and games can be fun if played with the right people of similar skill level price tag is very overpriced imo for a game thats two years old and already has had 2 sequels released in the period"

The_Community,"i remember seeing this game around a year ago lets say it was good then but its even better now maybe not everyone likes this game but the amount of detail put into this game is just amazingthe game is about running a prison and it sticks by it your prison is in your hands but my favorite part is that its not fully in your control sure you can assign patrols and use non lethal but very effective tools to placify an inmate but even with that you will always get terrified if one prisoner starts rioting and they take out a weapon the guards can fight them but they attack other inmates then its the matter of getting a guard asap to the area or risk a life or 2 and recently when the ability to fail was added suddenly you couldnt let the inmates escape or let a riot go on for too long which made it more intense when a riot broke outthe developers themselves are probably the most best ive ever seen they never get off track with other ideas as explained in one of their videos but they take ideas from all the players and get The_Community and are now working to wipe most of the bugs out of the gameas mentioned before not every person may like this game partly because of the amount of patience needed but i dont care in my opinion also the freedom of the modding community is perfectthis game takes the idea of running a prison and strategy and mashes it up into one game would i reccomend it of course i have put hours not only building my own prison but downloading others huge riots fires and a prison built for 16 must quickly be adjusted for 45you dont have to but to sum all of this up in 3 words they would be buy this game"

Tf2,"this game is absolutely amazing if youre a hardened fps veteran or even a newbie you will definitely enjoy this gamefirst off i have never played any quake or unreal games so im very new to the fps subgenre that ratz occupies so this game was completely new to me but boy what a breath of fresh air it wasfirstly the graphics never have i seen a game with such simple but at the same time elegant graphics having such simplistic graphics not only makes the game look nice and modern it also helps you spot the enemy rats that could be lurking around the corner just waiting to shoot yousecondly the level of customisation in this game is astounding you can customise your fov so you can either be like a quake pro or have a call of dutyesque fov like me but thats not all you can also customise your laser colour type enemy colour gibs crosshair and team colour you can also disable the ingame music so you can add your own heartpumping music to suit your playstylealso the gunplay is very barebones but at the same time very fun and enjoyable everyone gets the same beamshooter gun which means that no one is every at an advantage over another player and therefore who gets the kills is determined purely by player skill rather than a weapon advantage also if youre familiar with Tf2 or other games where shooting rockets at your own feet is beneficial youll love this game the beam jumping in this game is so fluid even at a high ping that youll be impressed by the mobility you can achieve with your beamshooter with the jumping you can constantly strafe around the map but you can also reach strategic map positions that can help you gain an advantage over your enemiesthe maps in this game all have their own unique style and ive also noticed that they all seem to have a different colour palette for example one map may be predominantly green coloured while another could have mostly red tones all maps which ive played seem to have a good balance between stratergy and fun although some maps are definitely more enjoyable than others in the end no matter what map is chosen you should have a blast playingfinally the gamemodes due to a lack of players ive only been able to play deathmatch so far which is enjoyable even in its own right the other gamemodes are classic staples you have duel capture the flag and survival i cant really talk about these modes since ive never played them but according to other people they are great fun to playoverall this is an excellentlymade game that excels in all aspects of its design from the gunplay to the customisation you should have an excellent time playing ratz"

Starbound,"so far i have only played 36 hours of Starbound and i would certainly recommend this gameproshas quite a lot of features considering it is an early access game that might be because it is nearly out of early accessome people might think i am talking rubbish here has very little bugshas a very detailed character creation giving you the ability to customise your character to your likesmusic is also very nicethe interface is very easy to used to and after a while feels naturalto expand on reason 1 you can upgrade your ship mater manipulator basically starter mining tool that can mine everything but slowly every race a little back story to it you can get special abilitiescons some quests are a bit ridiculous eg for one quest i travelled at least 3 solar systems trying to find a floran villageto sum it up i think it is a pretty polished up game and it has a lot of content and will sell well"

Portal,"this game projects a similar atmosphere to that of Portal 2 puzzles both simple and complex a very institutionlike environment and an almost complete lack of storyline or context that leaves you wondering at the very end wait whata brilliant game that is well worth the money"
Portal,"ignore everything you see and hear while playing this game because your senses will lie to you countless times i believe polygon nailed it when they labelled it a mobius tripa brilliant game full of simple yet complex tricks and puzzles that challenge you at every corner while instilling upon you a deep and meaningful rhetorici would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the puzzles present in the Portal games"

Evolve,"i really enjoyed dead by daylight when i could get a game they basically took the concept of Evolve but did it much better the only problem i have with it is that it takes forever to get a game because it only searches for a couple of seconds and if it doesnt find a game it says no matches found and you have to click search again which can get really annoying if they fixed the searching i would say it is one of my favourite games but i just get bored of waiting to find a game and its not like you can go watch youtube or anything cause you have to click search every 5 seconds"
Nether,"the game has very nice graphics that could be improved on as well nice smooth controls when skulking around pun intended as you dont have to constantly hold down ctrl like in avp although you do find yourself stuck on little objects a fair bit and it is a challenge to sometimes get on the roof of a room however im not saying that is a good idea as you will have trouble getting to your enemy before you get shot making it sometimes difficult to get away although due to the small objects that are included you cant easily blend with the wall you can however easily use the small pieces to do nice leaps from wall to wall to accelerate youthat was only talking about the graphics and skulk though as the aliens or karah you can evolve into different types flying slashing tank and the cute support allowing you to also evolve to the new types each set with separate abilitiesthe marines look like they have it tough but in fact they do not as the marines being equip with an arsenal of ranged weapons along with jetpacks allow them to dodge attacks and kill something before it get to themusuallyit may seem that the game has a variation of 2 gametypes to play fast and abusive or slow and stealthy but there is also a third variation the commander without the comm commander you will be screwed and without a good comm you will also be screwed as a comm on either team are required to be able to place support structures and upgrade you this means that if you are more of a good strategy top down player then you dont have to go looking for another game honestly its like 2 games in oNetheres one major floor with some of the levels though some are too wide this makes it nearly impossible for the karah to win there are some rooms where the moment the marines capture it the karah arent able to even enter the room as they are to wide open there is also glitches in the maps that stop the comm from placing connection nodes called cysts these cysts are the karahs way of transferring energy where you are meant to be able to an annoyance is that sometimes you will get base rushed and thats the end of the gameno joke once your base is attacked within the first 15 minutes you are placed in a permanent disadvantage this problem is in many games though and can not be solved by devs so nearly every player on this game has a mutual understanding not to egbr early game base rush so it is currently quite rare to see a base rush within 15 minutes or so of a match startinganother major problem is the difficulty curve due to the fact that there is practically no training trying to understand how to play properly and learn how to dodge bullets is simply not possible the training in the game is mostly just a movement tutorial as the bots are veryunresponsive although there is a video tutorial which helps when trying to understand the games mechanicsin total ns2 is well balanced and if you stick with the game long enough it will end up being incredibly fun it only takes about 1 hour to fully understand the game well for me it didi almost forgot to mention the loading times take about 510 minutesgraphics extremely smooth controlsmultigenreteams are nothing like each otheracceleration physics used as mechanicoriginal character varietyproper stealth mechanicscharacter traits stay for only that character typemodding supportbias mapsmap glitchesegbr problemanti egbr community mostlydifficultylearning curve trainingpractice modehelpful tutorialbad bot ailoading timesscoring22 pros8 constotal 14 prosnnumber of conspros totalaanswer depends on cons majority or pros majority 01667na 50166714233457310"

The_Community,"the game alike its brethren endless space has stunning graphics however it is styled in 816 bit ie the game keeps style with the old bitlike games but does not look completely like an old cartridge game the game play is surprisingly smooth and easy to understand but the game gives quite the challenge regardless what character you have or how skilled you are every level and play through you will have to think strategically and place defences so you also have to keep a constant watch on your heros life as well make sure that your producers are all equal or close in production or focus mostly on one type as you traverse through the seeming less endless floors every item that you get holds a big value even if it is a stray jacketthere are a few glitches left in the game but all are being fixed quite constantly by a very active dev team which are probably the most friendly dev team you will ever come across and The_Community even friendlierthe music is done by flybyno the musician for the well known endless space has again created more masterpieces the music in this game is very well thought out as the music does not make you have to battle with it in order to think of strategies rather it helps you while setting the mood and vibe very well the calm music slow paced and thought inventiveness is what makes the entire game so relaxing most of the time yet so frantic at othersthe multiplayer however is still having difficulties but has only recently been released so is technically in beta still the multiplayer regardless of your upload speedsdownload speeds has a big lag problem which is getting much better slowly over time as it isnt amplitudes forte but they have worked with multiplayer on turn a based game beforeat first glance the game looks entirely turn based dote is part turn based part strategy and part real time the turn based comes from the doors and the material obtaining being that each turn is counted in doors the strategy is obvious planning where you will go and where certain things go along with the difficult choice of weather should i have all defence in here or make it a place for my heros to healor both will be asked about in every room that becomes available to you to place defences an the such there is more strategy in the characters as well as you will have to plan who gets what and who should have what role which becomes even larger and harder to do in multiplayer more on that later in fact you even have to plan your escape finally the real time comes down to doing all of the above whilst being attacked placing defences watching your health equipping items you name it you can do it in real time when the waves of monsters are outmultiplayer doesnt only have problems with lag or randomly disconnecting but also somewhat in communication and majorly in sharing items when there is an item no one knows what the chest holds so no one knows what the item is until they pick it up once the item is picked up instead of the item going into the global inventory it goes into the personal inventory which if you cant equip the said item for any reason you cant drop it nor trade it in any way this makes the game more difficult as loot gives more bonuses and traits than levelling meaning your entire team is more likely to die unless you all get luckynext problem is communication due to the lag building things and claiming a room becomes more difficult as more than one person may try buildingclaiming at once the only way around this currently is to let the host of the server to buildclaim meaning your entire team will depend on you if you are the hostall up the game is well balanced not pain numbingly boring even after a few plays and looks very good for its chosen stylegreat graphics design smooth controls very easily understandable simple tutorial awesomely challenging extremely well balanced multigenre active devs extremely friendly devs extremely friendly community perfect music multiplayer very laggydisconnecting multiplayer very interesting mechanics mutiplayer inventory problem muliplayer communication problem 34 pros8 constotal 28 prosnnumber of conspros totalaanswer depends on cons majority or pros majority 01667na 501667264334593349310if the mutiplayer was fully fixed and the tutoral a bit more advanced ie more interactive it would be a 1010"

Loadout,"this is truly and excellent online freetoplay game it is brilliant it is original engaging and very impressive you play as a tenno which is basically a space ninja which uses a warframe as armour i guess and there are dozens of warframes you can choose to play some are better than others for different things like speed defence attack etc there are three types of weapons you can use melee range and a secondary for each of these you can choose so many different oneseach weapon and warframe can only be obtained through crafting which is in real time like an hour a day 3 days etc but you can speed it up with money but ill talk about the microtransactions later the parts for each weapon are either boss drops or mission rewards and some require special quests to obtainyou can customise Loadout with different cards to offer the warframe and weapons better stats these cards can also be improved to give the warframe and weapons even better stats cards are dropped in missions and by bosses they are crucial to levellingthere are a lot of missions that can be unlocked there are some 30 missions on each planet to choose from which is on a randomly generated map there are also several different mission types like survivals defence elimination and many others each planet also has a boss where defeating them will unlock a different planet to go toyou can also create a clan build a dojo trade parts with other players customise your warframes weapons and space ship oh you can also have a kubrow which is a big dog basically or a drone thing there are different breeds of kubrow and different drones and they all have diffrerent qualitiesthe microtransactions in this game are not bad the game is free after all you can spend real money on an ingame currency which can be used to purchase items to improve the warframe or to make items building to be built instantly all items that offer to improve your weapons or warframe that can be purchased with this currency can be gained simply by playing the game and theyre usually not all that difficult or time consuming to get there are certain things which can only be gained by buying them but theyre only surperficial and do not influence gameplay in any way another note about this you technically dont need to spend your real money to get the ingame currency either there is an ingame trade system where you can trade cards and warframe and weapon parts plus several other things which can be paid for with the currency so if you have a certain gun part people will pay the money for it similarly the game offers frequent login rewards which can include up to 75 discount on the currency simply for logging into the gamethe game can become very repetitive at times while the game does offer a large amount of mission types and locations to perform these missions nevertheless you will begin to notice that youre just consistently doing the same thing which is fine but you notice it also some warframes and weapons are exceedingly rare to obtain and so you will be required to farmgrind bosses or the void for these items this can take a lot of work to get the one itemas much as i like this game i stopped playing and for the several attemps i have made to start playing again i simply have been unable to get back into it i am not entirely sure why but i would assume it is due to the repetitive nature of the game and also because the game is frequently updated and new content is added so by trying to play again after months i felt somewhat lost with new items and questsfor the time i spent playing this game i enjoyed it very much and i know people who have spent thousands of hours playing and call this a perfect game i think it is at least 910"
The_Community,"after wasting my life playing this game for several days worth i still have no intention of stopping as this is a fantastic game like all games there are good things and bad things the bad things in this are occassionally hackers matchmaking waiting times slow servers and bugs that are not game breaking but annoying and also the occasional ungrounded hackusation mostly from people that dont understand the game the good things far outweigh the bad The_Community is very friendly and rarely toxic maps are detailed and destructable gunplay is usually tight the game is tactically inclined no running and gunning like cod rounds are short gameplay is often completely different each round etc etcits not a perfect game but it is very very good 8510"

Well_There,"this game starts off really well as the transition from the old 8bit era to the 3d part is pretty cool but this transition happens in a space of half an hour and the game turns for the worse after the game becomes 3d after that it becomes a bad zelda and final fantasy clonethe turnbased strategy is way too easy as your partner has a heal spell that is effective considering how little damage the enemies do she doesnt do a whole lot of damage except for xcrystal but the hero can do just as Well_There is no limit on how many times you can use her spell and it heals both characters at the moments when she isnt around you have enough money to buy a bunch of potions to last you until your partner comes back because of this the battles will get boring and mindnumming very quickly and youll start running from battles just to get past themthe actionadventure gameplay isnt as bad as some of the levels have intresting mechanics like shifting back and forth from 16bit to 3d but these sections dont last as long and they dont get repeated they shouldve stuck with these ideas as it couldve added more puzzles and ways to get around them instead it focuses more on the combat which is stiff to say the leastoverall it takes a lot of ideas some from other games and some entirely unique and sticks it all together instead of getting a few ideas and expanding upon thoses to make the game feel like an exploration through the actionadventure genre rather than a game that took ideas from other games in hope of it working well combined the fact that the game is really short and that its 10 this game isnt worth getting"

Starbound,"best scifi game sound track ever this game has sucked more hours away from me than dayz but it does it in a non intrusive kind of way unlike dayz where you feel every second of every minute of every hour of the day Starbound eases you into a false sense of control what was once a quick 11pm mining run easily and unnoticeably turns into a 3am dash for cash to the center of the earthbeen playing a little of the single player campaign to learn the ropes and get a feel of the mechanics but this game really shines with a few mates online in a locked down server working together for hours and hours on end crafting building hunting looting cooking etc many a times have we seen the sunrise while playing this game and thought to ourselves another day at work with less than 3 hours sleep totally worth it"

Css,"gta v is the great masterpiece of rockstar that is like mona lisa to leonardo da vinci it was originally released on xbox 360 and ps3 in 2013 i will be honest here i got into the hype and preordered the game just because i knew that it would be the definitive sequel that gta iv needed so badly and the expectations did not fail short from the trailers i loved it all the story the driving draw distance shadows combat and the way the guns feel online wasnt great for me but at least i got compensated along with many others 500 from rockstar themselves as an apology for the issues in october overall it was amazing to say the least with my experience and it was well rendered on 8 year old hardwarenow here comes the remastered version for xbox one ps4 and eventually pc now i didnt buy gta v for the consoles because i knew the pc version would outclass the consoles themselves and i am happy to report that gta v runs well on my laptop dont ask the texture quality is superbly increased tenfold and makes the game livelier i got more immersed playing it on pc more than the last gen consoles but the nextgen would also show similar immersion results modding is also an advantage for pc players and you can now rest easy that rockstar wont ban you for modding in single player i modded the game to have the scripthook mod and radio stations on foot making the rampages more entertaining than the ingame music for the graphic obsessed tuners there are a ton of options to tweak them to your liking with many types of antialiasing such as fxaa msaa and nvidias txaa with shadows amd has chs while nvidia has pCss if you are confident in adding more beauty there is the advanced graphics option and boy does it punish your pc in performance a lot but the results are worth itbut wait there ' s one thing also that the pc version has that the consoles dont have support up to 4k definition more on 4k later the movie editor included is a crafty equipment for when you want to make many genres of television and movies or recreate your best moments and brag about in youtube or the social club personally i am really confused about how it works but i prefer modding mayhem to anything else first person mode which was present on the next gen consoles is still present on the pc version and adds an extra layer of immersion to top it off the animations and the extra detail such as floating garbage on run down streets and cockroaches on the floor in trevors trailer make it more realistic in detail than in thirdperson now about 4k you need a super sli or crossfire to manage up to 60 fps in performance wise but it pays off as it looks dropdead gorgeous to look also if you were an originally playing the game before on oldgen and you have a social account linked to you online account for xbox live or playstation network you get special perks such as a railgun hatchet dukeo death stallion murder mysteries for noir filters animal photography that unlock a new submarine dodo seaplane monkey mosaics that reward you with a gogo monkey blista and exclusive cars that can be won by racing in new muscle races now there are more variety of animals that can be found in the game and you can even play as them by finding peyote plants and chewing on them also there are two new radio stations one of them is the lab while the other one is selfradio now in order to get it working put your music in the documents under rockstar gamesgta vmusic and place them there it ' s a great update to the game rather than just simply making it nicer for the eyes unlike some other gameshowever not everything is perfect several areas of the map can drop the fps and the launch was a bit of a disaster as people reported that their usernames were causing gta v to not launch at all the download times were also painful when you launched the game after you finished you preload because there is a day one patch for the game that is mandatory and it took me almost an hour to launch the game because of the slow download speeds and the size of it next thing is i had to update my drivers because the fps were fluctuating and it annoyed me beyond irritation however this did not stop me from enjoying the game also you must have a social account because of the launcher requires it it will be mostly annoying but seeing as i already created one it didnt bother me much from a techincal povthe online heists make finally an appearance before and thats also the selling point for going back again other than the expanded amount of people that can go into a server up to 30 players not much has changedbut where does this lead to even if it had a few hiccups the pc version of gta v is definitely the definitive edition and i do appreciate the effort that rockstar did even though delaying it is frustrating the result is a pc game that you shouldnt definitely miss it towers over gta iv red dead redemption and max payne 3 in graphics capability i cant wait for rockstars

The_Community,"the alpha of h1z1 was off to a very rocky start the game was absolutely riddled with bugs rendering it almost unplayable and to make it worse we found out that while soe had said that the only buyable objects would be cosmetic we later found out that this was not the case every person on the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit server with a couple of bucks to spare was calling in an air drop giving them guns tools and food so that they would have a major advantage over the competition but luckily those days are far behind us thanks to one of the best alpha development teams i have ever experienced they listen to what everyone in The_Community says most bugs are fixed within a day of them being reported and the rest they choose to keep working on full bore until they are fixed and i must say thank god they fixed the air drops air drops are now easily able to be seen by whoever is in your corner of the map the range in which they are dropped is far greater meaning that as opposed to you buy an air drop and you get it you are instead having to compete with a barrage of other players for your prize and finally the drop rate of things like guns and other weapons in an air drop has been dramatically reduced so that they won ' t set you to far ahead of the competition this has all helped to turn the game into a far more playable and enjoyable alphaif you want to get an idea of what the game might be like then just picture this day z but made by a far greater team with superior skill and coding knowledge who will in turn choose to listen to what their players ask for and fix every bug that crops up this game is how day z should have been the forest could have been and rust will never bei must put this out there this game is the most fun that i have ever had in an alpha or even a beta for that matter and i am putting that down to the wonderful team of devs behind itthe animations though only in alpha are beautiful and fluid there is a smooth transaction between different actions and a polished look to them normally only seen in finished games the graphics while not that bad could definitely use some texture updates before the final release of the game as they are currently looking a few years behind schedule but that is only expected in an alpha and finally i must just put it out there to all you gaming bullet fans that this is currently the most polished and enjoyable alpha on the steam market and thanks to some beautiful optimization it is playable on most average systems but never fear if you are currently strapped for cash but wish you could still play the game it will be free to play to the general public upon final releaseone thing that i have currently forgotten to mention is the beautiful design of the games ai zombies are as dumb as they should be and not much of a problem alone but are attracted to things such as sound meaning if you fire a gun at the wrong moment you could have a pack of as large as fifty zombies hunting you down at once which can cause quite a problem the way they have designed and built this ai really impressed me they act exactly as you would imagine a zombie should dumb and only a problem in numbers and this ai design has carried over to other creatures found in the game world from skittish deers to ferocious wolves ready to attack anything in their sight and terrifying bears who once locked onto you are probably some of the most dangerous creatures in the gamethe combat in this game has been beautifully designed the actions are smooth and you are actually able to feel the power as you send a fist flying into a zombies head as they send a hand back flying towards you the weapons while in most cases rare are very powerful and will give you a huge advantage over the competition while items such as combat knives and machetes will give you the upper hand in close quarters combat a bullet from any of the guns can be absolutely devastating but remember that a gunshot can be heard miles away so be careful not to attract the horde or worse another human hungry for your bloodso have i enjoyed h1z1 in the two short weeks this game has been out it has come so very far from the buggy pay to win mess it once was to the beautifully polished and enjoyable alpha it is today i must say that it is hands down the most enjoyable alpha or even beta that i have ever played it has been twenty dollars well spent and all thanks to the amazing team of helpful and responsive devs creating it i would strongly advise any of you zombie or survival fans out there to give this work of art a try and all that i am left to say is that i can honestly not wait for the next big update and eventually the final release of the game soe you have really outdone yourself this timecheck out more reviews and previews at gamingbulletcom"

Tf2,"best game i hav ever played similar to Tf2"
Tf2,"i loved this game however i can not recommend this game after the most recent update Tf2 was the game where you just jumped in and mucked around you looked up the servers you wanted to play on and jumped in and out at your leisure their latest update has killed aspects of the game that i lovedvalve removed all of their servers from the browser they had the best servers you could vote for the next map kick tossers and hackers now you are left with community servers there are some out there that are good but are prone to advertising plugins and admin abusehackers delight pray to gaben that you dont end up with a hacker in casual play in my last game the opposing team had a blatant hacker i dont call people out for hacking at a whim and even his own team acknowledged it however in the new casual mode there is no way to remove these players from the game you cant vote kick them off if you leave you get penalized for abandoning the game which is ludicrous who the hell thought this was a good idea you assume the recovery position suck your thumb and wait for the round to end then wait for the next vac ban wave and hope its sooncasual play randomness you cant choose what game type you want you can minimise the randomness by clicking a few buttons and then hope for the best if youre proficient at multiple maps then great if not there isnt a way to choose specific maps or guaranteed a game typeword is some of these things will be fixed doesnt seem likely theyll return the valve servers to the browser real shame that"
The_Community,"this game is every thing i was wishing for its flawless gameplay combined with not being hard to learn plus this game gets straight to the point which makes it a excellent choice for someone who likes to have fun instead of spending 10 minutes trying to figure out what everything does as of yet while im still learning the game in many ways i have not won a single 1 v 1 match and The_Community is rather small but they are friendly and easy to get along with apart from one guy who was raging over the fact i was using strategy in a strategy game if u get this game and cant find a player match bot matches are fun with a smart ai that makes you think your opponent is a human player although i recomend trying to get a friend to play this game with as the game is much more enjoyable with friend to play it with"

Garrys_Mod,"today i will write a review on the game called Garrys_Mod i will review the modes single player and multiplayer seperatelysingleplayer mode in single player mode Garrys_Mod becomes a sandbox for the people who play it you go onto a map made from either another game or made by the Garrys_Mod team or by yourself in single player the player will start off with an avatar a variety of weapons and tools and their own creative mind if they have one you will be given a large list of things to use such as npcs weapons entities and props by yourself you can make anything that comes to mind for example a slide challenge or a rollercoaster maybe even a scene from a movie if you feel like giving the gaming world a taste of your creativity you can submit your creation to the world of gaming the only annoying things about this is when you only have a limited amount of suppiles due to not having a certain game created by the same people who made this one valve i have to say that if you want a bit of alone time whilst playing a game but you dont want to be under pressure you might just find that this is just what you need you can choose to go on a rollercoaster which is rather boring in my opinion or you can do something as crazy as having to fight off a large horde of zombies all at one with your only weapons being a machete and a crappy pistol which doesnt take long for me but i find it quite enjoyable so if youre looking for a game game mode thats lets you do almost anything you want this is what you might just need multiplayer mode multiplayer mode provides you with a large variety of game modes stretching from role play to being a traitor among terroists these game modes allow you to play with people from all around whatever country you come from sometimes even other ones this could make you a social butterfly or it could ruin your life the game mode i find most sociable is trouble in terroist town more commonly referred to as tt there are hundreds of different things to do over the multiplayer mode and you can do it with friends too just a heads up is that most of the servers are run by a group of people so dont intimidate them otherwise youre heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ed there are millions of possibilities in multiplayer mode you can do things like go on adventures in sewers or build a bridge out of bathtubs the one thing i found irritating about this is the lag spikes but i guess thats my own fault so if you want to be with friends while not with friends and have fun with them doing a large number of different thing this might just be thing youre looking for okay so now for the pros and the cons ill do them seperately for each modesingleplayer modepros1 a chance to be alone and share creativity2 give yourself a challenge3 lets you do almost anything you want 4 you can make the most simple things as random as you like cons1 you might have some trouble if theres something you want to do with a friend it may not let you 2 only lets you use the equipment you have from the games you own3 if theres soemthing youre really desperate to use it might not be avaliable or it could take too much time to get set up4 somethings you expect to be a challenge end up being easier than expected giving you nothing to domultiplayer modepros1 lets you do something specific with friends which can bring more enjoyment to whatever it us youre doing2 lets you socialise with other people make friendships maybe even relationships3 if in a bad mood beating others or ending up being the one on top can make you feel good 4 being out numbered in a fight can fill you with adrenaline and make it more exciting for youcons1 certain things you do could have a bad affect on your life career or reputation2 modes can get rather plain and boring after a long period of playing3 restrictions4 not every person you meet will be nice there are total heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit s on this game but they normally float from server to server which wont cause you much problemsin general Garrys_Mod is an incredible game made of games it is a whole other genre of gaming almost mastering singleplayer and multiplayer mode it is almost a world made from the minds of people just like you and mei recommend Garrys_Mod for anyone who is looking for a new experience in gaming and can have fun by playing either alone or with friends this is a game for any age honestly they just have to know what theyre doingmy final rating for Garrys_Mod is 84Garrys_Mod you certainly dont disappointthis is susonme signing out game on gamers"
The_Community,"note keep in mind the game must be paid for in order to play at the moment as it is in early access it will become free to play at around the end of the year also a lot of the negative reviews on the front page are complaining about issues that have been fixed or changed or complaining about features that are not in the game yetin my opinion this game has a lot of potential even though it is currently in early access it feels like it has enough replayibility to keep me going for hundreds of hours with the latest update now here are some of the pros and cons for the game in its current statesome pros pretty art design the way it is done gives the game a more toon feel to it alot more enemy diversity compared to dd1 the game is regularly updated with the latest patch adding loads of content in to the game the people who work on the game interact with The_Community and hold developer streams on twitch every friday according to the developers there wont be dlc map packs so The_Community wont be split the music in the game is good the towers have more personality as i would call it once it goes f2p it wont be p2w betsy and cute propellor cats if you do buy early access you get 30 worth of ingame currency to buy costumes witha few cons its in early access so you have to pay to be able to play it tavern is laggy and the game feels slightly unoptimized uber skill spheres cost waay too many wyvern tokens i call the tokens betsy bucks level cap that does not take long to reach level cap will be increased later on earlier maps become meaningless to play once you hit level 25 they are adding incursions soon for them to make them playable in late game again bug paradise no controller support yetnote most of the problems i have with the game a due to the game still being in development and a lot of the features are not in it yetfinal verdict while the game is unfinished and has its fair share of problems its fun which is what people really look for in games 810 in its current state"

The_Community,"this would have to be one of the best early access titles that i purchased being a big fan of the original installment when i heard about the second installment i was excited did this game manage to live up to the excitement yes definitely the only flaw currently that i have found is the lack of content but this game is in early access and more content will obviously be added from the as of 24042015 4 hours that i spent playing this game both solo and with friends i feel like this game has incredible promisethe goodvisuals this games visuals are stunning the graphics have received a very nice upgrade from this games predecessor without taking away from the style that the first game portrayedperformance this game has very good optimization i was able to run the game on medium to high on my low end pc and still manage a stable 60fps with only a few ocassional dropsgore the gore system got a massive overhaul which just makes it so much more satisfying to blow the heads off of zeds and watch it literally explode spraying everything in blood each zed has a huge amount of points of dismemberment so you can quite literally tear them limb for limbui the user interface got some heavy tweaking compared to the first game making everything more sleek and easy to access the vendor pod has a very nice interface as well with everything laid out infront of you without having to scroll down or acrossclasses although only 4 of the classes are available at this point in time the skillsclass perks feel rewarding for the effort you put in sdk the game has been noted to have the sdk and community creations implemented later on in development which is great as i found The_Community creations one of the best parts of the first gamehumour thats right the wonderful british banter from the first game makes a comeback better than ever i mean who doesnt love british people insulting zombies pdosh aww yis the dosh now has physics you can literally make piles of money grab it while its hot ladsthe badenemy grapple this could be considered as nitpicking but the new way that the zeds grab you is quite honestly a pain in the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit when encountered with large crowds it can be quite annoying being spun around every couple of seconds having to bash a zed away only to be grappled by another one and spun around i personally preferred the grappling from the first game where they just slow down your movement until you cant moveservers im giving the game credit with this one but im just going to list it here for the time being since i consider it a negative part at this point in time currently the servers that are available are almost all full with only a few with much higher latency being available all of the ones with great ping and empty are privated however this wouldnt be too much of a problem but as of this point in time the method for creating a dedicated server for the game is quite tedious also im not sure if this is a glitch but 90 of the time when a game is finished i am often sent back to the main menu screen even on my friends gameall in all if youre a fan of the original installment id highly recommend picking this up if youre a bit sceptical about purchasing games that are in early access id probably suggest giving this one a miss until the price drops for a sale as there currently isnt too much content if youve never played the first game in the franchise but youre interested in zombie survival games such as left 4 dead i recommend giving this game a try i can definitely see myself sinking more hours into this game as it develops"

Evolve,"httpyoutubejk6clrdbwzqfirst person shooter roguelike games are absolutely rubbish mostly due to the lack of polish and performance they are usually clunky and under perform in every instance but ziggurat has blown that whole misconception out of the water this nicely polished game has been developed by the independent team over at milkystone studios and they have struck gold with the development of this title ziggurat came up out of the blue for me and i absolutely love that being able to trawl through the steam store and finding gems like this is fantastic with all the flaws steam has it redeems itself with creating a platform for indie developers to showcase their games you take control of a character that possess different abilities which aid you through your adventure or disadvantage you in some cases as with most roguelike games the difficulty scales upwards when you venture deeper into the dungeon enemies become more complex and you need to formulate strategies to progress or with will die the game rEvolves around magic which makes for a great foundation for a roguelike exploring deeper into the dungeon you find perks that enhance your character examples include increasing mana pools health damage or speed finding secret rooms sacrificing resource for luck or other resources the amount of customization of your character is endless which makes for amazing replayability the levels are randomly generated like most roguelike titles are venturing through these dungeons you can come across any number of rooms such as labyrinths trap rooms secrets and other mysterious encounters finding secrets is one of the most thrilling things you can do in any roguelike but in ziggurat finding secret rooms reward you with perks that are usually only obtainable through levelling up which just adds to the enjoyment or frustration when you eventually die and lose everything that you had ziggurat also has some puzzle and platforming elements which are actually integrated pretty well into the title discovering a lava room with some moving platforms makes the player realize that this game is not all about killing monsters and obtaining loot but more of a mental challenge as well having enemies with depth and varied abilities is almost a staple in any great roguelike game this demands the player to tackle the room in different ways to counter the enemy types no one play through will ever be the same due to this feature enemies range from murderous carrots all the way to giant blue blobs which will devour you if you ' re stupid enough to approach it when entering the dungeon you are given a stock standard wand that does suffice for the first level or two but the game really starts to get interesting when you need better weapons for the upcoming fights so you desperately look in every last corner for weapons and spells that will make you so much stronger than you were before the mana pool is in 4 separate parts purple orange blue and green these colours represent what kind of damage is dished out by the different weapons that use the respective mana pool mana is depleted extremely fast which makes for some daring decisions to run head on into enemies to grab that extra mana that is needed for you to use your magic the game looks amazing the texture quality of pretty much everything has this kind of cartoony feel about it but it also has a great feel and atmosphere towards it the model design is quite good also having many close encounters with the enemies you can see that the design quality is very high and this is something that usually falls behind when talking about fps roguelikes but ziggurat pulls it off quite nicely finding loot is probably the most exciting part of the game finding items and perks for the first time always creates mystery to the run being able to apply different weapons to your strategy and rotation makes you play differently in every room the weapons feel awesome the weight and different specifications of each spell and weapon makes for a good time if you ' re into fps or roguelike games you should definitely check out this title even if it ' s just for the innovation alone you will not be disappointed the mixture of great level design graphics sound quality and great loot really makes for a fun experience"
Evolve,"sum up good expensive ios portplague inc is an ios game around the 5 mark or your regional equivalent in saying this a price mark up of 10 is not something that a lot of people may think kindly to but if you do enjoy death simulators or something that involves logical thinking with some dynamic game play pick it up for the 15 or wait for the sale the game involves evolving a plague many to choose from to eradicate the human race the gameplay is created from number crunching and strategic thinking towards the extinction of the human population graphic quality is not great in this title little is able for customisation but the requirements for the title to run are quite minimum this is an early access as stated before and buyer should beware of this many game states and even options are still under development and only those who want to be involved in the development and social process of the game should buy it pre full release features such as multiplayer and scenarios are not completely functioning there are two tiers of multiplayer in my opinion the first consists of leaderboards and the social network sharing the second tier consists of the incomplete multiplayer mode which can only speculate to be a completive mode that heads you against another player in realtime hopefully game play itself is identical to the ios predecessor you infect one country to begin with and mutateEvolve the plague to achieve total annihilation of the human race and ultimately winning the game at the end of the game scoring does occur which allows you a placement on the leaderboards for more information do check out my perception check video on this title httpwwyoutubecomwatchvtguhpx5ghqsfeatureyoutube"

The_Community,"this is by far what arma 3 should have been The_Community the game the engine is all how a military simulator should be i have not joined a single game without friends that wasnt a well co ordinated game and all round fun for our squad and the rest of our team the gameplay is captivating and the environments are incredibly immersive the sounds are 1010 from gravel crackling under your shoes to the sound of bullets flying past narrowly missing your skull great game so far has so much potential and the developers work extremly close with The_Community cant wait for vehicles to be implemented next month d"
Terraria,"this game is utterly amazing its beautiful cheap and has an infinitely better lore than Terraria the best part its still in beta"
Loadout,"great game until they turned off the au servers now i effectively dropped 100 on starter packs etc that are unsuable this happened relatively close to release and eor is not offering refunds when the servers were taken down they made no effort to notify customers or respond to questions on forums on social media or their forums for well over a week the worst part is that when they tried to justify the reasoning is that they said it was due to poor match making when its clearly just the cost of servers vs population match making was as bad if not worse after switching off au servers and latency was significantly worse actually barely playable in most casesas such feel free to play Loadout its a pretty sweet game but i dont recommend paying eor for anything or expecting them to treat their customers in a remotely fair manner i dont think at least a partial refund would have been unfair as what was purchased is now of no use to me due to changes on eors part"
Tf2,"to be truethis game changed my lifei cant thank enough to Tf2 the best first person shooter of all just by hearing the music when you open the game of some theme of Tf2 i have that feeling of courage to enter on a server and rekt everybody its just so greatand when i get the premium account that ive been waiting for 5 years 5 years of playing Tf2 withouth tradinggifingjust 50 space on inventory i cryed of hapiness thank you valve for the greatest game of allgabeen can we have new weaponspleaseplease"

Sanctum_2,"Sanctum_2 is one really the only fpstower defence game no game has dones something like this before and had the risk of majorly failing coffee stains studios did extremely well in their game theyve put so much detail into every map and enemy coming from their first sanctum they really kept it up even though there are big changes it will still feel like the first one both games rely heavily on your strategies there are multiple ways to beat the level but there are always those setups that beat every other i have to say coop is where this really gets the fame and attention it has playing a normal tower defence you are by yourself just watching things happen sanctum solo makes you feel pretty awesome as you are taking down waves after waves but when the coop starts things get much better you and your friends will be jumping all over the map blasting enemies to pieces and having a great time i have played a lot more solo than i have coop but i definetely like coop more you get more people to with resources to build your towers two extra guns and 3 perks to switch with the choice of perks and weapons and towers are very important you dont want to take an antiair tower into a map with no flying units thats a wasted tower and you dont want a perk that gives you speed increase if its a map where you dont even need to run and you can stay still the whole time there are perks and weapons for almost every kind of play style from cover sniper to rocket launcher madman and your classic assault downsides difficulty is random as the story continues and i dont mean if you do well on one level it suddenly gets hard i mean that you can be going through easy levels then the next 2 are extremely hard and it gives no warning suddenly gets hard then drops back down it will cause frustration but there is a restart button if you get stuck lag i know this isnt the games fault but if you are playing with someone and one of you has lag or gets a random lag spike it really downs the game and makes it impossible to play properly if lag is an issue for you stay away from cooptroll weapons im serious there are some weapons in the game that look like they have been made for trolling other players they have serious knockback and will pss people off a lot it sends the person being shot flying and knocking them off the map in the middle of a big fight this is one of my favourite games because its just works brilliantly in so many ways there are more things i should talk about such as how great the game looks and the little minigames featured but i wont thats for you to experience"

Portal,"review in shortairmech is an action rts game taht takes a twist on the genere of rts gaming this game is a mix of RIRE with a game like starcraft you control a characterhero that is your airmech and there are creeps that spawn from your main base every so often you can build your own units to fight by your side from a vast selection of units gameplay is usually fast and intense with plenty of aerial dog fighting and battlfield micro this game is casual player friendly with opportunities for the more competetive playeronly problems are if youre an aussie finding people to play with can be quite difficult lag is also an issue if you are an oceanic playerfeel free to add me in game and set me as your referrer shameless selfpromotion p my name is virusalpha and im one of the few australian playerspros lots of customisation a crapton of customisation possible fair business model not pay to win casual player friendly intense gameplay frequent updates balance changes and bug fixescons not many oceanic players meta shifts frequently post updates which may or maynot be a good thing meta meta meta a lot of high tier players use the same tactic strategy and loadout people like to use the best units best setup and best strategy however if youre skilled enough you can work around it can be staleslightly longer reviewadding on to the abovethe meta shifts a lot when big updates come and rapidly change after balance changes this is probably a good thing however the game can become borning when everyone adopts the meta there is a tremendous selection of pilots airmechs parts and units the problem is balance achiving perfect balance and harmony is far from near thier are hunderds of units to use but generally high tier players pick the same 810 why because those units are best theres tons of pilots but players tend to choose 3 because they are the best theres 9 airmech classes but professional mainly use 3 this is just one of my dissatisfactions of the game there are unitsmechsitems that completely outclass others which is sad balance is yet to be achived in this game which is forgiveable because its still in betathe games busienss model is fair or even great everything can be purchased for in game currency which is amazing a casual player can unlock plenty of items in 1 day you can unlock all units pilots and items for in game currency which is amazing this currency is called kudos the premium currency in this game is diamonds and the game gives you 500 to start with with thos amount you can buy whatever you please but you can not buy power you can earn diamonds through quests but these diamonds are locked until you make a purchase of anything in game and obtain silver vip or higher its an incentive for you to invest money in the game with the smallest purchase avaiable being 5usdgenerally diamonds are used to buy cosmetics to look fancy and ultra classy you can buy ultimate variants of units which are unbalanced and super overpowered but these can only be used in solo play player vs ai coop and custom games these units can not be used in regualr unranked or ranked pvp generally these items are for noobs p hence upon starting the game you receive a random ultimate unit in your inventory new players these days are very lucky you get free items and cosmetics as you play the game this is just a taste of what you get when you purchase diamonds its an incentive to purchase diamonds and if you do i suggest gettin the starter pack as it gives you best value for your money so try out this game if you havent already if you dont like it simply uninstallthis game has a drop system in this drop systems you can receive crates cosmtics pets consumale items stuff and rare unit alternatives which can not be purchased normally this drop system is fair and gives you cool stuff which you can sell on the player market if you wishthe market is acessable when you reach level 10 which isnt hard at all even for a casual player at this level you can purchase stuff on the market at level 50 you can sell stuff on the market all items on the market are sold for premium currency unfortunately reaching level 50 is gon na take a long time however after a purchase and obtaining silver vip the marketis instanly acessable and for use if you are not a vip after selling an item you only get 30 of the diamonds you sold your item for with the rest being locked so for instance if you sell a hat for 100 diamonds you only get 30 there is also an ingame tax of 15 so if you want to sell and earn 100 diamonds your item will be listed for 115 diamonds once sold you get you 100 diamondstheres loadouts in which you can customise evrything you need for a game you can choose up to 8 different types of units to put into your loadout there are infantry light vechicles trucks tanks big tanks even bigger tanks artillery healing radar units traps turrets and socket units that provide speical effects you have a 9th slot for a guardian that provides unquie effects such as healing radar and for extra damage out put in your loadout you can customise your airmech you can change airmechs customise its parts change cosmetics and a whole lot of other stuff you have a slot for an item which provide small buffs finally there is a space for your pilot which is very important as pilots usually depeict your play stylethe game has a crafting system which lets you craft a wide range of items but is restricted on current items you habe and your levelin terms of gameplay you will always be using your airmech to carry your units across the map you can pick your units up and micro them there are mass commands for macroing tanks are the main unit composition with support units such as healing and radarartillery jamming there are many ways to play this game this game features outposts once captured they provide different effects and raise your upkeep yes you have upkeep you use hot keys to build units and collect them from eitehr your fortress or outpost to place on the ground and assign commands outposts and fortresses provide healing outposts are occupied by 4 infantrycreeps and can be neutralised by killing all 4 you can capture an outpost by filling it with 4 of your own infantry or creeps you can use the outpost to your advantage by healing from it and producing units and deploying them from there generally if you have more outposts than the other guy youre well ahead in winning the game there some sockets on your fortress and sometimes a few on your outposts you can socket your socket units onto these to activate them or provide buffs to turrets to are 2 ways of winning a game the first is by having your opponent leave p the other way is by reducing your opponents fortress health to 0 there 2 ways to go about it you can do it traditionally by knocking on their door with an armyconvoy of tanks or by capturing all outposts on the map putting you into the dominating postition while the enemy in in domination their fortress slowly takes adamage after a 30 second warning this game mechanic promotes movining out and not slwo turely gameplaythis game often referrences other games and has special events often for example you can find the Portal cube sentry turret and minecraft creeper in game also the game also features a referral system in which you receive rewards thats why you can find total biscuit the cynical brit huskystarcraft and chimmney swift in the game oh yeah about these events special seasonal items are sold such as in easter you can buy a jesus pilot and during christmas you can buy santaif rts is not your thing the game is often called farmmech as you have a basecamp you can grow and builds stuff its like farmville heh bunny farm op"

starting the game you receive a random ultimate unit in your inventory new players these days are very lucky you get free items and cosmetics as you play the game this is just a taste of what you get when you purchase diamonds its an incentive to purchase diamonds and if you do i suggest gettin the starter pack as it gives you best value for your money so try out this game if you havent already if you dont like it simply uninstallthis game has a drop system in this drop systems you can receive crates cosmtics pets consumale items stuff and rare unit alternatives which can not be purchased normally this drop system is fair and gives you cool stuff which you can sell on the player market if you wishthe market is acessable when you reach level 10 which isnt hard at all even for a casual player at this level you can purchase stuff on the market at level 50 you can sell stuff on the market all items on the market are sold for premium currency unfortunately reaching level 50 is gon na take a long time however after a purchase and obtaining silver vip the marketis instanly acessable and for use if you are not a vip after selling an item you only get 30 of the diamonds you sold your item for with the rest being locked so for instance if you sell a hat for 100 diamonds you only get 30 there is also an ingame tax of 15 so if you want to sell and earn 100 diamonds your item will be listed for 115 diamonds once sold you get you 100 diamondstheres loadouts in which you can customise evrything you need for a game you can choose up to 8 different types of units to put into your loadout there are infantry light vechicles trucks tanks big tanks even bigger tanks artillery healing radar units traps turrets and socket units that provide speical effects you have a 9th slot for a

eitehr your fortress or outpost to place on the ground and assign commands outposts and fortresses provide healing outposts are occupied by 4 infantrycreeps and can be neutralised by killing all 4 you can capture an outpost by filling it with 4 of your own infantry or creeps you can use the outpost to your advantage by healing from it and producing units and deploying them from there generally if you have more outposts than the other guy youre well ahead in winning the game there some sockets on your fortress and sometimes a few on your outposts you can socket your socket units onto these to activate them or provide buffs to turrets to are 2 ways of winning a game the first is by having your opponent leave p the other way is by reducing your opponents fortress health to 0 there 2 ways to go about it you can do it traditionally by knocking on their door with an armyconvoy of tanks or by capturing all outposts on the map putting you into the dominating postition while the enemy in in domination their fortress slowly takes adamage after a 30 second warning this game mechanic promotes movining out and not slwo turely gameplaythis game often referrences other games and has special events often for example you can find the Portal cube sentry turret and minecraft creeper in game also the game also features a referral system in which you receive rewards thats why you can find total biscuit the cynical brit huskystarcraft and chimmney swift in the game oh yeah about these events special seasonal items are sold such as in easter you can buy a jesus pilot and during christmas

Loadout,"review in shortAirmech is an action rts game taht takes a twist on the genere of rts gaming this game is a mix of RIRE with a game like starcraft you control a characterhero that is your Airmech and there are creeps that spawn from your main base every so often you can build your own units to fight by your side from a vast selection of units gameplay is usually fast and intense with plenty of aerial dog fighting and battlfield micro this game is casual player friendly with opportunities for the more competetive playeronly problems are if youre an aussie finding people to play with can be quite difficult lag is also an issue if you are an oceanic playerfeel free to add me in game and set me as your referrer shameless selfpromotion p my name is virusalpha and im one of the few australian playerspros lots of customisation a crapton of customisation possible fair business model not pay to win casual player friendly intense gameplay frequent updates balance changes and bug fixescons not many oceanic players meta shifts frequently post updates which may or maynot be a good thing meta meta meta a lot of high tier players use the same tactic strategy and Loadout people like to use the best units best setup and best strategy however if youre skilled enough you can work around it can be staleslightly longer reviewadding on to the abovethe meta shifts a lot when big updates come and rapidly change after balance changes this is probably a good thing however the game can become borning when everyone adopts the meta there is a tremendous selection of pilots Airmechs parts and units the problem is balance achiving perfect balance and harmony is far from near thier are hunderds of units to use but generally high tier players pick the same 810 why because those units are best theres tons of pilots but players tend to choose 3 because they are the best theres 9 Airmech classes but professional mainly use 3 this is just one of my dissatisfactions of the game there are unitsmechsitems that completely outclass others which is sad balance is yet to be achived in this game which is forgiveable because its still in betathe games busienss model is fair or even great everything can be purchased for in game currency which is amazing a casual player can unlock plenty of items in 1 day you can unlock all units pilots and items for in game currency which is amazing this currency is called kudos the premium currency in this game is diamonds and the game gives you 500 to start with with thos amount you can buy whatever you please but you can not buy power you can earn diamonds through quests but these diamonds are locked until you make a purchase of anything in game and obtain silver vip or higher its an incentive for you to invest money in the game

Css,"man this game has got to be my most favourite game of all time you can probably tell from the amount of hours played d it is my most favourite game because it is extensive and fun because of the amount of content it provides this content includes downloadable maps weapons vehicles and more from the in game workshop and plentiful servers to play on i would definitely recommend it to any that is thinking of getting it because it is worth your time and your money pros a workshop that contains tons of varied addons to download plentiful servers to join plentiful gamemodes to play very good game to play with friends especially on certain maps it is extremely funny because of the physics and addons the game runs easily even if you have a bad computer you can spawn in things other people have made cons the graphics arent amazing but acceptable the servers on gmod use a lot of Css counter strike source textures meaning that you need to buy Css to see the textures although you dont need to do this but it is recommended because it will enhance the experience for new players setting up a private server to play with friends may be hard i watched tutorials on youtube on how to do it some addons take a while to download especially the larger file size addons and servers that you join require you to download the servers addons content although it really depends on the speed of your internet if its going to be fast or slowoverall this game is worth it and its only 10 10 freakin bucks dgmod receives a final overall score of 810"

The_Community,"i only have a few problems with dirty bomb from the 5 hours that i have been playing spawn campers yes the other team has the ability to spawn camp you and vice versa it needs to be fixed perhaps set up different spawns when the enemy gets too close to one of the spawns matchmaking is unbalanced for example i am only level 5 and i have been matched up several times with people that are lvl 20 and up they have access to much better guns classes and have much more experience and really for them it would be a sinch to beat all the low ranks on the opposing team unless we spend a good ammount of money we have to slowly grind to get the credits needed to get new classes better than the default ones and trust me it is very slow if you never win a match i have yet to find any aimbotters but damn sometimes i feel the need to question it also from what i have seen in alot of matches alot of The_Community playing is very toxic other than that the game is pretty good but these things need to be fixed probably not the toxic community however that will never be fixed for now i will not recommend this game but that could change"

Csgo,"if you are like me and want something more than the run and gun lack of strategy call of duty then Csgo is for you with its thrilling competitive gameplay its really a much better experience Csgo provides and enjoyable ranking system that pushes the user to play there best and engage in team based strategy at the higher levels as low ranks suck and are salty unlike cod and other fpss you can derank if too many games are lost however on the other hand there are negatives like hackers which can be a real pain and overall ruin the experience and the saltiness of the low silver ranks this is not really a bad thing but there are weapon skins that can be very expensive and if you dont restrain yourself you will have yourself throwing out the dosh in order to gain some of these sexy skins overall Csgo gives and amazing strategy based experience it has its negatives but are highly outweighed by the positives i recommend this game to anyone seeking a more skill based experience with less of the rpg style of cod cause lets face it cod is all about leveling up you character and getting new weapons a lot like other rpgsi hope this was helpful"

Evolve,"after 2 years of playing this game i spent more time playing the nonsteam version because of personal hardware restrictions back then this is what i think is a f2p 3rd person coop shooter done rightbelieve me it is not exactly pay2win but more of a pay2skipthewaitingprocess even then its usually worth the wait for most partsat first new players might be overwhelmed by the content of this game and that is true since the tutorial didnt really offer detailed explanations on how each of the features work however with the help of the wiki and its community it should be easier for them to sink in to the gameplayalso the leveling system here is a bit different than the usual mmorpg style first of there are two types of level in warframe1 gear rank each and every warframe and weapons will have these that can be leveled up to rank 30 every rank gained will provide more mod points for inserting mods which in turn will improve their overall performance2 mastery rank this pretty much depicts your overall ranking in the game higher ranks will unlock more weapons to use mastery ranks are increased by maxing out the gear rank of each and every new warframe and weapon youve obtainedwhile its heavily based on grinding just remember these three things1 every warframe has its own unique set of skills and playstyle and every weapon has their own strength and weaknesses youll eventually find the combination that suits you the most so go and experiment with all of those gears2 everything can be obtained without spending actual money warframes weapons resources consumables can be crafted aside from the majority of cosmetics and quick access to specific resources the latter can still be obtained through grinding and trust me whenever youve actually decided to spend money on this itll be worth every damn cent3 may rngesus be with you because like i said before warframe rEvolves around grinding aside from modding your gear so if repetitive gameplay isnt your cup of tea this might not be for you although thats pretty much how most lootbased games go you can choose pay to skip certain parts of the grind but remember that even then most of the better gears will not be available until youve reached a higher mastery rank in the gameall in all if youre up for some fastpaced third person shooter with good graphics and content id heavily recommend this you get to be a gunslingingbladeswinging space ninja spreading death and terror throughout the solar system what else do you need"

Evolve,"this game has a great bases for more content though i think it is a bit short though that definately does not mean i didnt enjoy it its gameplay while sometimes showing minor bugs is overall good it is fluid and all the guns feel great the rEvolvers feel like the best guns in the game but that is because i only use rEvolvers but in any case this is a game that while not being a huge game it is definately worth its price and if a havent convinced you with this review then at the very least consider it when it goes on sale"

Evolve,"early access reviewthe road so farark survival Evolved has its flaws currently as all day one games in ea but it has a lot of potential it has a deep levelling and crafting system requiring time and effort in gathering and crafting its combat is kind of clunky but once you unlock that slingshot youll never go back to just bashing a dinosaur while i haven ' t manage to tame a dinosaur yet started to tame a carno that had attacked my house but when i went to kill a couple of the massive turtle dinosaurs they wrecked my house and the passed out carno c i think it ' s an amazing and fun engaging mechanics making you care for that one pet you will value over the rest so far only the graphics to play this are letting it down in my opinion my specs below i hope with more optimization and when dx12 comes out soon it will get a lot better to list this outpro ' sdeep rewarding crafting systemlevelling systemmassive open world full of horrors and things that want you for foodfun tribe system with friendssolo offline mode allowing you to learn and get the hang of the game before onlinedevs actually seem to care and have updated the game and fixed bugs all thoughtout day oneconsrequires graphics tweaking even for higher cardssome small physics bugs eg bodys flying and being tossed away abitmostly the biggest con for people is it requires a beast of a machine and even then you need to tweak the graphicsbut after all that i ' ll keep playing it because i so far find this the most enjoyable survival game outcomputer specsprocessorintelr coretm i74790 cpu 360ghz graphics cardnvidia geforce gtx 760 ramkingston hyperx beast 160 gb osmicrosoft windows 81 64bit upgrading my gtx760 soon to a new gtx970 about 2ish weeks awaywill update my review when its installed ive played iti wish there was more than yesno for review early access games but so far if you can tweak the graphics right i recommend this over other early access survival gamesthanks for readingdeatheffektupdate 1 patch 171511 hours mostly all in game i doubt even an hour is in the menuserver list and i honestly say if you can get this running get it ive loved every second of itthe updates since day one have been great the game runs way better for me atleast and looks amazing the hard work the devs are doing will pay off and i honestly see this being finished one day if they keep doing this"

Dota_2,"Dota_2 has consumed my soul and my friends along with it"
Evolve,"one of the reasons why i got this is because i liked retroEvolved but when i played it there was no retroEvolved like mode so i didnt play to much untill i heard the developers released an update saying that a retroEvolved mode was getting added so i started playing again and i say it was worth italso the developers should add a part where players can make their own levels and add it on workshop"

Team_Fortress_2,"wowi really really want to like this gamei dont know i guess i could go back to defiance first of all hasnt this game been coming out for like the last 9 years i was excited when i first caught coverage of it like 34 years ago but and secondly the game just looks awful graphically it looks like they are trying to marry the look of borderlands and Team_Fortress_2 and it just falls flat admittedly i have only started playing and as i play more i will update this review but the controls are weird you use the left trigger on your xbox controller to run left bumber jumps wtf some of the intro ai supports looked kind of interesting but if youre buying this as a kindof pc fpsmmo to rival the playstation 4 game destiny i think youre going to be pretty disapointed as ive said im early on and i will update this review i bought one of the starter packs for the game so im playing now but if you want to check it out it comes out and is freetoplay on the 29thin the mean time i have an beat access code for destiny on my ps4 so im going to go and play that oh yeah and pleease when you do a patch update the graphics theyrewell ive said that already"
The_Community,"amazing game should give it a shotprobably one of the best or the best mobas available atm with finding the right people in The_Community can be great and make some great friends on australian servers it doesnt seem to be as toxic as other people say game is hard to learn once you start playing but its well worth it once you pick it up never get bored because every match is in some way different over a hundred heroes all free to play and to master only use of money is cosmetics which has no actual effect on the gameplay itself only giving the hero a unique look this is my most played and favourite game and i dont see myself getting bored of it anytime soon 1010edit 2564 hours in still not bored"

Evolve,"ark survival Evolved is a fun and beautiful game i have played countless hours with friends and i have never been bored by it there is soo much to do in this game whether it be trying to tame a dinosaur you want or building a bridge to link the many forts and homes you will build i have never experienced playing the game on the epic settings but i have seen a few youtubers play at those setting and my oh my does the game look great now you may be wondering why i have not recommended the game that is due to the many problems that ark faces such as extreme memory leaks and subpar optimisation the memory leaks are a big problem for me as the game seems to eat up my ram and spit it back out at me i have heard the devs are trying to fix this issue but all i see is more content being put into the game which is good but also making the memory problem worse on mine and my friends pcs on multiple forum posts and other friends first hand experiences i have heard memory leaks of up to 23 gbs not very healthy for a computer if you ask me p all in all ark survival Evolved is a great game but it sure does need some tuning up and until some of the problems are fixed that are causing people like me and others to not be able to play the game properly i cant recommend the game to anyone unless they have a highend computer but if you really want to play this game i recommend that you atleast have 16 gbs of ram available if you want to run the game with modsedit i also forgot to mention that ark survival Evolved has some of the longest loading times i have ever seen so if you are fortunate enough to have an ssd with some room on it then install ark on there"
The_Community,"epsilon is not bad for what is being charged at the moment epsilon in its current state prealpha performs surprisingly well on lower end systems and looks half decent aswell epsilon features a few of the game mechanics that made the old tom clancy games great such as being able to preplan your mission rainbow six 3 the fiber optic camera to scout underneath doors splinter cell and eventually rainbow six and the ability to open doors incrementally to provide much more cover when scouting a room for enemies and making entry kills rainbow six 3 serellan llc are known for the subpar game takedown red sabre but it appears that the devs have taken into consideration what was wrong with the game as a tactical shooter and fixes a few of the problems in epsilon however it does carry some of the problems over like the somewhat sluggish movement system and the insanely fast reaction times of the enemy ai at times epsilon for what it is worth at the moment is not bad but you may want to hold off buying the game until some of the bugs and gameplay features are ironed out all in all i like where this game is heading and it is great to see tactical shooters like this and ground branch coming back into the gaming worldalso a message to the devs if they end up reading this dont be afraid to ask The_Community for suggestions on how to improve the game as we all want to see this become an amazing game and we are happy to help to make this game become better than it already istldr versionpros follows old style of tactical shooters such as rainbow six 3 and swat 4runs decently on older systems as far as i knowconsai isnt that great to be expected in a prealpha gamegame has bugs to be expected"

The_Community,"completely free game kicks heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit they should sell this game its so good comes with map editor you can mod the files if you are hosting your own server so i imagine this will be supported by The_Community for quite some time if you havent got it already download it and get some friends together for a good time the game only comes with one campaign which you can finish in a few hours but it is fun and as i said there is a map editor so you can download many more off the steam forums or other places"
Css,"i recently went back and played both chaos rising and the original campain and everything just kinda clickedi realised that i did not enjoy them the first time i played because i never really got into the campains and kept trying skirmish i really loved dow dCss both had great campains and multiplayer features but dow2 is not these games it went from command of a large millitary force to a tight sqaudhero command game now at first i hated this but over time i found extreme joy in both campains of dow2 but the multiplayer due to lag and this new gameplay format i have found that it is the play style that works great in the campain but fails to capture the same feeling in mp unfornately retribution does not carry over this unique sqaud command play style into its campain and replaces it with the skirmish system for some reason even after making two games with this sqaudhero command system also while you could port your commander over from dow2 to chaos rising you can not do this in retribution and forces you to play as diomedes which is lame all up they screwed the continuity of the campains which just ruined my experience but last stand is very fun get some mates and youll have a gay old time there is joy to be found here sadly just not the same joy youd get from the first two games i do reccommend this game though as i did find joy but still kinda a let down with the campain"

Half_Life_2,"probably the weakest half life episode but still a fun game it picks up right after the ending to Half_Life_2 and thats all ill say without spoiling too much the story is definately the main thing that keeps you going in this the gameplay is very repetitive with not much variety it was pretty much like go into a new area clear out area repeat the game is very short but i consider that to be a good thing considering that if the game was longer than 5 hours most people would became extremely bored with it quickly with all the repeated gameplay however if you loved Half_Life_2 you will most likely love this next episode despite all the cons"

Dota_2,"ok ive reviewed it before but i feel like i should review it based on a perspective of a marvel fanboy an avid gamerthe game is really fun to play especially when you play this game with friends yes you either need to pay or work your way to a new hero but games like these expect you to work hard for rewards and working is better than just buying your way to victory graphics are ok for me on my laptop i like the fact that their adding more more heroes as the game grows i also like the fact that their adding more more to the story of the game making the game much more hyped for new players you got heroes voiced by some of the most talented voice actors ever like deadpool voiced by the great nolan north the gameplay itself is enhancing you get to experience different movesets per hero get to really play your hero more in order to perfectly master their moves with pvp soon to be out of beta the ingame dialogue and the fact that heroes can actually have conversations with each other is down right awesome more heroes great story hard work just wat you can expect from mmorpgsand also i also saw a review that a person does not recommend the game because he wants the game to be optimized to xbox controllers try playing Dota_2 with an xbox controller then update your reviewoverall yeah get the game it may be high in memory their may be big updates but throughout all that its all gon na be worth itscore for marvel fansavid mmorpg gamers 9510score for nonmarvel people 7310"

Tf2,"it is a great game overall although i would want to have more maps and game modes make the match making faster that is not the case however it shows the true face of a paytowin game it feels like the developers slapped me in the face for not spending a dollar on their market a shame thats what it is it had great potential although the cash shop overpowering your opponents by spending money ruins it and no its not me being bad im great at the game but you can never dominate a player who has the best ingame items no matter the skill then it becomes frustrating to play you will eventually quit it like i did so i beg you spend your time on something else like Tf2"
Csgo,"better than Csgo because its simply more directmakes more movement such as climbing over and using ladders propperly with hands stealth kills since the characters all are technically robots and half human with most part of their bodies being prostetics for human use and combat seems quite reasonable that they are hard to kill throught the head but is still not necessarily hard to shot someones head over 4 times in less than second since the rapid fire weapons can do the job just finethe graphics are amazing the music is deep and motivating is ways that would want you to keep perseverant depending in what kind of person you are mentality stabilitygraphics effects are good when headshot kill on an enemy occurs sometimes the head would be in pieces and see the insides or see just the half of the head remaining attached to the body kills made by explosives will mostly torn your character into pieces and usually the extremities will the ones getting off the bodies arms legs sometimes the head or half torso etc theres too much detail the little issue is when someone is getting shot theres gon na be a lot of blood splatting per hit most games would make the blood be spilled and stay on the surfaces this game doesnt do much of that but its that much of an issuethe combat skills such are tier 1 and tier 2 in most characters are fitting on science fiction and real science such as optical cloak this is an example is not necessarily accurate due the movility would disturb this ability you can download the tier 1 version of the team mate if they use a tier 2 skills its temporal and weaker but still near similar to the original character whom you downloaded the tier skill works as long as youre near host of the tier skill and up to 3 other players that are not youtheres currently two female ressembling characters on this gamei could say more of this but i think this is enough for now this game is great for casual play or competitive play if it gets further such as having a competitive community it has the potential for iti give it 1010 shooter game with science fiction and covert arts"
Team_Fortress_2,"awesome and addciting game really fun when u have one or two of your friends play with you the mechanics are sort of similair to that of Team_Fortress_2 with the rocket jumps the only downside is theres not enough maps to play on and overtime the maps get boring otherwise great game"
The_Community,"great game fun with friends but also fun while your playing by yourself The_Community is good and you can see your feet i would give this game 110 you have to put hours in to be good at the game and unlock things i guess you could say its a bit of a grindbut its so rewarding when you get the good weapons its also easy to get xp by doing the right things in the game the graphics arnt the greatest but still you are still able to deal with them"

Portal,"this is most likely one of the greatest sandbox games on the steam webstore with plenty of things to do from making a floating piece of wood with some decorations to a motorised bathtub to a fully functunal ship or just stack up wooden objects and set them on fire and if the vanilla version doesnt grab your tastes get some addons this game has an outstanding number of addons that can be downloaded with a click of a button some addons are made for great new building experiences take expression 2 and wiremod for example with the use of wiremod you can create working doors and other things not that good with wiremod so cant give detailed explanation and with expression 2 you can make holograms teleporters and big explosions although this is an amazing game and i highly recommend it to anyone whos looking for a unique sandbox experience there is probably only one thing that i dislike about it and its that if you dont have certain games like half life or counter strike some textures and models wont work this include black and pink checkerboxes and big flashing errors signs luckily i have found a way around this check out this website to get free models and textures from games such as Portal half life and counter strike link removedhttpkajar9wixcom heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit 2 go to the garrycontent tab to gain access to the resources this is not piracy it is not letting you play seperate games for free it is simply giving you textures and models for gmod other than that issue i give it a rating of 910 definately got my moneys worth"
The_Community,"i used to play this game hours on end unfortunately when i came back The_Community was dead there were no players anywhere apart from the few newbies wandering through the starting area hoping to find a good game i would only recommend this if you like grinding hours on end and spamming repeats to level through most of the game as well as completing raids with only a few party members and in most circumstances by yourself"

Evolve,"i have been playing payday 2 off and on since it came out i have bought all of their dlcs even the completely overkill pack so that i could support overkill and help them bring new content to this game but the new weapon rebalance and black market update have destroyed all faith i had in overkill if you have played cs go or have seen crate openings it ' s exactly the same thing when you complete a heist you may earn a safe that can only be opened by purchasing a drill when you open the safe youll earn a random weapon skin with a random condition ranging from brokenin battle scarred to mintcondition factory new this would be alright if it wasnt for one detail weapon skins can give you stat buffs that ' s right a cosmetic actually improves the killing power of the weapon it might improve accuracy stability or total ammo pretty much any stat who thought this was a good idea this is a pay to win mechanic and the weapon rebalance has destroyed the weapons either making a weapon extremely under powered or over powered rEvolvers do more damage than some sniper rifles a dmr does more damage than a sniper all shotguns except for double barrelled shotguns were nerfed to oblivion and most pistols are one shotting enemies on the highest difficulty these changes have rendered the game completely unplayable and i will not be returning to payday 2 until these issues have been fixed i should also mention a humorous bug that is currently in the game the minigun used to give a movement penalty and had mods that would reduce the movement penalty they removed the minigun movement penalty but not the mods ability to increase speed meaning with both speed increasing mods for the minigun you run faster with it equipped than any other weapon"
Evolve,"at the current state the games content is mostly Evolved around escort everyone and babysit everyoneaside from the quests which makes the story more interesting gathering resources became a one man job mostly because you can only call for 1 scavenger at a time and they will walk to the destination and collect a single sack of loot then return home which seems helpful at first but later found out these so called scavengers will very often stuck and call for help which then the player has to go and bail them out alot of cases when i finally get to them there is very few zombies around the scavenger will not move until the area is clearedmoving onto the combat there is one thing bugs me greatly at home base suppressor can be crafted in the work shop which is used to allow guns to be silenced until it is worn out but there is no projectile weapon such as crossbow and bow either these and the arrowbolt they use will be much easier to craft then the suppressor itself and produce less noise when used compared to a firearmmelee combat seems interesting at first but i found it very lacking in damage progression at max fighting skill level it will still require at least 2 swings with a heavy weapon to get the zombie into a state where excute mechanics can be used power attacksprint and attack does virtually nothing better then a normal attack except more time consumingthe quest generally consist holding off zombies and clear the area or hunt down a certain zombiemy conclution the mechanics of this game in general has out paced its stories since it keeps adding timed events which will penalise the player for missing them on top of the quest story supply gathering and the restriction around those so you can not do more then 1 quest at a time even if they consist the same sort of goal multiple supplies can not be loaded onto cars and must be carried by someone in order to take homeedit 1 since it has been updated and i will go back into playing this for a bit and make changes to my review"
Terraria,"Terraria is an amazing game many people compare it to minecraft but its much more combat based with bosses beasts in the night and countless weapons from assault rifles and bows to swords and magic spells however it has no storyline quests or any of the sort yes you can do fishing quests and catch specific fish for the npc but more of storyquesting would improve the experience just a bitoverall its crazy fun especially in multiplayer completely recommended910"
Dont_Starve,"Dont_Starve is an incredible game the graphics are a unique and endearing style the controls nicely set out and the challenge of the game all combine to make it what it is probably one of my favourite parts about this game discluding the graphics which i love is having only one life you die its game over unless you have stumbled upon a rare touchstone granting you an extra life you have to be ready and think ahead to avoid losing everything and when you get to low health its time to go into panic mode there are so many dangers keeping an eye on your hunger picking flowers to avoid going insane having enough light to last through the night and all the monsters found in this game make it an amazing experience the crafting aspect of the game is also very nicely done collecting the resources and building the machines you need to advance further into the game the only downfall is the inability to multi this game and share this experience with your friends it would be amazing to be able to play Dont_Starve with your friends competing against or looking after each other but sadly it is not able to be done all in all this game is an unforgettable experience that i will keep coming back to time and time again to try and get further than i did last time and to see what i missed out on because i hadnt made it that far yet910"
The_Community,"this game is geuinely great and it gets better if you make the smallest purchase on the steam store The_Community is massive and has its own trading currency built into it by the millions of fans out there i love this game because the 9 classes are so balenced and well made and any server you play on is fun no matter the map1010 the true savior"

Undertale,"alright first of all first of allive been a huge supporter of Undertale since its kickstarter campaign in 2013 but i didnt entirely know what to expect from the games full release to be honest i was nervous as to whether it would be as good as the 40 minute betaand after beating the game im at a loss for wordsthis game has almost all the aspects of a lot of other games that i truly admired for years before even knowing about Undertale but Undertale it gets those features that made games like cave story and mother 3 and ramps it up to a solid 11its clear that toby fox and his other colleagues behind the creation of Undertale put years of dedication passion and love into this gamemaker studio trade_mark title and for what it is it exceeds all expectations but thats enough about the game in general allow me to discuss the key elements of the game that will make it worth your timelets start with the gameplay itself as that is the central core of the gamethe gameplay is very similar to that of the motherearthbound series in which you control a child which you then promptly name this child then stumbles into a vast labyrinth deep under a mountain known as the underground and its your task to escape said caverns the underground is full of what are known as monsters a race of often anthropomorphic creatures with some exceptions as you make your way through the caverns you begin to face monsters in combat wherein you can choose to slaughter them or persuade them to see you as friendly and to leave you alone each option equally difficult to execute also in combat you dodge enemy attacks by moving your characters soul out of the way of their projectiles which adds in a fun bullethell spin on what would otherwise be a generic turnbased rpg fighting systemsecondly the art the artstyle is for what it is consistant to the nature of the game itself while still managing to display colour and variety for instance you could be talking to a beautifully sprited handsome skeleton man one minute but then in the next room youre caught face to face with a mishmash of shapes colours and voices beckoning you to sit down and share a glass of water with them on a note of the art present in Undertale the battle scenes while purely in black and white rarely sporting coloured geometric backgrounds are beautifully animated making it seem like the characters themselves arent just static sprites but actually friends and foes challenging you to a match of wits and strength however while a lot of the overworld sprites charactersobjects you encounter when not in combat dont have shading it still suits the beautifully crafted room textures and landscapes overall the art in the game is far above average and is both beautiful and emanates a sense of purpose into each roomalso musictoby fox is quite the renowned musician when it comes to quality video game music which adds another entire layer of perfection to this game each song is written to convey a message or a story or to give life to the already lustrous scenery and battles i myself was already a huge fan of tobys work in the hit webcomic homestuck so i knew from the start that this games soundtrack would be an absolute treat to listen to i promptly bought the soundtrack as i bought the game itself on steam and might i say it was a wise investment the soundtrack of Undertale has over 100 individual songs each one a blissful tune which i believe may become wellknown classics in vgm historynow lets get down to business lets discuss my favourite part of the gamethe charactersgood grief i have never played a video game with such nuanced charming and overall relatable characters in my life each character is blessed with dreams goals ideals and individual quirks which shape and mold their personalities into unique fun and heartwarming characterscough cough mom i mean toriel or even thoroughly despicable loathsome characters cough cough which may end up being some of your favourite charactersthe story im gon na keep it quick for youUndertale has in my oppinion one of if not the most engaging and satisfying stories ive ever seen in any video game laughter sadness hatred remorse empathy and cruelness are all emotions that i had felt while playing and feeling like a part of the story not just watching some child and their endeavors i find this is because the characters interact with you as opposed to just sitting there watching the characters sort out the situation like a third wheel its a genuinely intreaguing experienceso there you have it what do i think of Undertalei think its the most marvelous video game ive ever had the honour to play1010 an a effort by toby fox and the team behind its creationaheh ssorry about everything flowey"

Dont_Starve,"okay so im a noob at Dont_Starve in general but here goes my first impressionsday 1 attempt 1 woke up on a small island with few resources saw some crabs walking around on the beach and decided to build a few traps i caught a crab and was about to light a fire to cook it when i realized id depleted all my grass on making the traps and died alone and cold in the darkday 1 attempt 2 i spawned a similarly small island this time and was a bit more prepared i gathered all the wood and grass on the island and went down to the beach this time i set aside some grass for the fire and dropped it on the ground and went about hunting crabs while i was hunting it got real windy and i noticed my grass blowing swiftly across the bay away from me i gave chase but it reached the water before i could catch up i died alone and cold in the dark againday 1 attempt 3 im not screwing it up this time i had a fire going by dark and enough food for a few days this was gon na be easyday 5 attempt 3 ive made further than i thought possible ive set up a base in a beach biome got all the tools and even have a small boat with a sail this is awesome i also rather cunningly used a pitchfork to take some swamp biome to my own base and grow swamp trees for an unlimited supply of wood eat that bear gryllsday 9 attempt 3 i feel so great at this point i killed some spiders and built a net to catch some fireflies now i have a lantern on my boat my swamp trees have fully grown has well and my wood harvesting has begun on the second tree a yellow snake dropped out and bit me once i died a slow toxic deathfk this fking piece of st1010 would die in every way except starving again"

Loadout,"recieiver games rarely consider the details of ammunition the amount of rounds a player carries shows up as a number in the interface and reloading requires nothing more than tapping a button actually handling and managing the bullets that go into a gun is a complex task however receiver an firstperson shooter fps from wolfire games wants to remind us of that fact unfortunately it never makes it clear why we should carereceiver drops the player into a randomlygenerated set of rooftop rooms and tasks him with recovering 11 tapes of droning narration without subtitles and that explain the games story the player begins with an unpredictable Loadout including one handgun in one of various states and some ammunition the player may also start with a flashlight or if his gun is semiautomatic a spare magazine or two he must then move through the multitiered linear world looking for the tapes which can be frustrating since one can go through at least nine rooms in a row without encountering a single one i myself havent managed to get all 11 in a single playthrough before dyingthe game only has two kinds of enemies a stationary gun turret and a flying drone both of which can kill the player with a single hit each has some associated visual cues but most of the time the player will need to hear their alert chirps to know when hes been spotted and when its safe to move the distribution of enemies changes and on rare occasions they can be avoided because enemies are difficult to evade and pickups can be hard to see however killing everything in a room is generally the only optionreceiver started as a response to a sevenday fps challenge and definitely feels like it from its spare graphics to its roomentry stutter the hook for the game is that it presents the process of actually reloading the firearm in a significant level of detail the hud has no ammo count and bullets do not magically fly from the corpses of your enemies into magazines the player can swap out every time he takes a breath rounds must be gathered manually and loaded into magazines by hand with the gun safely tucked away if theres no spare magazine the player has to eject the empty refill it then shove it back home again the only way to know the number of bullets remaining is to remember how many have been fired or check by eyereceiver fails to establish that the complexity of gun handling matters the detailed reloading scheme doesnt speak to the story the aesthetic or the other mechanics receiver doesnt treat aiming or shooting the weapon with the same carefulness it reserves for reloading and doesnt fiddle much with the basics of movement yet running and shooting are the core verbs of the game by making the world randomly generated the developers give up the opportunity to design encounters where efficient reloading matters as a consequence becoming more skilled with the games most intricate systems doesnt make a player any more likely to succeed receivers complex gunhandling mechanics are irrelevant in the context of its larger designthats a shame because the larger design has nothing to recommend it the perfunctory story and lowpoly world of receiver arent interesting to explore in their own right much less when one must overcome the games unforgiving difficulty the choice to generate the world randomly might add replay value but it also adds much to the frustration level while costing the game the ability to present rewarding encounters that highlight its unique mechanics receiver has a neat idea at its core but that didnt translate into an interesting gamefinal score 35 4 10"
Terraria,"at first glance Terraria seems to be a lackluster indie game with a clunky confusing interface and a list of crafting options a mile wide especially for you minecraft transplants you ' ll initially find the flat sidescrolling perspective a bit offputting after countless hours having been spent in an immersive 3d environment take some time to adjust your lenses however and you ' ll discover a game that ' s both deep and almost endlessly entertainingin Terraria you are plopped into a randomly generated world your only task is to explore survive and thrive survival isn ' t even top of your " todo list " as the minor penalty of losing coins upon death is nothing more than a momentary setback for the most part the real driving force behind Terraria is its amorous advances of exploration drawing you in with suggestive displays of pots and vases in surfacelevel caves before luring you deeper with promises of heaving chests and rich oresthere is a wealth of fun to be had with this game but accessing it can be an insufferable challenge to start out without any solid tutorials ingame your left to wander the world clueless as to what to do the guide a starting npc can give you useful tips hereandthere but without any discernible goal to achieve it ' s hard to see the appeal at first building a shelter is a confusing chore crafting weapons an alien concept and survival at night is a daunting task plus once you ' ve mastered single player you can take your character online to tackle all the challenges the world has to offer with a few friends or simply start from scratch and carve a new adventure boss battles are certainly easier but nevertheless challenging for the small price to buy into this title you ' ll get more than your moneys worth in gameplay available to buy through steamnow if you ' ll excuse me i ' ve got some hellstone armour to craft a demon alter to find and an eater of worlds to slayscore by yourself 510with friends 8510"
Tf2,"Tf2 is a massively multiplayer game with lots of game modes to choose from and 9 unique classes to play teamwork is essential in this game and unlike many other games it has trade servers where you can trade items and acheivement idle servers this is by far one of the best free to play games on Tf2 there are many hats and weapons for you to acquire including strange weapons and killstreak weaponsthat was before the love and war update now in my opinion i think that there are way too many taunts in this game first there were a few and that didnt affect the game a lot but now in nearly every server someone has to be doing the conga taunt i like the conga taunt but when you use it most people will forget what the main purpose of this game is kill nevertheless i still love playing this game score 9510 too many random taunts in the game"
Csgo,"spent my childhood playing this game on my dads computer but it got corrupted and i lost my only copy of counterstrike source finally one day i found out about this amazing game and it changed my life 110 would reccommend is what i would like to say except the Csgo community is filled with people that think a sniper rifle which is designed for long distance combat is for quickscoping noobz and if you hardscope like youre meant to use a sniper rifle youre considered a noob people dont care about skill anymore and only care about the expensive skins for weapons you can get Csgo is now a digital gun camo collector 110"
Tf2,"team fortress 2 is not your typical first person shooter sure you can shoot people and blow them up but what sets this game apart from the typical fps is its creativity this game is not logical this game is not realistic but yet it does what its meant to do so well the game has nine classes to choose from offensive defensive and support each with different roles the scout for example must capture objectives and deal with his foes quickly while a heavy will draw attention and tank or a medic which will support objective based players or the tanky heavies there are also more unorthadox classes like the engineer which construct mechanical toys for their allies to use to their advantage one of the more unique classes the class everyone hates but everyone plays is the spy the spy can shapeshift into a member of the other team and sneak behind enemy lines and score an instakill backstab with their trusty knife they can also turn invisible and disable engineer machines the classes work in perfect harmony with each other with each class benifiting the team in a way the game is free to play but by no stretch is it pay to win everything you can pay for can be obtained by finding it in game or trading for it and the trading community is strong and well populated which makes it easy to trade skill is a more dominant factor as what use is the best gun in the game if a new player is using it this is where lots of free to play games fail but this is where team fortress 2 stands out to sum up Tf2 is a great game that involves heavy use of teamwork and the best bit is its free you can obtain the best items in the game without paying a dime which makes me give this game a910"

Metro_2033,"metro last light is a stunningly atmospheric and haunting firstperson shooter in which you play artyom the young man who saved humanity from the threat of the dark ones at the conclusion of Metro_2033 you must take up arms once more to save the metro from impending doom 1 this time however the threat is much closer to home at every turn you will be reminded of the desolation of the nuclear catastrophe that ended the world as we know it the ghosts of the dead the ruins of moscow and oncegreat landmarks like the kremlin and the dirty shambolic metro townships all elicit some measure of the despair and sadness that plagues what is left of humanity as they attempt to survive the grave new world their destruction has left behind the topnotch graphics and soundwork make the world extremely immersive and realistic the gameplay fits well with the atmosphere the game provides with scarce ammunition the bullet currency system deadly enemies and regular stealth sections all coming together to give the impression of bareknuckled survival the enemy ai is a bit lacklustre at times but this is only noticeable in a few cases it generally makes you feel very vulnerable and threatened at all times for a game made by a relatively small team of developers this is an awesome achievement also the soundtrack is just perfect910 do recommend"

Sanctum_2,"Sanctum_2 the game i almost boughtinteresting looking game that i had heard was very good so decided to try it out while it was free what i found was solid enjoyable gameplay and coop style playing that i rather enjoy and then i discovered it is nigh impossible to join a game it took around 2 hours for me to give up trying to join people via invite custom and quick searches the result turns this into a single player game which with some of the bigger harder enemies and turret option restrictions makes it into a no buy for me which is a pity as i did want to buy it but couldnt bring myself to buy a broken game"

Evolve,"now dont get me wrong i love this game a lot it started out as this ambitious little title that spawned from a simple mod in roblox of all things to now being a widely played charming game that gained numerous fans and a good community it has been great to follow along with the creator of the game and watch it Evolve into a poor mans dayz while maintaining a very good aspect of fun and survival but much to my and many other peoples dismay some recent updates to the game have been a little troubling what i am mainly talking about is the inclusion of new zombie types which is very reminiscent of special infected from left 4 dead now this is not a bad thing a bit of challenge and variety in the ways of enemies is great and very entertaining but that is where the good parts of the update end in my experience being a bambi on a new or even long played server is tough as the persistent threat of bandits and zombies is a constant looming hazard and without gear or teammates to aid you you are likely to die very quickly thankfully the zombies were easy to fight off and bandits were semieasy to avoid but with the inclusion of these dangerous new zombie types it has made things for bambis in particular and even gamesmart and geared players so much harder the mega zombie which is usually a zombie people avoid like the plague due to his incredible stength and close to one shot kills is now able to almost kill you instantly from a distance with a hunk of thrown concrete because apparently the mega zombie wasnt powerful enough then there is the fire zombie which when killed explodes in fire making melee combat near impossible spreads to other zombies which in turn makes them fire zombies also which means if there is a fire zombie in a horde and you kill it there will be a giant horde of fore zombies coming towards you next is the spitter zombie which shoots acid at you from a long distance and can kill you very quickly if you are in a gear menu and unawares to his presence lastly is the zombies that can turn invisible and can kill you extremely quickly because you cant see them at all even with the faint purple outline that doesnt help at all also there is the fast quadriped zombie but that can be killed quickly so it isnt as bad in conclusion unturned is an excellent game that i want to keep growing and getting better but it is currently being hindered by new zombie types that make the game so unnecassarily harder especially for fresh spawns maybe if some of these zombies were removed which i know is hard process or maybe nerfed to a reasonable level it would make the game just a little less difficult tldr the new zombies make the game too difficult and need a nerf or removal"

Terraria,"essentualy this game is like Terraria but it has a lot of differences making it scary and amazingly fun to play for the scary part try having a massive cute furry creature that looks harmless jump at your face and one hit you because usually the passive mobs actually are the scaryiest looking tenticale goops of goop that youve see another side note this games construction make you both sad and crazy for all the right reasons 1 youre going to make the coolest looking base then tt ditch it to make and even cooler one in a new sector 2 if youre the type to get agressive really fast dont try to tank mobs because death in this game is like paintball if youre hit your back to the start to try all over again have fun"

Besiege,"this war of mine is another game that has come out in recent times that is an absolute gem along with this and Besiege there are at least some games that are being made and developed that are utterly amazing this was my favourite game of 2014 and id recommend it to anyone even if this isnt your genre of game get it wait for a sale if you must i feel like this should be a game played by everyone at least once it will really show the horrors and mistakes that war brings couple flaws with it obviously such as replayability personally i like to set myself challenges now i know the grips of this game whenever i feel like playing it i think of something to do could be boring for some but i still find the game playable like my most recent challenge was to stay inside for as long as i could just buying and selling materials obviously didnt last very long as traders come in a blue moon but it was still interesting to watch foodwatersupplies begin to dwindle and the reactions i would give when traders eventually did show up then when they had nothing i neededas the trailer says there are things ive done in this game im not proud of and would like to think that its only a game that brings out such a side that steals from elderly because i needed food so badly but this game this experience is something that really does bring out human nature whatever choices you make just experience this little war of mine"
Tf2,"primal carnage cs Tf2 realistic dinosaurs"
Portal,"warning this review contains spoilers of the gameok this mod is brilliant whoever thought of this is genius the game mechanics of Portal are changed but nonetheless still have the same feel to it and although confusing at first you get used to themthe only things that really sucks about this game are three things1 theres this part where you have to deactivate some machines and stuff you have to go on an insane track of jumping and speeding and everything except my instincts told me to go to this little square in the wall but when it said to skip the section ahead i didnt read it properly and jumped it to it and the worst part is that it doesnt even skip it it plays someone playing it which was really lame i was really disappointed and i didnt want to play through the whole chapter again for that one bit2 like Portal almost no replay value3 the ending of the game is just really bad this new personality core called nigel who is likeable and funny has been hinted as evil and wants to kill you towards the end of the game but the ending is just a copy and paste of the original Portal youre on a platform descending into fire and because your paint gun was deactivated there was no way to avoid it the game even points out the loophole of you not needing to die and the last thing you hear is just nigel describing the rising temperature and then the credits roll this left a really bad taste in my mouth and it just felt the same but worse because at least in Portal theres a lot more even after you think the inevitable that really sucked and i didnt like the ending really and theres not even really any end in sight of the game it just sort of endsbut overall this game is worth the money its got a community workshop which is pretty cool granting lots of possibilites if youre a fan of Portal 2 youll like this gameprosgreat mechanicsgreat gameplaygood voice actingconsending isnt up to par with the rest of the gameno replay value reallyno real easter eggs of sorts810"
Garrys_Mod,"i love Garrys_Mod first up ive had some of the best times playing with friends on sandbox and trouble in terrorist town and murder and things like that there are infinite add ons and so much fun to be hadbut the multiplayer public servers are awful sometimesif you have no friends online and you dont feel like sandbox you can go on to multiplayer online to open servers to play tt murder prop hunt etc but the people on these servers are just awful most of the time what ive noticed is that theres a very limited selection of the types of people in Garrys_Mod either its the squealers that have the most annoying voices sometimes and say vulgar things or 18 year olds that sound like they have nothing to do with their lives im not saying all people are like this but its just how it usually is rdmers in tt are the worst who kill for no reason and another thing in tt is how people are suspicious of the littlest of things i can not recommend the multiplayer serversanother cheap sort of way to get money is to buy counterstrike source along with it thats another 15 on the 10 price tag and you like me may think i dont want to buy it and will probably wonder why it comes as a bundle see the thing is that in Garrys_Mod if you dont have the certain texture or addon for an item or map there will be huge red error signs and purple and black squares so you cant see the items and some of the neccesities for this game in terms of maps and textures come with counterstrike source and if you dont you have to go online and find all the textures and all the maps in a bundle open up your steam folder and dragging them in these packs take about half an hour to download and you need to download all the gamemodes excess maps and so many other things if you want to play online properly i mean come on at least give us a warning guys to me this seems like a ripoff if you didnt know and a cheap way of getting moneyoverall i really love Garrys_Mod but i love it the most when im playing with friends on a private match or by myself in sandbox if youre gon na buy it for online multiplayer i do not recommend it if youre going to buy it to play with friends and the occasional online multiplayer i fully recommend itprosfun gameplaygreat gamemodesa lot to do and downloadconsbad communitytextures and addons sometimesi will keep Garrys_Mod at a 710i know this is a very negative review but i just wanted to let you know the bad about gmod before you buy it"
The_Community,"this game is mildy enjoyable for the first few hours you play it during the first few hours youre matched with people in the low level group where things are fair and mostly even once you pass those few levels youll hit the biggest pay wall ive ever experience everyone you verse will have payed weapons you just cant compete with and amazing gear that makes your really bad weapons ever worsein the terms of match making the queue times are pretty short a minute or so to get in game youll be lucky to get into the medium connection speeds if youre not in the us and the majority of The_Community doesnt speak english anyway which is terrible for such a tactical shootertry it if you want but youll suffer under the might that is pay to win"

Sanctum_2,"Sanctum_2 successfully merges fps and tower defense games the multiplayer is fun the graphics are good and it is enjoyable to play enemy types vary and require different tactics to defeat making you plan your towers weapons and perks carefully i wouldve liked to see upgrading your primary and secondary weapons through the game and a selection of primary weapons for each class but it doesnt bug me too much the story is barely there with about two comiclike pictures before each level and besides the map and enemies gameplay doesnt change much between levels sure you get new towers secondary weapons and perks as you go along but i was hoping on each level that some flying spaceship thing would come and help the boss fights are really fun as the boss destroys your buildings and fuels your rage to destroy it without any expansions the story is short aswell but it does get hard and can take a bit of grinding the amount of detail put into each map is brilliant aswell with little bits to explore and objects to interact with overall this is a nice game to play with your friends by yourself and sometimes with random people over the internet unless they hop in on the last wave destroy all your towers before you notice and have time to act then leave 7510"

Loadout,"as far as f2p shooters go dirty bomb is possibly among the best out there highly recommended for people who want a good shooter to play for freethe features that set this above and apart all others are very fair pricing with minimal play time its possible to get a 500 credit hero permanently unlocked in 12 weeks if you play each game mode every day and win once you get 200 credits everyday and you can get 1500300 if you complete the objectives that cycle every 3 hours no change in power above bronze cards high skill requirements theres very little autoaim 1 turret class and a lot of hipfiring skill is required against snipers small hp mercs move fast and theres ample flanking paths tank classes are usually balanced by slow movement or needing medics and fire support characters to feed them massive focus on teamplay success is highly dependent on your team having a medic fire support engineer assault and recon at high levels youre going to need serious coordination between your team you can still carry despite the requirement for teamplay a good player is easily recognised in dirty bomb you may not win but youll make the other team pay hard with enough skill a medic could keep the entire team healed and push the opposition back varied heroes all mercs are functionally distinct and highly balanced each merc has specific Loadouts and skills that contribute to the game server browser wish other games had this negatives are matchmaking sometimes youre going to up against stacked teams Loadout system you have a fixed Loadout that others may not like as it forces them into a specific weapon augment they may not like fortunately bronzes are relatively cheap rng you can select the hero that you want to get a Loadout but the cheapest path requires rng special events also have a lot of rng involved however you can buy a bronze Loadout you want with ingame credits for 17500 credits minor glitches ive had a little rubber banding here and there high ping players seem to teleport around every now and then nothing major hackers relative to other f2p shooters though dirty bomb has a very low hacker problem that said its not like theres no cheaters ever"

Evolve,"this dino game t not sim dont expect a realistic game think battlefield to arma look out for saurian if that is your goal that aside this is a very enjoyable game the grind invovled in this game is immense with some dinos taking past ten hours to tame and things to grow can take hours this doesnt detract from the whole experience unless you lose hard earned dinos and parts of your base pvp servers are brutal with people attacking each other unprovoked so expect a harsh world the graphical quality of this game even on lowmediumhigh is immersive with the sounds of different dinosauria modders get to work on a full jurassic park overhaul please being distinct i would like some more ambient sounds like birds and trees rustling to make it like the launch trailer as they run towards the base the combat is very fun and keeps you on the edge of your seat dinosaur taming is very long and extremely difficult some requiring tranquilizers to keep them down the differnet climates of the zones are very different with snows being unforgiving and harsh me and my tribemate flew there on our hard earned pteranodons and threw up a ramshackle hut planning to set out on a direwolf hunting expediton the next day but getting ended up half frozen and thrown off a cliff while we were sleepingbut it is very good to get it at a reduced price and watch it Evolve into a monstrosity of dinosaurs and tribes waging war on a huge scale also be sure to check out the steam workshop the plethora of mods made by players add new items and even new dinos and new game modes so different play styles are encouraged"

Portal,"firstly id like to say that this game is very far up on my favourite games of all time alongside games of completely different genres such as fallout 2the setting for Portal is unclear immediately but you quickly become aware of the fact that you are a test subject for aperture labs whcih cements its place in the halflife universe guided by an omnipresent voice you make your way through the different chambers of increasingly difficult testsalthough this synopsis may make this game seem somewhat shallow it most certainly is not the main character chell although mute develops a personality regardless an attachment is created with this voice guiding you and most cryptically is the hidden areas in the chambers these give background into aperture laboratories the voice and possibly the sole survivorwhen compared to Portal 2 Portal does have some significant flaws this include a lack of characters and personality which although there isnt built upon until later in the game there arent as many testing mechanics in the original but this leads to much more creative test designes requiring ingenuity over resourcesoverall this game is amazing and you will fell dissapointed upon its completion Portal 2 builds upon the first and is a must after this is completed"
Portal,"best game ever made hands down only thing that comes close is the original Portal"

Terraria,"Terraria is the cool think to do"
Terraria,"okay so ive already praised this game and all its features but theres just been a massive update it has completely overhauled every detail of the game and it honestly does not have the same feel it is so much more awesome the matter manipulator is useful now combat is much more challenging and fun but most importantly it doesnt feel like Terraria 2 anymore this game was already unique enough as it was but now this could honestly be released as a full game right now and i wouldnt complain but these guys know why minecraft and Terraria did well i only have a few nitpicks like all ore is significantly rarer wtf are core fragments but i digress if you liked Terraria you are going to play this for ages it is accessible but can provide a pretty good challenge its good buy it"
Csgo,"counterstrike global offensive is another installment in the games series and is quite an amazing game really i only got to get this game through steam sales and the normal price tag of the game will explain the seemingly unreasonable prices for good weapon skins on steam marketanyway about this counterstrike game it is a great fps for a comparably cheaper price than other wellknown ones and provides a good player base for people from australia to play i am only mentioning aust but its a wide spread game and playing with friends is actually fun the ranking system i guess is adequate but sometimes a little offthemark sometimes the system pairs you up with really high ranked people leaving you behind in the scoreboard i understand that when moving up from silver to nova makes u verse novas but sometimes its a little unfairall in all Csgo is a great game not just to play by yourself get your friends on this d its an amazing game by valve"

Tf2,"i wake up in the morning about six amand play some Tf2"
Super_Meat_Boy,"this game is wonderfulits quite a shocker once you get into it though an introduction that sets you up for a lovely light puzzle platformer with some exploration and light atmosphere suddenly hits you with what could be mistakes for an action platformer ala Super_Meat_Boy the controls here are slick and the game always makes sure that you have all the materials requiredand god this game is beautiful absolutely stunningdo i recommend this game you bet i do"
Tf2,"my good Tf2 game"
Team_Fortress_2,"ive never been particularly fond of multiplayer shooters from my limited experience they have this intial rush that feels pretty good but that feeling slowly fades to leave behind a bleak and dry experience they just seem to lack the engaging elements that singleplayer games have and use so wellthats not the case with Team_Fortress_2 though this game is fun not only is the gameplay deep intuitive and interesting but it also accentuates the style and the style accentuates it the characters are surprisingly fleshed out and i would recommend reading some of the comicsoverall give it a go"

Csgo,"have you ever secretly had a lust to be bummed in your sleep by a weeaboo who has way more time to invest in a video game then you well look no further the amount of times you will be absolutely pood on by some 12 year old whos mum is an alcoholic and doesnt care about what time he stays up to as long as the little turd isnt in her hair and then wake up the next morning on the beach in rust after you just started to get your base off the ground is insane sometimes i consider uninstalling the game but you sometimes get these temporary lapses of wanting to have fun this is of couse ruined by the various collection of weeaboos neckbeards and no lifers of the like who invest way to much time in the video games then at school work or other various necessities of society the game is good the fun is definitely had but if someone spends more time on this game then you chances are you are screwed also the shooting mechanics are so sloppy honestly the cheap Csgo recoil rip off causes guns to miss most bullets not register and sometimes causes my stools to harden and therefore causes them trouble in dropping from the depths of my buttocks you have to buy this game basically but you will have a very strong love hate relationship with it oh and play with friends otherwise the chances of you quitting are at least 900"

Loadout,"this is by far way more enjoyable than most other first person shooters that are out there currently by my standards atleastsadly i originally downloaded this game because i saw star play it and i thought it looked pretty decent i played this game for around half an hour and immediatly fell in love with it the mechanics are great they feel so smooth and so right even though it does take a while to play through games and get points to buy other guns it dosnt matter the starting Loadout is perfect for learning the mechanics and slaugtering people and when you do finally earn enough points or gp to buy your first gun its so pleasing i was getting wrecked for so long but then i figured out how to use the hrv which lets you see through walls and then i finally picked up my game and started to enjoy the game a lot more just the simple easy things like that change it a lot i dont have that many hours on blacklight retribution but its one of the best games i have ever encountered on steamand best of all its free"

Dota_2,"much better then league of legendsthis is coming from someone who played RIRE since beta up until 6 months agoDota_2 shines above other games in the genre for these reasons1 hero versatility2 learning curve is steeper but more rewarding3 games snowball less but if they do its for the right reasons4 games are less likely to be decided early therefore there is always plenty of time for a comebackoverall the game is much more rewarding for someone who is starting out in this genre highly recommended"

Dota_2,"Dota_2 is a game where your goal is to destroy the enemies ancient while defending your own however Dota_2 is much more complex than it seems you must farm getting gold by killing things called creeps then you must push attacking towers on any of the lanes and then you must fight in team fights to win Dota_2 is extremely addictive so make sure you have an open schedule because you wont be able to stop playing while Dota_2 is fun it is also very difficult and hard to master but the more you play the better you will get overall i reccomend for anyone to have a go at Dota_2 if you dont enjoy it then move on to a different game have fun"

The_Community,"this game is amazing it is so much fun know that u can get items faster but the only problem i have with this game is that when your in a battle adn your game freezes and no ones moving to only thing u can do is exit out of the game but then when you go back into the a multiplayer game it says you have to wait 2 minutes when it wasnt your fault the internet crashed and veryone throse so know you are waisting your day trying to get into a server but ather then that problem the game is super amazing with all the cool robots people make The_Community is great what i dont get is that you have to be 13 to play the game when you cant swear so the game has miner issues other than that the game is greati would rate this game 610 jsut becuase of all the problems with the servers and the age i know iam being harsh on a game that is early access but still hopefully they fix dat problem drgames youtube"

The_Community,"this is a great game for younger gamers its basically a minecraft dayz mixed game but more of dayz but less bugs than dayz its quite hard to believe that a 16 year old named nelson sexton made this game all by himself and so far ive got over 100 hrs in game and im loving it its got simple graphics but it makes up for it because it gives you a chance to feel a ive got to survive this feeling and thats what i love about these games although there arent many aussie servers that are 247 online its still got great potenicial and i think nelson could potencially make the game even greater than what it already is and if he chooses to let The_Community do the features when 30 comes out with the workshop modding api maybe itd get more purchases for gold but i think if you buy gold its not just about the features but actually that your supporting the development and pushing the game along so it can be what The_Community wantsthe survival featuresyou can basically run around a town and find a melee weapon anywhere but when you find a gun you know youve got to save the ammo and dont be a complete idiot and shoot in a town full of zombies and make them chase after you and when you run out of ammo youve got to quickly equip a melee weapon and thats fun as ive died like over a million times by doing that and the experienceskills are great but i guess their could be more unqiue skills but when i got all the skills i was partying with chemlights until a zombie came and killed me because i put my weapons in my chest and that was the end of my skills well not exactly the end of them they give you back half of your skills but when youve got like 3 levels of one skill once you die youll get 1 level in that skill back over all the survival features are awesomethe crafting featuresthe crafting is a little hard to get used to so you may have to google the recipes up like i did a thousand times and the great thing about it is that you can refill your bullets so if you found a gun in a town then itd be a civillian gun so you can use civillian bullets to refill it but i was confused when i had a swift mag because when i click on it the desc says its a military grade mag but i cant use military bullets to refill it thats because you need civil bullets because its found in civillian areas aswell as military but when you create a house you can bascially start putting some skills in crafting and outdoors if you have crafting level one you can craft a crate that doesnt lock so anyone can open it and steal stuff but also with level 1 crafting you can make some stone crafting recipes when you have level 2 crafting aka max crafting you can craft either a chest which is locked and has 6 slots and the metal locker that has the same 4 slots but i guess is harder to break with a sledge hammer and other melee weapons also with crafting level 2 you can make metal building materials which the person who placed it is the only one who can open or close it you can also craft other stuff out of cloth and gear like attachments and etc but overall it would be really good if the person who placed the building material could actually pick it up if they placed it in the wrong spot or just simply want to movei love this game and i would seriously recommend buying a permenant gold upgrade although i havent done it yet im going to so i can support nelson and i rate it 1210 d best of luck to nelson sexton to making 30 possible"

Tf2,"this game is more broken than payday 2 dlcs its heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ier than Tf2s fps at least with Tf2 i can get past the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing titlescreenedit we did it boys i made it past the title screenedit 2 after playing for a while now that it works i still cant recommend buying it aside from the fact that its locked at 30 fps its boring compared to the other grindy nonspinoff versions of the game so farwell if youre a die hard neptunia fan then i guess buying it wouldnt be so bad who knows maybe my opinion will change"
Evolve,"take this review with a grain of saltbefore i go through this review please note that this game is not for everyone alright lets beginstorythe story was somewhat predictable yet still good it rEvolves around the main protagonist neptune who has lost her memory and slowly brings the main cast together who at first hate each other but later on become friends they then band together to fight an evil person thretening to destroy the world relatively clicheone thing youll pick up straightaway is the reference to other games and anime oh god the references also theres fanservice gameplaythe gameplay in my opinion was solid you dont need to excessively grind so long as you know what youre doing and not avoid every monster strategic placement of your characters is a necessity for victory in the later stages great thing is exp is shared with your entire party for example if you gain 500 exp from a battle everyone gets 500 exp unlike some games which only give the most based on who does what this significantly speeds up the levelling process there is also the remake system which ill go into further detail afterremake systemalright so basically when this game got remade from the original they changed the storyline up a little and added this new feature called the remake system basicaly what it allows you to do is add new dungeons enemies for those dungeons you can change the item pick ups make new accessories and just create a load of stuff great addition to add variety to the gamenew gameone important feature of this game is new game once youve finished the game you can redo the game again and go for a second cycle this is necessary to get all the added cpu candidates which you can create via the remake system the good thing is all your credits experience levels and items get rolled over so you cna go for the achievements that you may have missed in the first run the bad thing is that enemies dont get stronger at all so if youre a high enough level you have no challenge at all aside from the colosseumdlcplease note that dlc is not necessary to get all achievements so its not a forced buythe dlc allows you to unlock 3 new charactershistiorepeachyplutiaand the additional packs give you 300 levels per pack and added dungeons and colosseum battles so you can go back and have more funall in all you get 3 characters 900 additional levels and new dungeons if you decide to purchase every dlcso to sum upif youre an anime fan like RIRE protagonists and have some money to throw at a screen this is the game for you as far as im concerned its worth the money and time that i invested in it and i dont regret one bit of itprosremake systemno endless grindinglots of charactersgood varietygood gameplayfanservicenice variety of personalitiesgood parodiesgreat soundtrackconsstory lacks twists and can be cliche at timescharacter voices can sometimes be irritating to listen tohard boss fights if you dont grind levels at early stagesdifficulty curve on some parts are too extreme9510once again it is not for everyone but i highly recommend this game also this is much better than the original so dont bother trying the original and go straight for the remake"

Portal,"overall i quite liked most of it and recommend it its free anywaythe timetravel mechanic is very nicely executed and a lot of fun to figure outfrom the start of the game i found myself having a lot of fun with it having it there adds a new very interesting mechanic that really puzzles the brain like very few Portal mods can really achievehowever this game suffers from a lot of very common problems that plague Portal 2 mods and mapsthe maps are needlessly huuge in a lot of areas you just walk and walk merely to push a button and then you have to backtrack it does get a little pedantic especially once youve figured out what youre supposed to do a lot of it is to make way for the custom storythis is made worse by the fact there is hardly any surfaces you can actually place a Portal on in fact some whole levels see you never even using the Portal gun so a lot of walkingthe game seemed to quickly drop logical challenges and veer towards timingacrobatic puzzles which i personally hate this seems to apply to the jump on your clone and get launched in the air mechanic where sometimes you get stuck in her headbut none of these happen in the early levels so you can simply download it fire it up and play it as long as you enjoy itand of course some people likely enjoy some of the above mechanics or dont mind them"

Csgo,"counterstrike is just one of those games that lives on in the world of gaming and few equal its prestige in competitive gameplay and esports global offensive is the best edition so far and despite using the same maps again and again it dosent seem to get old new people trial and error of past play and the situation thats right in front of you changes the game for you despite it being a map youve played over and over again the fact that you only get one life just makes you jumpy and worried about what could be around ever corner which is a good thing as you respet the one life your given and try your best as you would in real life not to lose itmore often then not you play with good people who dont bag you out just becuase you miss a shot or make a mistake however just like any other gaming community you do have people who hack troll and are just plain salty sometimes but when you play online you take those risks the gun skins just add a extra feel to the game of making each gun your own with added stickers but it hurts even more when your shot by your own gun the keys mite be a little more expensive then what youll get mostly but i like that at least you have that option you know if you have money to spare watching pro matches on live streams while depressing that you may never be that god like its amazing to see what some people can manage to pull off in this game and gives you some ideas you could try in your gameplaylots of servers and a active community Csgo is a game you must play at least once"

Nether,"this is a very good game but i have two very major gripes with itfirst is that there are no australian servers this can be slightly excusable but i like to know that my country exists to other people one or two servers based in somewhere like adelaid or sydney would be great this is frustrating because that means that your austrailian market is required to join the asian servers that have over 150ms of ping thats 1 second too many you have already died by the time youve realised youve been shot australians are really at a disadvantage because of thissecond are the random and rather critical flaws and bugs i know that this will eventually be fixed with development but that does not fix their current presence in the game they can range from small things like your character stuck moving forward for a time which can be fatal in a fight or range from big things like your character randomly suffering from a terminal cardiac arrest and promptly dying losing all of your gear and progress as ive said this problem will eventually be fixed with development but they still exist todaydespite all this i highly reccommend this game because of the amount of times i have become stressed angry annoyed and felt truly alone while playing it these are all very good things because that is what the game is focused on survival by any means in a cruel hard and desolate environment i cant count the amount of times ive raged at another player because he took my stuff after giving my brain a new ventilation hole or have felt the heart thudding adreniline of escaping from mortal peril or coming down from a euforic high after destroying several different types of Nether then being shot by another playerits good fun if you are looking for an rpgish guns guts and glory postapocolyptic survival game where anything goesone thing ive noticed is that no matter your level or how good you think you are in this game someone can still best you if they have just started out if they are smart its an even playing field with some barricades optional be warned and have fun"

The_Community,"new update so after four months the game finally got an update all it took was the game being pulled from sale on steam seems very suspicious as The_Community was in uproar for months with no word from the dev jig then within two weeks of the game getting pulled from sale we suddenly get an updateas for the content one new dinosaur which was already in the game files and unlocked by modders months ago stampedes which consist of 30 dinosaurs running around eachother in circles instead of the normal one or two a trap mechanic which is poorly implemented and a couple of value changes i doubt the dev spent more than a couple hours on itid hold out on any purchase of this game untill we get a steady steam of updates and a promise from the dev that they arnt going to just dissapear as soon as the money starts coming back in the game has potential but i honestly dont know if the dev has the ability to finish itupdateits now been over two months there have been 0 updates in that time no ones heard anything from the devs and it turns out that the pr manager governor ostrich was a freelancer whos contract expired may 31st no updates no word from devs stay clear"
The_Community,"huge open world loads of stuff to build considering its only been out a few days decent graphics much less lag than before they patched it ignore the negative reviews by people that dont understand what an early access is these are honestly some of the nicest devs ive seen and they will work their asses off to make sure this game gets better and better have a look in The_Community forum and ask em a question if you want the fact that theyll answer it is an absolute breath of fresh air compared to some devs and your response will come way quicker than youd expect"
Well_There,"summary - prostfun gameplay and tight controlstgreat atmosphere music visuals and storytdoesn ' t outstay its welcomeconstsome dodgy sound effectstfrustrating at timestbalance issuesscore - 710short fun and cheap worth picking up dextended reviewhalo spartan assault is a fun and short game it took me just over 3 hours to complete the campaign and most of the time i was enjoying myself the controls are great for a pc port the graphics are good considering this is a pc port there are all the basic video settings but i often encountered a bug where upon tabbing out the game would exit full screen and enter a small window and i was unable to revert back to full screen without relaunching the game a small hindrance due to the short levels but it does get annoying on to the actual gameplay and atmosphere now the gameplay is fun and rather simple top down shooter with a few objectives to complete over a 38 minute long level there are a variety of objectives that never overstay their welcome or reoccur too often there also additional challenges in the form of both assault ops and weekly challenges spartan assault rewards kills with a simple points system points are rewarded per kill and vary in quantity for what you kill medals can also be earned through killing enemies in a certain way the same as medals in other halo games depending on the amount of points earned during a mission xp is rewarded after the game to purchase additional weapons armour abilities and boosters for damage shield regen and points for a single mission skulls difficulty modifiers can be applied to earn more xp there is a great selection of enemies vehicles weaponry and gadgets at your disposal enemies react well and behave as you would expect from a halo game there are a large selection of enemies that you encounter ranging from meek grunts to tough and aggressive brute chieftains vehicles look very good in spartan assault but some tanks and wraiths suffer from some clunky controls all weapons feel effective but could use a little spruce up in the sound department and some balancing most gadgets are useful one way or another but there are a few that dont seem to have much use at all the energy shield is very hard to position and provides minimal cover along with slogging you down on the other hand the stun aoe is brilliantly effective if not a little op overall combat feels good but could use some balancing and punchier sound designthe graphics and textures are impressive for a port they look detailed smooth and move very fluidly some environments feel a little bland but this can be ignored by the vast majority of exciting and wild landscapes that capture both the beauty and wartorn horror of the halo universe the cut scenes are brilliant the moving comic art style that halo fans may be familiar with has returned and has never looked better it is simply put the animation of an art piece the story that accompanies these cut scenes is easy to follow but interesting nonetheless the main story is told through cut scenes but additional story can be found in the mission briefing the music of spartan assault is also amazing it perfectly captures the spirit of previous halo titles and mixes in some new sounds as Well_There is a piece of music for every mood in spartan ops and every piece is amazing the overall atmosphere is dark but enthralling and debatably the best part of spartan assault there are 6 campaign chapters with 5 levels per chapter amounting to 30 short levels playing through these levels i rarely died but the points that i did die at i died repeatedly this caused quite a bit of frustration for me but after investing my xp into additional weapons and ' power ups ' i managed to surpass them by the end of my time with spartan assault i felt that dropping 5 on a short enjoyable title like this was well worth my money overall i feel that the game is absolutely worth picking up if you ' re a fan of the halo universe or just looking for a short but enjoyable game710"

The_Community,"great game hands down one of the best indie releases of the year insurgency is a fast paced realistic shooter an odd blend that the devs have made work oh so well the maps are well designed a small array weapons and attachments but all are functional and server puprose a unique weight system so those with heavy armour a m249 and chest carrier will run much slower then someone with a mp5k and a chest carrier this system allows for a varity of play styles would you rather be able to take an extra bullet while suppressing the enemy or have a small arms weapon flank around and kill everyone the game also immensely rewards objective based players by creating situations where you are the last surviving player on your team and the only way to respawn your team is to cap the objective its moments like that which create the intensity of this game graphical insurgency isnt as flashy as say crysis or battlefield but it runs smooth on an i5 750 lynfield stock and a gtx 650 2gb gddr5 im able to run the game almost maxed at a solid 60 frames per second the game is even playble on a mac according to my sources with all this said though the best thing about the game is The_Community if you go through the workshop of insurgency you will find a ton of custom gun models reskins sounds and so much more but its not just the workshop content creators that make the game its also the players yes the workshop content creators are players to ive never had a bad time with a player on insurgency most people with mics use it for tactical advantage rather then playing some really annoying music and The_Community is generally pretty forgiving to unless you go on a murderous rampage on your own teamall in all insurgency is a great game for a great price whether you pay the full 15 or pick it on sale its well worth it"

Starbound,"Starbounds history Starbound is a game that is hated and loved by its community at the moment the devs are very active towards posting stuff on their Starbound website i fully understand people ' s frustration with the dev ' s chucklefish and how they shaped the game the game has gone through many updates that remove core mechanics and add new mechanics altogether the where slowing down their goal to finish the game by changing what they had already built and not focusing on what to do next with the players experience " they were just fixing stuff that did not need fixing " at the start of Starbounds early access release i bought four copies for my mates so that we could all play on my local server we had tones of fun exploiting bosses and endlessly reading throughout the wiki for answers we finished the game when we hit the max rank tier from there i played again i started experimenting on how long the game was if you only cared about getting the highest tier armour set but the game had exciting news " nightly build " i knew that the nightly build would delete my character so i saved him but when i entered the nightlyunstable build i saw what the dev ' s opinions were on their old stable build they wanted to remake the tiers they wanted to remake how you got through the game by adding quests and overall they were controlling how you levelled through the game and scraping their old work which increased development time but they added a huge improvement to the rest of the game weather weapons etcStarbound now has a better story and realism to what your character is doing but you don ' t get the feeling of playing like you used in the old build the game itself Starbound starts off with you choosing your character after you have chosen you character and spent ten minutes customizing himher to be perfect you end up in your ship which is broken and ruined you are then forced to go to the planet below and mine resources to fix your ship you continue through the story crafting tiers of crafting tables to get the " next best thing " and completing quests throughout your adventure you will kill unique bosses and listen to startbounds fantastic soundtrack conclusion i would suggest you to look at the games state current build and community and think is this game for metdo i like adventure through space and finding better weapons and resourcestdo i like following quests and helping npcs be lazytdo i like pimping my house so i can show off to my friendshttpswwyoutubecomwatchv4sz2zr3pzeothis video is about the recent winter unstable update"

Super_Meat_Boy,"ori and the blind forest looks like a simple platformer with similiarities to the new rayman games and Super_Meat_Boy i can assure you that while those accusations are true that is not a bad thing as it takes the best parts of both worlds and slams it together with a few new mechanics introduced frequently that keep the game fresh and excitingori features a few new ideas including a skill tree in a platformer say what and parkour features like bash the skill tree offers alot of variety as in to what style you will play the game whether you want to have offence guidance or utility bash is one of my favourite mechanics as it makes very interesting puzzles fights and parkour the only thing original ill rat on is the boring combat system i just feel like they couldve done at least aiming rather than a boring autolock attack they tried to spice it up by adding the charge bomb but i feel that it just kind of serves a purpose in the outside map not in combat the visuals are astounding i swear if you are not playing it on max qualities its a sin every part of the game looks fantastic from the haunting mysterious misty woods to the enchantingly beautiful thornfelt swamp every part is an asset and a wonderful sight to see animation and effects look great too the main characters animations are a stand point from graceful ori to the slumpy naru and the scale and fright emitting from kuro attacks are bright and colourful which interact with the light of the background i cant live with out mentioning the soundtrack which has vocals that bring the tunes out of the game and into real life with you whistling at the grocery shop they all represent the moment they play in and add to the games already astounding atmospherein summary id say the ori and the blind forest is a bright and colourful rayman Super_Meat_Boy game with intriguing story mechanics music and gameplay i think the only negatives of the game would be the slightly under welming combat its a bit short and some difficulty spikes but i find that like in Super_Meat_Boy this make it way more rewarding when you accomplish a difficult challengeoverall rating 96 a must have for platformer enthusiastsplease make a sequel moon studios"
Dishonored,"a very unique game with a steampunkor whalepunk more sovibe so itfeaturing varied ways of combat and traversing levels from running atop victorianesque houses to skulking below guards in dingy sewers with them none the wiserthe gameplay benefits from a varied range of powers at your dispoal such as blinka power making you capable of swiftly teleporting forth to traverse the envrioment or swiftly dispatch a guard with a sneaky neck slicethe real star of the game is the stealth aspect though lacking in some aspectsnonlethal options such as weapons are generally lackingthere are so many ways to go about the levels as each area is multileveled with plenty of dilapidated houses which hint at a life gone pastthe only real letdown is the story that is somewhat genericyoure the meperess guard that gets framed for her murderhence the title Dishonoredyou then must go and clear your name which involves dealing which various people of importance which opens up the questionwill you decapitate them in a bloody display of utter brutality or will you dispatch them with a well thought out nonlethal waythe length of the game is about 114 hours depending on if you choose to be a ghost unseen by the enemy or a menacing murdererthe latter usually cuts the game down to about 68 hoursi spent around 40 hours on the game as i played it on xbox 360 first and did a nonlethallethal and ghostno detection or kills playthroughi would highly recommend the game as its a gem in an endless sea of generic fps and mmosespecially if your a fan of deus ex and bioshock"
Dishonored,"like Dishonored with cockrings"
Csgo,"Csgo has the potential to be a great game but that potential is squandered by developers that introduce changes based on their whims and iterate on those aimless changes based on statistics from the least skillful players the core gameplay mechanics have been trending in the wrong direction for some time and the most recent update is the proverbial straw that broke the camels back its remarkable and disappointing that the current stewards of this franchise dont understandappreciatecare what makes it special in the first place"
Dota_2,"this game has extreme potential once australian servers are released and the characters have been balanced i see this game having a bright future however it would seem as though crafting will allow for pay to win the micro transactions within this game are its only current downfall id reccomend the developer take a good long hard look at their current monetary scheme and rehaul it something like RIRE purchase system or maybe like Dota_2s set buying system chest unlockables and so on regardless as i said with proper balancing and a dedicated team this game could easily become a great moba 910"

Portal,"potato 2 is a great puzzle game becides a rubix cube it includes a great story line afler 99i dont know how many 9s years later when aperture beep now back to the review Portal throws you into many ovals and pits but wheatley is a beep to you and melps ever so slightly along the way after all a good game but 1 thing the biggest feature to potato 2 is the coop feature 1 word it dosent work"
Csgo,"Csgo is a fun tactical shooter or non tacticaldepending on your play style the graphics are well done but not too overboard like cod or bf so you can run it on a potato the mainproblen with the game is that bloody cooldown system whats it for easy to catch on to but hard to master"
Metro_2033,"such an amazing game especially when playing on ranger hardcore difficulty really gives you a glimpse of the hardships and shortage on supplies and ammo people would go through under such circumstances like an apocalypse the story is great and the fact that to get a good ending relies on more than just simple choices really makes this game try it out guys and play its predecessor Metro_2033 first"
Evolve,"they screwed up big time a great concept at first but completely poorly handeled the membership system is akin to bribary in the armed forced ie quick promotions the game offers huge battles alright but they are like mindless headless chickens running around it all dEvolves to a gigantic clusterf of tanks and other vehicle oh and if you think air support will help you better heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit hope that the aircraft are flow by experts since newbs will be shot down faster than a cheetah in a bullet train straped to a rocket as a new player you will die constantly since you have no heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit idea where anything is and who is shooting at who the facilities feel half heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit as they only contain generic buildings that are copy and pasted all over the map and cover goes from all over the god damn place to virtually nonexistant i hope you have a supercomputer and instantaious internet because if you do not you are stuffed you will die due to frameskip and lag weapons require real money to buy and is more expensive than a real life gun and you can get it with ingame currency but it will feel like it takes forever if you can handle all the annying things in this game then it will be worth it as there are genuinely fun moments in this game like doing air drops into enemy bases or ambushing a enemy convoy all in all the game could be great but the paying aspect of it feels broken and it breaks the game balance could be done much better and more tactical facilities instead of open plains great for zerging makes this game a pain to play"
Portal,"actualy a pretty nice minimalist puzzler a la Portal and qube its smooth with nice music although the music transition isnt great dont expect a story because there is none although after youve beaten it you realise that there was actually a goal for all thisits a fun simple minimalist puzzler that makes no big promises and yet is pretty fun for the short playtime its made by 1 guy and its free dont listen to all the crappy negative comments just enjoy it"

The_Community,"i first started playing this mmorpg back in 2008 when it was first released and sure the graphics werent so good back then but The_Community was great even though it lacked in some areas but made up for in others the class system aka job was clean cut and clear as how to where to do this and that there are plenty of party quest and hard dungeons that make a party important each class compliments each other customizable races are also pretty fun to muck around with at the beginning like making little sprites have big ti ahem moving on the game provides many challenges to take on which can take you on adventures from one to place to another last but not least how could i forget the pet system the pets are absolutlely adorable though the down side is that they take like a million years to level up but when you do manage to hit level 61 for the pet and mount it i guess it sort of makes it worth while having an amazing pet honestly when this game shut down i really thought this was the end for such an amazing game there were plenty fo bugs to be fixed but it was still great none the less but to be rereleased and to be on steam its like a dream come true"
Csgo,"with all this microtransition crap going on people are over reacting have you tried using an ak a car4 both of vanilla guns and still good and if you have got the big bank dlc you can use the eagle rifle which is really good imho the introduction of the safes and drills is just a poke at Csgo i wouldnt be surprised if Csgo realeses something to do with payday 2 soon so like to say i see what your doing there honestly the skins only give a bonus if you get the statboost variant everyone needs to stop acting like babies crying over something that you can now grind for drills and safes through cardsalso you have to realise that the only game that overkill is making money off right now is payday 2 unless you want them to go bankrupt because you dont like your overpowered guns not killing greens in oneshot in overkill means your kinda of selfish wait a bit by the start of next year this whole thing would of blown over and people would stop caring"

The_Community,"got some real annoying bugs like when i first alttab back into it it goes into steam community shifttab when i go to run just recently died cause when i bailed out of my car since it was almost destroyed plowing through a horde tried to call in backup before getting mauled but since i pulled up the menu midrun it didnt work and just kept spamming me with the menu whenever i tried to change direction The_Communityside missions are repetitive and are almost too frequent to do the main missions with unless you ignore it and let the people get unhappy since they arent getting helpare getting lost also ive had a few zombies while jumping fences land inside the walls of buildings that they were previously outside and cars flip from pebbles on the road usually right beside a horde also the map system is horrid by todays standard but maybe im just being a wuss expecting it to actually show a route to where i put a waypoint but it saves having to keep checking the map which doesnt pause the gameother than that the engine is pretty good apart from previous stated bugsglitches that have occured the fact that you can change out to almost any character to keep your health up drugs for keeping it up in the field and designate where and what buildings you want in your base aswell as where the base is and set up outposts driving is rather easy but i hate hatchbacks too weak seems like a step up from project zomboid but when projzomb gets things like survivors and hopefully a better server browsing system the tables might turn"
Garrys_Mod,"space engineersi guess it is sorta like a cross between minecrafts building style and creativity Garrys_Mod because of the physics simulation and space because well you know its space even if you dont really like minecraft or gmod this is still brilliant just to smash stuff into other stuff even the main menus background is just people making stuff crash into each other on purpose i would even recommend you buy it just for the smashingthis game will work even on old computers to some extent of course as well as on topnotch ones i just reallised ive used minecraft as an example and then topnotch what a coincidence but if you are experiencing lag well at least enough to make it anoying there are only to ways easy ways to fix it hopefully both are found in the graphics section of the options but you may find an annoying problem one of them does hardly anything performance wise at least i think so maybe i just dont notice and the other will decrease the quality of the entire screen and just incase youre wondering no i dont mean permanently just how the game will be displayed on the screen which has a much more noticable improvement to performance but know this performance in space engineers all and i mean all depends on what it has to simulate it may be seem fine when you are just building a very simple structure but when you have some small spacecraft inside the hanger of a huge mothership and then fly it straight into an asteroid at full speed even the best commercially available computers can have a hard time surviving all those computations going on at once what is the result a game that is great awesome really realistic but can also be extremely cpu intensivebut overall it is still great even if it does run a bit slowly whether or not this is sarcasm doesnt really matter both work good here it is worth the money and the lag if any of course as this varies depending on the circumstances it is brilliantand just for the sake of it live long and prosper spock"

Evolve,"if god did not exist it would be necessary to invent him judging by the fact that you are reading this you have most likely glanced at the game of which this review is about and you may have noticed the fact the title is partnered with the ostentatious declaration of game of the year edition one of my biggest problems with this game is that it does not deserve such a title a more appropriate accolade would probably have to simply be deus ex game of century editionyes thats right i found a game thats better than halflife 2 deal with it 2012 methis is the part where one usually describes what the game is and a bit about the gameplay but deus ex has an exception but as a rule of thumb most people classify it under the simple and undeserving title of fps a name unworthy of such a masterpiece this is due to the seamless blend of rpg elements stealth and of course first person gameplay of the shooting variety and no fallout 3 is not a better example because bethesda never quite grasped what the words roleplaying mean and give out skill points in as plentiful quantities as the loading time in their games due to the excessive consolization that plagues this industry like the grey death of course the game is much more complex than this as you are not necessarily limited to sneaking around urban dystopia and secret laboratories one can simply go in guns blazing but this usually results in immediate death or in contrast can complete the entire game without killing a single person whatsoever the amount of choice and the way it reacts to your decisions is frightenly highbut nothing is perfect the gunplay is fairly weak and the graphics and animations are fairly dodgy due to it running of the already fairly dated unreal engine the levels whilst very expansive and well designed are a bit boxy and bland even within the context of a ruined 2052 cyberpunk setting its true strength however lies within its story without spoiling too much it rEvolves around the player a nanoaugmented agent dont worry it is kind of explained ingame called jc denton who works for unatco united nations antiterrorist coalition a group formed by the united nations in response to increasing global tensions including a terrorist strike on the statue of liberty the game was made in 200 so it was still perfectly fine to discuss terrorist attacks on new york but as the player fights the various organizations he starts to realise there is something very wrong with his overlords and finds himself a player in a secret war for world dominance the themes factions and events in the game are likely from a conspiracy theorists nutty dream but simply keeping up to date wiht the state of the world simply provides foreshadowing for the dystopia presented in this game whilst most of the exposition and dialogue is extremely well written its delivery and voice acting is not as refined simply watch any play through of hong kong or paris to get the idea but i suppose there is some charm to hearing asian triads debate about philosophy in silly accentson the subject of sound it is quite obvious that the music does an excellent job of making up for the questionable voice acting when you first boot up a game and simply get chills from the title screen you know youve got a gem in your hands all the the levels have an apprpaite soundtrack that suits them with seperate themes for ambient combat conversations and death ah hong kong never again will i be able to go anywhere remotely asian without feeling like stepping into wan chai market for the first timemy final word is that you should absolutely buy this game it is very cheap 174 in a sale and there is simply no excuse for not playing this there is a wellknown phrase that every time you mention deus ex someone will reinstall it but this is complete bullocks because no one in their right mind would ever uninstall it it is the best 700mb on their hard drive the point being this is easily the best pc game if not the best overall game ever made it is really quite sad how no game has ever been able to match it after 14 years in terms of complexity and competencywhat a shame"

The_Community,"RIRE oh man this is a game i will always remember you want a short review on this game alrighty i should be able to give you one ive played this game plenty just not on steamgranted ive not played this game in quite some time but there is one thing you must understand elite moderaters they are either going to be your best friend or theyll be some punk two year old that is crying over the fact that you son of a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit youre using a damn shotgun gtfo with the message of youve been kicked out of the match by the elite moderater the game has a bit of a history with hackers i dont know if theyve fixed that but for some time elite mods were nexons way to deal with it most of The_Community however if you were in a normal game lobby dispised the hacker as much as you did and wouldnt hesitate to vote kick his heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out"

Garrys_Mod,"yes another pros and cons list but here are my honest opinions about Garrys_Mod reminder these are my pros and cons not yours pros unique sandbox experience able to download a series of addons from other games able to construct and destroy almost anything highly addictive gameplay highly available workshop in which is open to many choices several gamemodes to choose from via workshop and ingame more than enough weapons ragdolls npcs vehicles effects maps and much more to enjoy playing around with able to make upload and send many community creations such as videos addons screenshots duplications made from addons or ingame built objects and saves cons poorly optimised crashes oftenly depending how many addons you have addons easily conflict with over content chunkyslow loading again depending on how many addons you have saves can easily corruptscrew up depending if youre on the verge of getting a ton of updates from the workshop due to outdated addons is the game worth the money yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes enough said"
Team_Fortress_2,"Team_Fortress_2 is indeed nothing more than a masterpiece most of the time its a massacre full of fun from its unique gameplay containing 9 suitable mercenaries which are the scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and spy now of course each seperate class plays a different role making Team_Fortress_2 truly one of the most fascinating of all fps gamesnow yes indeed this is another rant about a whole different aspect of the game Team_Fortress_2 shares relation between trading and gifting the economy includes items from cool to insane which there are a lot of items to buy and trade from as from here players enjoyed the fact that it was something different and decided to begin the trading campaign but unfortunately players continued to some extent that it became an idling hatgenerater valve had suddenly realised that players liked the concept of the idea and thought well if this gives us enough money to support our game well go along with it so basically it completely flipped Team_Fortress_2 well the other way around or should i say upside down now all youll see in servers from valvecreated to communitycreated are people who spend their own money and constantly trade out virtual accessories until they can somehow manage to become greaterbetter than everyone else or to attempt to look impressive whilst Team_Fortress_2 is still considerably great you can still easily compare between now and 4 5 previous years well lets say back in 2010 there wasnt even an option or such thing as trading in this astonishing firstperson shooterid also like to mention about unlockable weapons unlockable weapons were more important back then but now weapon drops arent fascinating anymore they require very little effort to buy or sell as theyre so cheap compared to accessories in regards to accessories again now all we see are the oh so fabulous particle effects painted cosmetics and ridiculous stupid oversized and overused genre of the same rubbish right now and i certainly know it youre most likely thinking to yourself what is wrong with all of the accessories theres nothing wrong with it and its been like this for years okay yes i understand that tradingmicrotransactions is pretty much the only reason why Team_Fortress_2 is alive right now but that just makes the matter worse in general for the people who are curious about the items in general being added in theyre pretty much all communitycreated and are directly from the workshop which is obviously why the installation for the game is unnecessarily big because of the amount of accessories theyve packed filled it with even though the workshop is a good concept within steam its situation with Team_Fortress_2 is rather different though again microtransactions yes i understand free to play games will eventually require money in the long run so we were expecting the bundle of hats or mannco store reallyso in any way shape or form i recommend that you give Team_Fortress_2 a try and see if you enjoy it be sure to play it out with training for awhile like i did also try to avoid trading at the moment especially its not a great way for new players to enjoy the game itself and im definitely being sincere 1600 hours of game time is accuracy so in the long run this game will likely become tiring and overused due to players who idle and constantly trade in which they are willing to somehow look prettier than everyone elsetldr Team_Fortress_2 is an amazing and unique game but ever since valve decided to introduce the mannco store it nearly ruined the game all thanks to trading"
Loadout,"oh god how i miss this game i really do there were those times when id had a bad day or just needed to unwind and cranking up Loadout was the key to quenching that desire to annihilate things its actually a kickass game what with all the weapon combinations and the fastpaced play style but i just cant think of Loadout in the same way anymorei left the game for others in about october and this march i decided to give it another go and for some strange reason i couldnt find a game well the reason this game has been abandoned this glorious beautiful crudehumored game has been abandoned those days where i would join a local server and join the mayhem are long gone now i have to join uk servers with 400 ping just to get a matchwhere did the atmosphere go edge of reality on general principles i tend not to judge but its hard not to see the developers abandoning the pc version for the ps4 edition as a betrayal of the fanbase what now does some indie developer come along and make a cutrate version of this that nobody plays sorry Loadout your time has passed"
Portal,"i really really wanted to give halflife 2 a positive review i truly didthe fact of the matter though is that i was never enthralled by this game i tried to be but its a bit too generic for me to get into its definitely fun to pick up the game for a half hour and put holes in a few combine and headcrabs but thats as far as it goes for me the story is okay too but nowhere near as good as that of say the Portal franchise hell probably even tf2 when you include the web comics has a better storyif youre a big fan of fps games then youll probably like this game but when i speak from my own opinion i just cant recommend halflife 2rating 610"

Portal,"i hate to be the barren of reviewing games ive played but i was expecting more out of this game when i first saw this on greenlight i thought this could be the perfect alternative towards Portal qube because they dont work on my current laptop but then i heard that this game was discounted at 96 hearing that must of made the game sound really bad but i ignored it i read the description of polarity claiming that its the most fun puzzle game since Portal i even saw a comment on the greenlight page that the devs dont even know what Portal was gameplay was just too simple it lasted only for an hour on my side the first time playing Portal brought so much confusion that it was thrilling this game just wanted me to go to sleep i also looked around the levels set up i saw so many flaws that it looked like it was rushed from development just to gain revenue the worst part about it is that it has no decent story Portals story was so fasinating that i want to find out more about its connections with halflife 2 polarity states that your a hacker thats trying to access a virtual vault when these levels dont look anything like a firewall in conclusion if you want a better puzzle game at a cheap price get something that was made perfectly looks challenging even if it has mixed ratings all that it can be used now is to haul trading cards allowing a short sleep mode onto yourself"
Portal,"i first heard about rexaura long ago when i first got familiar with the blue Portals mod great mod by the way i never had been so confused on these tests that i should of took a refresher course after downloading it i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have their minds twisted tangled by these extraordinary elements just remember you need Portal not Portal 2 in order to play rexaura"

Tf2,"the review preludemy friend jacko has reminded me that this game is early access and cost me a whopping 99 cents audthe reviewif you have read my review of this game in the last few days it was a do not recommend with some frustration strewn throughout however i have now replayed it with controls set up in a way that actually works now this review is happily a recommend although there is a way to go the bulk of the game is there and appears to be solid enough oh and may i also recommend that you start playing as an assult class it is a simple class and one that gets you a feel for the game nicelythe backgroundi played orion prelude and when this came out bam instabuy i finally get around to trying it and its no longer first person view this may not be a deal breaker for you but thats what i love playing ive been informed below that in version 15 fpv is backthe gamethere are two modes of view top down third person and over the shoulder third person and the v15 first personthings i likelooks quite nice gtx 750 tithe harvester has a sense of humour dthere appears to be a lot of work gone into the techupgrade tree hopefully this will allow for diverse specialised set ups for peoplenow that i have proceeded past the initial shock of the change of view i can see why jacko again said that he really enjoyed his first play and made friends hes pretty easy to get along with when you first meet so thats a good sign im yet to delve into the online version of this as my time was shortthings i dont likethe jump binding is conveniently called roll dual purpose in actual fact the whole control system seems to very geared towards handheld controllersthe game takes a while to load but shows no indication that it is indeed loading in fact it doesnt even show up on the taskbar making me think each time that its frozen intel core i54690 25ghz 16gb ram win 10the character that is you seems disconnected from the world that is to say that the world could be projected onto a wall and you just dance around in front of it for over the shoulder viewthe action of the grenade throw and the actual grenade movement is lame needs work early accesscertain characters ie assault insist upon saying look at me go every time you use the jetpack not a major gripe but i hope in the final release it gives that a break from 100 of the timediscoveriesf1 key switches between views thanks jackodespite you view not being first person out of the visor the world around you seems to move with your characters breathing and as i wrote above and youll read in the comments in version 15 true first person view will be backi cant tell if its my underspecd character or that the jump boost ceiling is very low but getting around up high is very hardif you do manage to get up above the ground only the dino flyers even attempt to get you most ground dinos become confused and dont necessarily even attempt their primary destructive objectivethere are hats Tf2 oh how youve changed the worldthere are drops and chests to be founddem feelsmy initial feelings about this game was that i didnt get it i got the prelude but this one now that i have rejiggerd the controls and played it again on a simpler class i had more of an affinity for it so im happier nowthe end bitim sure more things will come to light as i play this in multiplayer mode and im glad i gave this game another chance i look forward to seeing where the devs take thisthanks to jacko neomeinx and cjnfl for helping me with this review"

Terraria,"let me tell of a recent adventure i had while playing this with my friendwe started on a large island wasnt as large as i thought it would be but it was large enough of course we started gathering woods first so we could have a shelter for the first night whereas my friend focused more on the framework i focused more on making our shelter look pretty by adding a japanesethemed roof once we placed the last chair the guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his our first night wasnt bad we just stayed inside made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range so for the whole night we shot zombies with our bows and arrowsthe rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that we collected woods and sometimes stones improved on our shelter which eventually turned into a tower and eventually mined we kept mining a specific network which in time lead us to the underworld now mind you we played on hardcore so if i died then i die for good on that server anywho our first trip to the underworld wasnt too bad we made a hellevator and rode it down to the underworld we scouted for a bit until we were attacked by demons when we lost more that 50 of our health we knew it was time to go back and so we teleported back home with our magic mirrorsso from that day forward our mission was to mine the hell out of hell now this is where the story ends i thought for sure that i would have died from a demon or fell and slipped into lava but no it was from something else entirely i decided to discover more of the network of caves and hope to find treasure chests here and there but no i stepped on a pressure plate and a boulder fell on me i died while my friend laughed and stole my items that was when i stopped playing Terraria then update 13 came and i was like yipee i wonder what other deadl y contraptions redigit has in store for mepls excuse bad inggris"

Dishonored,"murdered soul suspect is a very intriguing noirstyle adventuregame and experience you experience play the game as ronan who is a cop that gets killed by this serial killer only known as the bell killer that hes chasing becomes a ghost and is trying to find out who killed him why not only that but ronan is also trying to find out why the killer has been also killing people the game is set in salem massachusetts which is widely known historically for the salem witch trials and is an excellent setting for this games story throughout the game ronan is on this mission of finding the killer and embarks on this excellent story that any fan of noir thrillers and murdermysteries should experience just for that aloneronan is a ghost with that ronan comes by some interesting abilities ronan can jump into their bodies and possess them ronan can influence other npcs to do things once he has possessed them ronan can even possess cats and even more around in their body ronan can read their minds ronan later on can even teleport to hard to reach areas or out of danger similar to the blink ability in Dishonored for corvo daud in one of the most legit uses of letting your character clip through walls doors and even other human beings you can manipulate objects like a poltergeist such as tvs so they go static and printers and knock the paper out to distract enemies all of this is at first very odd and strange but this is also makes this game interesting unique very cool and very different especially once you get used to itunfortunately there are stealth sequences in the game not that this game needed any since they feel so halfbaked and are for the most part not fun a great concept is in place since ghosts and their residue linger you can teleport to these spots to hide you have to avoid demons who when nearby have a lethal scream that can damage you and even possibility kill you if you can get behind the enemy you can attack them and oneshot kill them which feels like a quicktime event that tells you what button movement on the gamepad yes i played this with an x360 gamepad by the way and it played fine with that in theory this all sounds pretty cool but it really isnt its not executed that well unfortunately these elements feel halfbaked and you can die very easily not only that but like many games with autosaves dont be surprised if the game reloads at place thats a bit away from youd have liked the save to have been at andor have to do a certain section over and over many times that really shouldnt need to be done again bc the save was so poorly placed ie before a cutscene at a longwinded walk before you reach a location where the saved shouldve beensometimes youll be escorting a character safely from one spot to another and your objective is to move manipulate objects like a poltergeist just to distract them so the npc can move from one location to another these elements are very cool and really play into the ghost theme that the game is going on in this game these certainly were much better than the stealth elements than were in the gamewhen investigating crimescenes or locations whether on the main quest or the very few storybased sidequests you often have to find a handful or so of clues more or less in the gameworld or specific game area sometimes you then have to also answer a few questions that youre asking yourself or well the game is asking as youre piecing the story and events together and come by the right answer to push the plot stort forward when investigating you are scored from 13 badges dont make mistakes you get 3 badges make another mistake 2 badgescore make more than that 1star score no matter what theres no real punishment for failing theres no reload screen for failing andor you arent really arent scored with a total score on how well or poorly you did so theres no real consequences for failing you can pick the wrong answer get a 1 score and not even worry about your score you could guess if you cant figure out the answer narrowing it down via trial and error if you feel so inclinedthere are plenty of collectathons for side quests from finding info about your character to seeing old memories and other things the game is loaded w collectibles many of these they actually do reveal more about the salem setting salems history the gameworld the killer and the characters in the story so if you want to get the most out of this games story setting atmosphere and characters youll likely want to find a good deal of these finding this stuff certainly actually does enhance the already interesting fantastic excellent storyperformance on this game with most things on higher settings on my pc i7 950 1 gb vram geforce gtx 560 ti 16 gb ram at 1080p was a bit over the place frequently jumping between 3560 frames locking vsync on to halfrefresh rate via the nvidia panel certainly solved this problem keeping the game regularly not budging at all from 30 frames per second while the graphics in this game do look good they certainly are not the best technical quality that is out thereafter the 10 hours or so i spent with this game according to steam the mystery was over i came to the games conclusion thrilled with the plot story gameworld setting and characters but i was certainly not thrilled and often frustrated with the games halfbaked stealth elements while i do wish the game had more storybased side quests that the games socalled puzzles were a bit harder i still came away really enjoying a good deal of the actual experience itself if only the gameplay elements

Evolve,"dont get me wrong the game is great but i simply cant let these issues go bywhy i dont care about the f2p changethe game was dying so they made it free to try to save their game am i heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off for losing 60 bucks yes i am but they had to do this or i would never have the chance to enjoy this game again also the founders edition gives people who bought the game a lot of stuff they also promised to make even more little things for the people who have been supporting them since the start this means that us founders the people who really cared for this game will continue to get more exclusive itens in short the reason for this review isnt the f2p change its because of the stupid ways they changed the game to please idiots who played 2 minutes of the game and started screaming heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit about the it cof cof angryjoe cof cof what they have heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ed upthey made the dome a shared ability something i do not agree with since it takes away a huge part of being a trapper and also discourages teamwork also you cant miss but that barely scraches the surface of the problem they also added regenerative health and even though its already way too fast there are perks that can greetly speed it up the medic only becomes useful during combat which now its the focus of the game theres no such thing as stealth theres only planet scanners every 30 seconds who force the monster to constantly run actually he doesnt need to run because he can teamwipe at stage 1 in fact they should call this game not Evolve they also decreased the dropship time to a minute and a half there goes one of emet strengts what they turned the game intoin short they turned a game about hunting into a massive monster batteling cluster heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit made Evolve not worth evolving and destroyed teamwork this game is broken gameplaywise and they need to remove this friendly piece of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit mechanics that they decided to add people who started playing now wont even notice but we do and if this doesnt get changed we will forever miss what Evolve used to beps where did all the maps and modes go"

Loadout,"templar battleforce review omni horizontemplar battleforce review by andrew salfinger rating 810 " templar battleforce is a must have for all fans of tactical strategy games " omni horizonhello my name is andrew from omni horizon below you will find our first video game reviewread the review link removedhttpbitly1one2h3backstorytrese brothers the company behind star traders rpg 4x empires heroes of steel cryber knights templar assault and age of priates are back again with templar battleforce the fourth game set in the star traders scifi worldthe game follows templar knights are a martial order sworn to protect the star traders - the last known free humans under the guidance of the templars and the prophet shalun the star traders departed the ruins of the galactic core - leaving behind the desolation wrought by the great galactic war guided by the prophet the star traders sought a new home among the stars across the multigenerational journey of the great exodus many ships have disappeared fallen behind or splintered from the main fleet - scattering the star traders to the galactic windswith the great exodus coming to an end the star traders founded new colonies on the few remaining habitable worlds the templar knights are called upon once again to defend the star traders and their new colonies from an ancient threatreviewtemplar battleforce is a pickup and plays squad tactical grid combat game with a focus on defending or advancing through swarms of enemies while completing objectives via set scenarios it shares common ground with other squad tactics games like xcom and the more recent warhammer 40k games it adds its own spin on progression by blending tabletop rpg attributes light tech tree management and weapongear Loadouts to give it its own unique feel and tone to the genresome players who may be new to this type of game may find it overwhelming so let ' s break down the basics each turn every character in your unit will have six " move points mp " this will allow you to move six squares after using up all mp the character will not be able to move till the next player turn if you use up all six mp this does not mean you can ' t attack for that each character also get five " ap " you will use these to use abilities and attack when it ' s the players turn planning this stage is also recommend since different abilities will use different amounts of ap you can do this by clicking on a character in your unit then at the button of the screen you will see your characters ability then right clicking on one will tell you how much ap it will usethe game fills great and from a small indie team they have done an amazing job you can fill the love and passion they have put into this game the combat is quick and quite challenging you can kill an enemy within one turn tho it can also happen the other way around so you will need to be on your toes with your strategy in this game you don ' t just want to grab shoot get out of there you will need a plan it ' s important to have each member of your squad cover and support one another because if any single member is left exposed they will quickly be overwhelmed at the end of the day crowd control is the key of the game you are also often playing against the clock you ' re encouraged to race through and complete each scenario as fast as possible if you stay put and try to bide your time you will usually lose by getting overwhelmedone of the great things within the combat turn is " free forming " where any of your characters can do any action in any order you wish you don ' t even have to use them all before moving to another character or ending your turn this was a nice change from the normal you have to do it in this order or else type gameplay and opens up the strategy and adds a new layer of gameplayprogression is handled within the game a couple of different ways one of them is with the " requisition " system or skill tree on first glance there is a lot going on here but the requisition is broken down into sections like engineer scout soldier captain and so on you can pick the skills in order of what type of unit you want to play and focused onother ways are with traditional skills and attributes as well as weaponarmoraugment Loadout you take into battlethere is some light customization with a color swap portrait swap and renaming to personalize but it is not very in depth some more options and perhaps different graphics for the more robust armor and weapons would help give the characters a little more distinction and personalitythe game also haves things called " tactical points that you can capture and control on the map they generate currency over time you can use to resupply deploy extra squad members and give your squad bonuses tho be careful the enemy can and will try to destroy these " tactical points " so i always felt compelled to protect them and at some points it can be critical in some levels however it can also be a misleading lure where you could get caught up in stands off against the enemy when you should instead be pushing aheadthe ui in the game is easy to use and to understand i like the style and fit ' s the game it does not feel out of place the games ui also haves some useful tooltips for most elements in the game and does a good job of explaining you can also change the ui by hitting " tab " this will allow you to see all characters within your unitmusic in the game i quite liked for an indie game tho nothing stood out some are catchy and help capture the mood but some tracks seem cut short and can become weary after several plays sound effects are also serviceable but nothing amazing the game is also all text based with no voice acting but that was expected due to voice acting costing a lot and if they went the cheap route it would have ended badlylet ' s talk about the story i was surprised with how it expanded and was not expecting much from it due to it being a squad tactical game it could however be more robust that is not saying it ' s not any good and that you should skip away the story does give you hints and what you should do among other things the focus however is on the combat and how you handle it yourself in battle most of the plot and background development will happen through cut scenes monologs dialog trees and discussions with the fellow crew at headquarters it would have been nice if it tied in with more of the other star traders gamesthe graphics in the game are not bad it haves a nice grunge alien look to them some people may find it bland and or lacking this is an indie and graphics comes second to gameplay and everything else the main seller for this game is the combat and they did an amazing job of that templar battleforce has made a better tactical strategy games and then most other aa ones that have come out in the past couple of yearsanother thing i really liked about this game is when you start it up i love the main menu in this game

Undertale,"if you are here and reading this and you want to make a review about how this game isnt good its gon na be hardUndertale is a rpg like a bunch of others the story is just sorta a no and a yes the game is a feel trip and thats a bad thing not just because it makes you sad its mainly because it cant make this 1 person not sad at all for 1 game character also the pixelly artwork is mehnormal in my opinion the controls are fine as expected for an overrated game i mean who doesnt know a good game has good controls right ha anyways lets move on to the music the music is alright pretty normal for an rpg yet there was some where they were just very meh and thats just my taste in music you might find it badass or something but i dont like it so thats just my opinion theres something in Undertale i think is missing and the game itself is just terrible and good yes the main reason i am giving this a bloody no no is mainly because of the fact of the story and vibe you cant just find out what the story is how frisk got into the place maybe falling down dragged down or something the story isnt explained just right hell even finding out the monsters creation yes of course games like legend of zelda and other games might have this heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit but their just from like not completely explained from their existance that is sorta explained in lozoot itself also the characters they are mehgood also if i didnt already write thatanyways 4910 this is just my opinion you should buy it still even if its a no no for meenjoy your game once you got it"

Evolve,"blockstorm this is one of those games that can give a large amount of replayability the game features a few gamemodes such as deathmatch team deathmatch capture the flag and assault the gameplay is well put and will be very familiar if you have ever played the original ace of spades and not the piece of crap remake the game also features two editors a map editor and a character editor the editors at first seem diffcult but once you find out what does what you should be able to use them just fine the main thing i like about this game is the fact that you can have your own personalised character skin which you create yourself which can take some timeid recommend people buy this game now while it is still in the early stages so you can see the game Evolve into something greater im even sure once more people find out about this game it will top that shotty remake of ace of spades so come on down and join the battle1010"

Tf2,"such a funny game takes the seriousness and enjoyment of poker and removes the stress with fun tables and cards and absolutely hilarious lines id recommend removing the censor but thats just my preference tycho swears a ton it can get a little frustrating after you lose a few games in a row or when youre trying to get a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit straight flush but its enjoyable in other ways you dont actually lose money you can enjoy poker without stress the other guys say some really funny lines and of course the reason why 60 of you buy this game the Tf2 items a police badge a sweet pistol some slick shades sasha and a bloody watch but this game isnt just about the Tf2 items i bought it because i wanted to enjoy it and took the items as a bonus it is quite fun to strategise how to win the game and how to target a certain item without ing up and that feeling when you get a flush a full house or a straight and you destroy everyone elses hands or when you win with a pair of twos this game is so much more than 5 of Tf2 items highly recommend"

Evolve,"this was the first ever game i got on steam let me say its still as entertaining nowits the final capstone of the dawn of war series and it does its jobit has a mostly rich campaign that was well thought out has a degree of difficulty and makes sensenow its not as rtsish as the first dawn of war games however its kind of Evolved to feel more like tabletopgood pointsa choice of three characters per army in multiplayereach multiplayer faction eldar space marines orks tyranids chaos space marines imperial guardsmen has a trio of unique heroes to use to represent you ingame mostly these generals fall into offense defense support there are also stealth and teleportation heroes but they are fewer than those threeimperial guardimperial guard has the inquisitor as offense the commissar lord as support and the lord general as defensethe inquisitorthe inquisitor mostly focuses on purge everything with fire and she does it well her main weapon wargear gives her abilities to combat small amounts of powerful foes and large amounts of lessthans with relative ease she does however fall off against tanks and superheavies a little but i mean come onthe commissar lordthe commissar lord focuses around boosting nearby squads and nearby squads boosting him sound a bit cryptic well a certain peice of wargear he can get boosts his health regeneration depending on how many nearby friendly squads there are other than this he is also superior for demoralizing and debuffing enemy troops reducing damage output tankability etc unfortunatly he too suffers against tanks and superheaviesnot looking good for guardsmen huhthe lord generalso the other two fall off against tanks and superheavies well here is redemption the lord general is followed by a personal squad that get the same weapon as he does upgrade him with flamer burn all the troops upgrade with melta astala heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off tanks on this topic when you give him a meltagun he gains the ability to turn nearby allies gun cooldown to 0 gun cooldown wtf does that mean its basically the reload of a gun or the time between bursts that a gun fires hence it has no boost on flamersbut on autocannons that fire basically miniature rocketsspace marineswelcome to the fanboys wet dream the space marines have a captain for offense apothecary for healing and techmarine for defensethe captainwelcome to the all you can eat antieverything extraveganza hes basically a glorified sargent who can be upgraded to specialise against everything that not enough for you well then look no further he can be upgraded into tactical dreadnaught armor aka terminator armor which takes away most of his options of weapons and stuff but as the name suggests gives you a hell of a lot of resistance while in termy armor you can equip an assualt cannon good against heavy troops a heavy flamer good against light troops and twin power claws good against anythingthe apothacaryas his name and specialty suggests the apothacarys strength lies in his ability to keep units and even allied heroes alive when giving the sanguine chainsword and put with a personal squad of assualt terminators this guy just wont go down easily his global abilities also allow him to revive allied heroes from anywhere on the mappretty niftythe techmarinenot really much to see here hes kind of just your normal defensearchtype can build turrets and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit and is fairly tankychaos space marinesthe chaos space marines mine and my best friends personal favorite for offense they have the mighty chaos lord for defense the putrid plague champion and for support thesorcerorthe chaos lordthis guy is the biggest cheese around you know how i said terminator armor was an upgrade for the captain well this guy gets it free he has superior antihero capability and all around antieverything unfortunatly i havent played him much so i cant tell you much more than thatthe plague championthis guy is my bro while the apothacary can keep his guys alive this guy can simultainiously do that kill enemies and give toughness auras not only this but his antiinfantry capability is absolutely amazing he is capable of destroying 5 squads of guardsmen with a single dot grenade alongside this he also give global abilities to boost this further like making a highly damaging cloud that tears through squads and an ability that once enemies die they come back for a little bit as mo heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing zombies the sorcerorthis guy is just heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit your turrets normally youd have to waste a few guys flanking base turrets with this badass you can teleport him behind their turrets and then use a global to bring every unit you control to him ez13zthe eldarthisis actually getting boring quickly and im still on the first good pointcan i stop now sanyway other good pointsstory mode and multiplayer are amazing and have few bugslast stand despite a few bad points is actually the reason i love this gamebad points last stand has lots of bugs and some characters have very little background and thats itgg"

Starbound,"i would like to start my analysis saying that if you like scifi games you will certainly love Starbound Starbound has a incredible power of make you just want to explore the damn universe you can choose between 6 races and they are perfect well chosen by the creator the game stills in beta test and it is awesome i imagine that game in the end without bugs and perfectly ended as a classic of the new 2d games but i think that they should improve the storyboard such as creat some items but in general i recommend that game for everyone"
Undertale,"well if you looking for a game with terrible gameplay cliche story and the most uninteresting characters ever createdthen your in the wrong place this game is a masterpeice and deserves all the praise its been getting the gameplay is extremely unique since it mixes jrpg elements with bullet hell this was a brilliant idea all the characters are extremely interesting i dont think i came across one enemy that i thought was boring this can also be said for the music the music in this game omg where do i start the music is amazing and clearly has had a lot of time put into creating the perfect tune for each encounter oh by the way the game is extremely funny and is self realised from every little joke made at almost averything you interact with Undertale surprisingly has a really in depth morality system that will remember everything you did in your playthrough this effects greatly how the story will play out and even goes on to shape how your next run will gonow heres where the game hooks you the mostthe feelsi dont think ive ever been as emotionaly scared Undertale does a brilliant job at making you feel like what your doing matters from showing mercy and making friends with everyone to being a completely psychopathic murderer oh and if you thought that you can just reset the game and try again if you say accidentally kill someone well your going to have a bit of a surprise when you run into them again thats all im goint to sayand yes this game has great replay value since there are multiple endings that are actually vastly different from each other so overall this game is a must buy trust me you wont regret it"

Loadout,"absolutely heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing savage what a true doom reboot should be and one of the best fps games i have played in years i have played doom since 1993 and still play and make maps to this day for the originals so my review is based on how it it as a reboot to the series and how it pits itself against modern fps games1010 for the single playerthe weapon system is awesome choosing what upgrades to use when you want to use them switching between each weapon flawlessly and quick feels so fluidthe monsters are designed beautifuly including the bosses who are heaps better than what doom 3 had to offer anytime i would see the arch vile summoner i would actually go into panic mode as it was the only monster that i had issues with the enviroments are absolutely beautiful and detailed as hell the music is badass and fantastic the ost needs to be released i would happily pay money for itthe action is actually extremely fast paced in sp and a blast there wasnt a dull moment in doom that i could find the optimization for this game too is amazing only running a 950m and i74720hq and can play this game flawlessly 30 ish fps on medium and 45ish fps on low yes i know time for an upgrade but building a pc when the 1080 comes outi loved this game so much i bought it twice once for pc and once for ps4multiplayer 710dont get me wrong i love the multiplayer ive had a blast with it but i personally didnt think it lets itself up to be what it could have been Loadouts and game speed are the killer for me other than that the multiplayer is great tons of stuff to unlock badass armour to equip and running a match where you absolutely dominate just feels so great the demon runes too are a blast to play as as well but all in all besides demon runes the multiplayer doesnt offer too much new ideas still fun though biasm due to obsession with doom as a whole may be included in this multiplayer reviewsnapmaps 510 hopefully 910 in the coming months and 710 if you dont know how to or never will modas of right now snapmaps is a boring useless tool and i dont see many great things come of it yet12 monster limit bugs in the logic weird bugs limited things about the way you can build maps and the presets are boring as hell spent 2 full days making a map and probably wont ever make a map again if i only got the game on ps4 i probably would rate it higher as it is a wonderful map editor for console but for pc it is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit doom needs true modding support and there should be way less limitations on snapmap for pc plus no boss monsters on snapmap disappointing although idbethesda plan to release a lot more content for snapmap i dont see it ever becoming a replacement for modding support however for people who cant or never will pick up modding it will be great for you also the menus for navigating snapmap maps is a mess right now with the same content appearing on the front page all the timethere is work that needs to be done for snapmaps at the moment a lot of workmy 4th and final critisicm of the game is no modding support as said above hopefully someone can find a way to make modding possible but as of right now i dont see that happening for a long timeas for dlc if all they plan to release is multiplayer related dlc and snapmap related dlc i think they are going in the wrong direction the fans from what ive seen and including myself want singleplayer dlc other than that heres a recapsingleplayer 1010multiplayer 710snapmaps 510 710 910the singleplayer experience alone trumps the mp and snapmaps enough that i highly highly recommend it to anyone who likes fps games doom games or action gamesps if you love devil may cry or dmc you will find this game right at home for you"

Portal,"Portal 2 is the sequel to the puzzle game Portal which showed off revolutionary gameplay mechanics along with great storytelling Portal 2 builds upon the first games storyline you play as chell a test subject at aperture laboritories where instead of using a normal gun you must utilise the Portal gun which creates two connected points in spacethis game really knows how to create a great story when the game starts a sphere droid thingie called wheatley saves you from your room and takes you with him to try and escape aperture only to awaken glados the interactions between glados are really witty and funny with great voice actingthe puzzles themselves are very good the mechanic of the Portal along with some very clever test elements such as lasers gels and turrets are fun to work with almost every test chamber has a new way of solving something however the puzzles dont get overly hard they mostly stay around the medium difficulty markwith this sequel there is now a coop mode where you play with a friend as either atlas or pbody this mode is a elcome edition and the servers run smoothly save for the occasional disconnect the witty glados dialogue is still there although now shes comparing the two bots insulting them and even pitting them against eah other the puzzles are still fun and in most cases are harder than the main game cooperating is half the batlle but this is helped by good microphone support and the ping tool which is used to mark locationsnow that the new upate is in new features have been added there is now a timetrial mode for the single player and multiplayer modes which is like a built in feature for speedrunners where you can check your friends times as well as the worlds this works well in my opinion i havent encountered any errors though getting into a multiplayer time trial game is pretty hard also there is now a level editor this is really easy to use and yet beautifully complex the menus are a bit fiddly though complex and challenging puzzles can and have been made and uploaded to the steam workshop though a lot of these gems are surrounded by mindless garbage and maps that arent even puzzles that somehow reach the front pageall in all i would recommend this game to any player of any skill level Portal 2 is a puzzle game with tons of content and replayability level editor great puzzles and puzzle elements fun coop mode time trail modes a great edition can be buggy95 10tl dr buy it now"

The_Community,"anyone not interested in backstory skip to next paragraph well i have a lot to say about this game two years ago as a person who was sick of all the physics builders where you build something extremely fragile and watch it crash into a wall and explode i was looking for something new and different one day i turned steam on and in the daily feed that always pops up i saw a new game had just been released on steam called robocraft immediately interested i downloaded the game and found myself in literally exactly what i had been looking for ever since i first discovered minecraft a battle arena game where you build your contestants literally from scratch the devs actively published new updates that improved the game and for a good year robocraft was the best and only game i ever routinely played a lot has changed since thenthe devs released this game with the intentions of keeping it as not only a freetoplay f2p game but a free to win game as well one where nothing that actually altered the gameplay would be locked behind paywalls this is one of the issues i would like to talk about the old system had you earning a certain amount of rp the currency previously used that you could spend on pretty much anything except for cosmetic parts which didnt affect gameplay at all you earned a decent amount from playing and each day all of your bots in each garage before you started with 3 garages and had to pay for more would have a 2x multiplier on your score from your first victory each day with each bot this system allowed you to get what you wanted when you wanted it now with the crate drop system your hard earned winnings are completely randomized one day you could get essentially nothing the next you could get the rarest items in crate after crate this system has more or less been fine with the endgame players and beginners but the middle class of players those who had been playing for a little while and were working their way up got hit hard you need a tank track to finally complete that bot but dont have enough robits to forge one too bad you got a hover blade or some cubes thats not even mentioning the horrible and broken economy check the subreddit one of my friends posted an explanation on how the system is brokenthe roboshop has also ruined the game once if you wanted a great bot you had to make it yourself or at least build it from the ground up with a guide both of which taught you a lot on how to build a robot but now you can buy an overpowered bot from the shop without lifting a finger this massively destroys the whole feel of the game as you arent forced to learn how to make a bot better cause if it isnt you can just dismantle it and buy a new onefinally the devs arent listening to their community they claim that the game is forged from The_Communitys feedback but if it was epic loot wouldnt exist or at least would be made with a much better economy if you dont get what you want from a crate you can simply reforge it or so was the idea lets use a legendary as example to buy a mega smg it costs 12500 robits to sell one on the other hand you would only get 31250 meaning it would take you 4 mega smgs among the hardest items to randomly get in the game to make 1 what kind of economy is thattldr robocraft used to be good the tiers more or less worked at least better than it does now we didnt have or even want some of the items we do now and the economy is not only bad but also broken the devs need to start listening to their community and bending the game to how the players want to play my advice wait dont get the game as it is now and see if the devs finally change it to be fun as it used to be"

Dont_Starve,"Dont_Starve is already a fun game with many intricate game mechanics so klei creating a multiplayer version was a brilliant idea if you have not starved before in single player imgaine trying to do that while supporting friends at the same time another good feature about multiplayer is that multiple characters means mulitple bonuses eg wilson for beard wolfgang for damage willow forwellfire also the workshop is also included and provides some fun different charactersitems to play with regarding dying when someone inevitabley dies they will become a ghost this ghost will lower players sanity until revived into a player again using methods such as touch stone life giving amulet meat effigy and after this occurs the player will have less maxium health but this maxium health can be restored with a booster shoot which isnt too hard but not easy to make overall this is a high amount of fun espically over skype with friends but it also has a few bugs early accesso in shortrating 9510 would not starve together again"

Csgo,"still not global elite after wasting a year i recommend to people who have suicidal tendencies and do not care for lives after installing this game please hang yourself at google hangouts a real hangout also if you install this game you can get an expansion pack that provides sunlight and a soccer ball if you do have a girlfriend i recommend not playing this game because it encourages aggression on the other hand if your girlfriend likes bdsm all for it also this game dissolves relationships among your friends and promotes being an a55hole for example my friend who complains about Csgo and how he is held back and blames his team mates has now become alot more aggresive and annoying in real life Csgo is bad for our youth and encourages offensive language and behaviorthere are 4 types of people who play Csgo1 the competitive heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit s me2 the casuals3 the surfers4 the bunny heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit stldr Csgo is bad for people who have a functional life but good for people who live in their mums basement Csgo is bad for our youth"
Dota_2,"Dota_2 is a real competetive game that is extremely entertaining with friends Dota_2 is by far the most competetive game in the world and will most likely live to be one i would prefer playing this game with friends to communicate with easily eg mic while playing i prefer Dota_2 over RIRE becauseDota_2 is a much more competetive game because you do not need to buy the heroes in RIRE you would need specific heroes to counter other heroes and it may be RIRE is designed to be more of a social moba and make players get addicted to the game this is why they have made the locked RIRE is just heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit okay"

Team_Fortress_2,"Team_Fortress_2 is a game loved by many all ages seem to play it and enjoy it i used to play it myself but i grew to like other games and didnt really play it as often the game itself does have its ups and downs like the goodness when you earn an achive or get a new item the 1 main thing i dont like about it is that it updates nearly every week and needs to do another take of my internet and eats it like a bear and i dont get unlimated internet like most so its even harder but its still an ok game but i always do wonder why 1825 year olds still play it dont you have something a bit more important to do in your life at that age 5 and a half 10"

Evolve,"the game idea is pretty good but i think some improvements should be made such as maybe making coop i mean a lone ranger vs 56 robots with few ammo in your inventory is pretty much death for you so maybe having your assistant with you might make a huge difference also if you took the hint there is rarely any ammo to be found throughout the map at best 1 in 4 houses has like a clip of rEvolver ammo food is abundant though i do think this game has potential and i if there is future awesome updatesi would be up for it 710"

Dishonored,"well then how to sum up Dishonored cnsidering its the only thing ive done in my spare time except when i was forced off the computer to do other things like read books and be in the sun which i swear is unhealthy for the past 2 weeks and counting i can say its pretty goodyou play as an assassin former bodygaurd to the empress and framed for her murder you are tasked with bringing down the corrupt empire that was formed after the empress was killed which consits of the man who framed you and various allies and minions that he has at his disposalyou do this with the help of the loyalist conspiracy a group tasked to putting the rightful heir that being the empress daughter on the throne who was kidnapped at the time of the empress death you are also contacted by a religous figure known as the outsider who grants you special abilities such as magic and enhanced human ability like being able to jump rather highi very much enjoy this game because you can really change up the approach that you want to take and as there are several different routes on every level it has a lot of replayability i have finished the game once on playstation in which i went for amoslty stealth aproach and twice on steam on the first playthrough i went for clean hands and ghost and on the second i went for mostly flesh and steel another great thing about this game is that your choices particulary the amount of people you kill has an effect on the game i wont mention too much because of spoilers but one of the effects is if you kill a great number of people there will be more weepers which are zombie like plague victims as well as there being more rats in this game you will use stealth and magic or if you choose you will go all out fighting without any regard for safety you will kill everyone you meet apart from allies of course or you will kill no one how you play this game is entirely up to you and the amount of ways to play give it a lot of replayability i cant reccomend this game enough i must give it a 1010 for being my favourite game please dont look at any of my other reviews for guidance though because i mostly made them in 30 seconds as this is my first serious review any feedback is very welcomethe only real cons to this game is that there is a brothel in the third mission personally i tend to ignore these things though they are rather vile however some people do not feel the same way so i am just putting that out there also to those who say that it is repetative you may find it that way slightly if you do not bother to find any runes or bone charms especially runes which upgrade your magical powers and grant you new ones"
Portal,"its just like Portal 2 but a bit worse"
The_Community,"from the very first videos that promoted this game prior to its launch on steam the game looked impressive melding a voxel game similar in nature to another popular game to a deformable physics platform set in spacefrom it official launch in 2013 space engineers has been in early accessby no means has it been a smooth ride but each week the developers have been adding to and improving the game adding features requested by The_Community as well as adding their own particular enhancementsthe game has grown substantially in that time making space engineers an impressive multiplayer sandbox experiencethe developers have hinted at many new things on the horizon which will no doubt improve the game play immensely and expand the playability when they are released in the coming monthsive personally spent more hours playing this game than any other in my steam catalogue and hope to continue playing for a long time to come if you like building stuff if you like smashing stuff if you like flying space ships if you like exploring massively open space if you like encountering random procedurally generated items if you like buildingflying model replicas of famous scifi ships if you like competing with players to build the biggest meanest ship to pit against one another if you like experimenting with physics if you like The_Community experience of sharing things you have made if you like a game with a large community following if you like a game where players can actively contribute modifications to expand the game if you seeing a developer actively spending time to improve their gamethen please consider having a look at space engineers"

Terraria,"a game of almost infinite possibilities Terraria is a superb game but eventually you will have finished the game and be given nothing in reward besides that this is an excellent game go but it its cheap lots of playtime"
Well_There,"Well_There is a bad side and a good side but i honestly think that the bad side is too much i think the the multiplayer is kinda bad and maybe i dont play it well but you will die too quick so its not gon na be easy and many other issue that you will find in this game but the good side is the story mode is a pretty well done job and the aliens mode is pretty fun but if you are like me that finds game fun only in shooting other people in games i would think that this game is not that great of a multiplayer though its only my opinion some of you might not agree with me because each people have a different opinion so yeah if your looking for a new mode in call of duty well you should try this but like i said if your more of a multiplayer shooting players vs players guy than i would highly recommend not to waste your 60 peace"
Well_There,"this game is amaising i love everything about it Well_There i sone thing and that is that the storage crates have only 4 slots but still it is an amaising game plus it was made by a single 16 year old wow if you like games based on survival and looting and zombies than this is for you cant wait for more updates"

Terraria,"so first off lets just say i dont particularly like this game and when i say that i dont like this game i mean that i really dont like this gamei got this game on release day installed it on release day played around 2 hours on release day it was a weird experience to say the least i think that pretty much everyone who picked up this game on release day was expecting something that was literarily just Terraria in space this game is anything but that from a Terraria perspective the characters are a weird size seeming just too big the game is similar to starbound with the way you mine and build things but starbound just feels more complete the game has a weird graphics style that just doesnt quite complete it seems a bit rough around the edges i am not saying that no one could love it just that i cant if you own Terraria and want a similar experience then get starbound but i already have starbound you say wait for an update to Terraria and then you will be rightif you own startbound and want a similar experience then get Terraria but i already have Terraria you say wait for an update to starbound and then you will be righti can not recommend this game for the simple reason of there are already games out there that do everything this game does but better want a great 2d buildingexploringsandbox experience get Terraria want a great 2d space buildingexploringsandbox experience that isnt quite complete but still great get starbound want some weird space thing get defy gravityps just as a warning for this game there are save wipespps i have also played this game since release day enough to find form valid arguments about this game"

Tf2,"Tf2 is a great fps multiplayer expirience and it is just a big bonus that it is free this game has some very unique gameplay experience mainly that there are 9 very different classes that are genuinely fun to play there is also a very large amount of unique weapons most of them are very fun to use pretty much my only critisism is that valve havnt added weapons for quite a while overall this is an amazing experience that is very entertaining i give it 92510"
Team_Fortress_2,"Team_Fortress_2 at least what i think ias a brilliant game and its avalability to mac aswell as windows make it even better althought definetly nothing new being released in 2006 and not to mention the time for download the game is still definetley one of my favourites by farthis game has lots of free dedicated servers as well as constant updates and for me so for far in my 200 hours of gameplay contains very little lag not to mention still quite a popular game with lots of people playing it even after 8 years after inital release"

Evolve,"the talos principle is a firstperson view storydriven puzzle game you have to solve a variety of setpiece puzzles using a small set of tools and your awesome spatial reasoning to obtain ' sigils ' which are then used to progress in the game it ' s a fun wellpaced expedition though beautiful environments with a thoughtful and interesting backstorythe gameplay mainly rEvolves around finding out by experimentation how the various tools you get interact with the environment and other game elements you might need to figure out how to get on top of a stack of hexahedrons for example hexahedrons are naturally nothing like cubesother game elements include harmless lasers hovering robomines not so harmless and even some sort of holographic recording system makes brain hurt it took me about 35 hours of nearly always enjoyable gameplay to complete almost every goal in the game the difficulty level was almost perfect maybe just a teensy bit too easy but there was still enough challenge for rewarding playthe goodthe environments are beautiful and the graphics rendering while not cutting edge is very good bonus notstateoftheart meant the frame rates were consistently goodpuzzle difficulty seemed a little easy at first but later on there were a few hard ones that were satisfying to solve if you ' re experienced with these sorts of games you ' re unlikely to get stuck for a long time if you ' re a completionist like me there might be a few ones that have you thrashing about for an hour or so before you realize you ' re missing the obvious solution bonus getting to tell myself how smart i was after finding some of the hidden starsthe story was an interesting if lonely one don ' t expect to have much in the way of meaningful interaction with npcs however there are a couple of regulars to keep you on your toes the story is told through reading text excerpts and listening to audio logs and has some poignant moments take a robotissue you can also skip the reading if you ' re just interested in the gameplay and still get to the end bonus getting a free philosophy coursethe story also had an amazing amount of geeky selfconsistency yes that ' s a pro you know it is almost everything in the game was explained or at least alluded to bonus there was even an explanation of why your ingame character had your steam name none of the puzzles tested your leet twitch skilz which is pro for an old gamer like me i found some jumping puzzle easter eggs which required some patience but you can solve all the story puzzles and get all of the achievements without lightning reflexes some of the areas seem like they need good timing to begin with but there ' s usually a safer way of doing it bonus still got it with the jumping skilz babyi also appreciated the motion sickness options on the menu for some reason when i started playing i did get some motion sickness unusually but expanding the field of view and playing with a couple of the other options seemed to help bonus not throwing up over fancy mech keyboardthe badthe game save system suffers from consolitis no manual saves only checkpoint saves it only keeps a limited number of recent saves which interacts poorly with the achievements to get some of them you ' ll probably have to restart from the beginning because you can ' t go back far enough with the saves bogus having to restart to get more achievementssome of the puzzles are pure filler and are not challenging at all all you have to do is go through the motions to solve them given the number of puzzles in the game it wouldn ' t have hurt to cut a few bogus doing all the boring puzzles again after restartingi was not a fan of the tetromino lock puzzles i solved them using a few basic principles and a lot of trial and error i didn ' t find them fun at all the small ones were easy the big ones were annoying i suppose they might appeal to some people but i can understand why they were included and they even had an historical justification which was revealed later in the game bogus doing all the annoying locks again after restartingachievements have a few minor annoyances the main one for me being that some of the achievements require the dlc so without it you can ' t get them all this might be a limitation with steam because the ingame achievement list doesn ' t show those ones also some requirements felt misplaced you ' ll get many achievements automatically for game progress but do something amazing and nada bogus collecting all the sigils all of them no immediate gratification in the form of a little box in the corner of my screen appearing for three seconds a little part of me rejoiced for a moment then died quietly inside seriously dev dudes that was an achievement unlike opening the door near the start of the game or whateverfinally a certain text interaction element of the game felt a bit stilted to me and at times restricted you to some rather odd responses so i didn ' t really find that very engaging bogus not really caringthe uglynothing this game like your humble reviewer looks sounds plays and smells good the verdicthighly recommended for all fans of puzzle games that include cubes of course this is not one of those games this is a puzzle game with hexahedrons"

Team_Fortress_2,"yes i only have 9 minutes but on my old ds i can assure you i have at least 100 hours logged into it this will be a serious review so no ak47 dlcs sp00kiness or memes herethe game is pretty simple the premise is that youre raising adorable cuddly cats and the whole game focuses on your progression and heres why i think this is worth a buy its a good time consumer sicne this is geared for children mainly ill focus on why its good for them and then coem to why at any age this can be a good gamethe game is simple but isnt simple to where it can be called boring challenges start out bland which are mainly just tutorials on how to get the cat fed and such but do rise up in difficulty somewhat but not enough to irritate most children the progression systemmay not be as advanced as alot of other games out there but im sure your child isnt a huge expert in the games industry but jsut because it isnt extremely emmersive it doesnt mean its trash you progress by your cat becoming more affectionate towards you clothing for them more minigames and other things that i cant remember its been years now this game isnt something that can be played hardcore you cant log in 100 hours in a week with this maybe just an hour or two per every few days after school or while you and spouse if present are working another core feature of this game that can make it better than any ipad game which i do see a majority of young children playing video games on ipads but im not an expert on what the most popular platform young children play video games on is that it has no microtransactions what are microtransactions some may ask microtransactions are small fees in the game which are ultimately for you to take money out of your pocket and put it into the developers examples of this are like diamonds used to speed build a building that takes 12 hours to build or more lives on candy crush the game is a one purchase deal you get all the hours of enjoyment and content through the single purchase of 99 which ulitmately can save you alot more money than you think and when it goes on sale definately is something to consider buying edit this game can run on any computer it doesnt have the powerful graphics ability that many games possess today so dont worry about purchasing new partsnow for those whove gotten past the age of 10its a simple game with simple mechanics and a pretty out of date engine it isnt meant to have extreme and powerful graphics its from 2007 its jsut a time killer really i just play this game at night when counterstrike and Team_Fortress_2 get pretty boring and i want something to help me potentially fall asleep i know that since youre older you have other games you wan na buy so really i recommend this as a sale only buy overall rating 810 fun in short bursts simple concept and nostalgic"

Evolve,"short reviewimproved since orion horde but largely remains to be seen theres still plenty of room for improvementfull review gameplaythe game concept is simple for campaign you have to survive a group of invading dinosaurs that will only invade you after you start your first generator and after which you have to drivewalkfly a long distance to activate your inappropriatelymarked second base the capturing base message only appeared after i was some distance away from move the marker and the base itselffor survival its selfexplanatory for pvp its selfexplanatory for sudden death its selfexplanatory if youve played other games that have this every other mode other than campaign rEvolves around these 3 modes only difference lies in whether its a team or one man army or which weapons you get to use changes in gameplaythe last time i played this game was close to a year ago i played only singleplayer and gameplay was at best average you go around capturing bases shooting dinosaurs and perhaps exploiting the map to your advantage everything else was left to yourself there are 3 markers indicating where to get weapons skills and vehicles that was about it even after the transition from orion horde to prelude i found it rather boring along with a nonexistent support team i decided to abandon the gamemany months later i saw their latest video advertisement showcasing how much their game has improved reluctantly i decided to give it a try to my surprise they had actually improved on singleplayer mode you no longer fight alone and have four relatively dumb teammates which will help you when you go down without desperately trying to get a last wind campaignwise i havent managed to get pass the first few bases because the ai wouldnt follow and i ended up getting plummeted by two triceratops that wasnt fun to die and lose but nonetheless interesting graphicsvisual appealdespite the massive overhaul from orion horde to prelude there was not much change in the menu layout and character design pretty much every customisation requires you to buy for real money or earned by unlocking numerous achievements and the graphics are rather dated pixelated with its bad geometrical shapes the only thing that impressed me was the main menu background and thats about itin the game itself the developers have noticeably added the weather effect your screen will occasionally blur due to the snow and there is a consistent but annoying white border around your screen because of snow blowing on your face at least thats what i interpreted it as the added weather effects are appreciated and helps you to focus on the game however other than that first glance every other models such as the vehicles weapons et cetera are pretty much mediocre the text do not scale well with the resolution and exceeds the screen so the skill name and description is cut off for me and the border between the background and the text is not consistent skill icons are also exactly the same as when the game costed usd1500 before the overhaul to prelude which would have been fine if the icon were not extremely visually unappealing think of the icons as having secondary school or fresh college students not graduates drawing them its not simple enough to be simple or complex enough to be complex its just well the trailers dont show you the skill icons do they bugs there are some noticeable features that i cant really describe it as bug or glitch or whatsoever because i have no idea if they were meant to be a feature or a bug for example you are able to buy the same skill as many times as you want so long you have the credits from killing dinosaurs i have no idea whether buying the same skill again have any upgrades because the skill description remains exactly the same and there is no indication of current level or its just bugged and wasting my credits because even the skill icon colour everything else remains the same sometimes i am also spawned way way too far away from the base when i just started the campaign and have to activate the generator to start the game again i have no idea whether being spawned 400 metres away from your main and first base is a feature or a bug verdictby now youd probably wonder why the hell am i recommending this game after such negative experience and i have only 3 hours on record id say the game is actually worth that 100 if you have friends to play with its fun for a while and you could probably find some easter eggs here and there and explore the terrain the terrain is rather big but theres no sandbox option for me to explore so i cant rate the maps very accurately and ill leave it out from the gameplay part after all with dumb ai you cant do much albeit more than without ai however if you got no friends who will play this with you or cant seem to find one andor the game reverts to its original orion horde price of usd1500 id say skip it its seriously not fun playing alone i would have given this a mixed review if possible or else a bad review but for its price its hard to argue"
Super_Meat_Boy,"lem me tell ya somethin this game is stupid no not that stupid this is the qwop of medicine at the moment of this writing it is very short eight levels long with only three different procedures the last two are variations of the iconic heart transplant for someone that isnt adept at using their keyboard and dexterity this game is hard so basically if you arent prepared to take time to get better at this game dont buy it and dont badmouth it i think i paid full price for this and i am more than happy with it its hard but not unfairly hard like in Super_Meat_Boy or something like that the game gives you tools and tells you you need to do x now i found doing was the easy part i just had no idea how to do the procedures so overall this game is good for a laugh you feel great once you finish a procedure and it provides a unique control system to master if youre thinking about buying this game go ahead and do so if youre still not sure i think the demo is around online"

The_Community,"despite being 4yearold game i still think that this game is worth playing this game doesnt actually require much skill in fps so its a relatively simple game for starters except higher difficulties the gameplay is fascinating with the addition of melee weapons in addition go ahead and use mods to enhance your gameplay experience if you think the game is not cool enough visit the steam workshop or l4dmapscom to download and install your favourite mods made by The_Community if you are a new player i suggest playing single player before heading into multiplayer get used to the weapons and campaigns first once you have acquired those skills then head into multiplayer make some friends and enjoy be careful though there are malacious players out there teamkilling and ruining the game on purpose so try to avoid playing with those players anyway i would recommend playing this game if you are a fan of zombiekilling or firstperson shooter games"
Undertale,"alright grabbed the demo of the game liked it and finally bought this one for the full experienceUndertale may have a fair share of flaws in which i suck at explaining so im not going to say anything about em to save my hide but it is unique in its own right now i might spoil you a little bit of backstory or maybe a lot of backstory but ill try to keep it vague but you play as the eighth and last depending on how you play the game human who fell into the underground portion of a mountain thus the games namesake you find out whats going on down there and depending on your actions you either save an entire civilization of monsters or doom them along with yourselfthis game has a fresh take on roleplaying game experience as it offers options other than outright killing anyone who stands in your way you can choose to attack monsters in a battle or spare them many monsters need to be interacted with before you can let them go and sometimes this can be hard or inbetween you will meet some important characters along the way and whether they live through or die trying is up to you entirely Undertales system files remembers your actions throughout the game and if you make the right choices you will be lead to an ending that is satisfying even if its not for you it certainly is for the characters one wrong step though gives you a pandoras box effect remember the tale of pandora and a box in her possession this game basically applies the rules virtue brings fortune and many will die for the sins of oneif you havent played this game yet this may definitely be worth a try for you that is if rpgs are your thing i dont know about you but i have played this game and it gave me a mindblowing experienceso what are you waiting for if this game is your cup of tea grab it its worth every us dollar or whatever your native countrys currency is in my case its malaysian ringgit"

Garrys_Mod,"its a game i recommend for you but only to play with your friends as when you finish the story there is only some multiplayer modes left in there and so Garrys_Mod does not use alot of mods that need this game so buy it with your friends or dont buy it as you will exaust the single player aspect rather quickly"

Dont_Starve,"Dont_Starve is one of the best games i have played a great and fun game in both single and multiplayer dst it does eventually get boring but that is after one gets to day 200 i play offline so the hours dont record but getting to that stage is immensely difficult and the games cost is far less than the entertainment you will get playing it overall buy it and play it as you will likely enjoy it"

Tf2,"Tf2 is mixed with lots of differnet things and can give you infinite gameplay you got rocketjumping which is my persononal favourite surfteam deathmatchcapture the flag and playload thats just a couple of gamemode sections the main idea for some is to kill deathmatch capture the flag ect if you like gore this game is for you if you like capture the flag this game is for you if you like to learn new things such as surfing or rocketjumping that can come in handy during a real match then this game is for you if you like unreal powers and the chance to be invisible then this game is for you if you like a viroty of guns then this game is for you i 110 recomend you get this game the graphics are placed in a way that it makes it feel speical and exciting when someone has no idea where u r what your doing as a spy and as for rocketjumping and surfing something makes it feel so smooth and addictive you just constantly keep practicing and as it turns back you wont even know how good you really are the best you can do is take a look at others so i really do recomend you get this game its got ta be one of the best games in the store"

Terraria,"ill say that i like robots and that i like the wild west it has both so i cant complain steamworld dig is a great mining game with several influences such as terarria megaman and metroid you play as rusty who has inherited an old mine from his uncle the main objective is to mine collect ores sell them and reach for the bottem of the mine it was originally released on 3ds and the game is quite appealing to the eye they managed to add quite a bit of colour for a mining game which is nice the music is decent but i wouldnt say catchy it more melds right into the game which is great as it adds to the game the mining in the game is all about risk versus reward and it is done quite superblyoverall i give it 8510 its fun looks great and you can play the game in your own pace if youre not a big fan of games like minecraft or Terraria you should at least give this a go because for people like me it has a story and an ending plus the game has a bit to offer"
Sanctum_2,"velocity ultra is actually a hd version of velocity which is a shoot em uppuzzle game the story is about a blackhole coming to destroy a bunch of colonies and space stations and you as lietenant kai tana only realised the name halfway through the game are tasked with rescuing as many engineers scientists and colonists along with taking out some alien invaders taking advantage of the situation the story reminds me of Sanctum_2 as in its there but almost pointless and acts as a base setup but here it looks like they really tried expanding this games universe and its somewhat interesting so a for effort you take pilot of the quarp jet which lets you teleport to hard to reach places this shooter has some puzzles as well mainly deactivating powerstations its interesting and works for the most part you have your normal things like shooting aliens upgrades and such i like the cutscene images theyre very nice and detailed and the levels themselves are alright too music is okay it sets the mood but you wont be tapping your toes to anything the game contains a story mode with 50 missions leaderboards and a flight computer which has various things to offer such as concept art unlocks minigames a calculator and minesweeper whatstill this game is very good it wont rock your boat but thats fine its a nice little shooter game to have fun with occasionally it has a couple of cool tricks too and uses them well enough im not sure if the sequal is any good but now i got ta give it a try someday this game gets a 7510"

The_Community,"the alpha of h1z1 was off to a very rocky start the game was absolutely riddled with bugs rendering it almost unplayable and to make it worse we found out that while soe had said that the only buyable objects would be cosmetic we later found out that this was not the case every person on the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit server with a couple of bucks to spare was calling in an air drop giving them guns tools and food so that they would have a major advantage over the competition but luckily those days are far behind us thanks to one of the best alpha development teams i have ever experienced they listen to what everyone in The_Community says most bugs are fixed within a day of them being reported and the rest they choose to keep working on full bore until they are fixed and i must say thank god they fixed the air drops air drops are now easily able to be seen by whoever is in your corner of the map the range in which they are dropped is far greater meaning that as opposed to you buy an air drop and you get it you are instead having to compete with a barrage of other players for your prize and finally the drop rate of things like guns and other weapons in an air drop has been dramatically reduced so that they won ' t set you to far ahead of the competition this has all helped to turn the game into a far more playable and enjoyable alphaif you want to get an idea of what the game might be like then just picture this day z but made by a far greater team with superior skill and coding knowledge who will in turn choose to listen to what their players ask for and fix every bug that crops up this game is how day z should have been the forest could have been and rust will never bei must put this out there this game is the most fun that i have ever had in an alpha or even a beta for that matter and i am putting that down to the wonderful team of devs behind itthe animations though only in alpha are beautiful and fluid there is a smooth transaction between different actions and a polished look to them normally only seen in finished games the graphics while not that bad could definitely use some texture updates before the final release of the game as they are currently looking a few years behind schedule but that is only expected in an alpha and finally i must just put it out there to all you gaming bullet fans that this is currently the most polished and enjoyable alpha on the steam market and thanks to some beautiful optimization it is playable on most average systems but never fear if you are currently strapped for cash but wish you could still play the game it will be free to play to the general public upon final releaseone thing that i have currently forgotten to mention is the beautiful design of the games ai zombies are as dumb as they should be and not much of a problem alone but are attracted to things such as sound meaning if you fire a gun at the wrong moment you could have a pack of as large as fifty zombies hunting you down at once which can cause quite a problem the way they have designed and built this ai really impressed me they act exactly as you would imagine a zombie should dumb and only a problem in numbers and this ai design has carried over to other creatures found in the game world from skittish deers to ferocious wolves ready to attack anything in their sight and terrifying bears who once locked onto you are probably some of the most dangerous creatures in the gamethe combat in this game has been beautifully designed the actions are smooth and you are actually able to feel the power as you send a fist flying into a zombies head as they send a hand back flying towards you the weapons while in most cases rare are very powerful and will give you a huge advantage over the competition while items such as combat knives and machetes will give you the upper hand in close quarters combat a bullet from any of the guns can be absolutely devastating but remember that a gunshot can be heard miles away so be careful not to attract the horde or worse another human hungry for your bloodso have i enjoyed h1z1 in the two short weeks this game has been out it has come so very far from the buggy pay to win mess it once was to the beautifully polished and enjoyable alpha it is today i must say that it is hands down the most enjoyable alpha or even beta that i have ever played it has been twenty dollars well spent and all thanks to the amazing team of helpful and responsive devs creating it i would strongly advise any of you zombie or survival fans out there to give this work of art a try and all that i am left to say is that i can honestly not wait for the next big update and eventually the final release of the game soe you have really outdone yourself this timecheck out more reviews and previews at gamingbulletcom"

The_Community,"ive only played 30 hours of this and quite frankly it is spectacular it does require some hefty hardware to play the game maxed out as anyone would expect from a game with a great physics engine but you will enjoy it i wrote this review just after the exploration release and it has advanced space engineers alot faster than any other games in terms of development in an alpha stage thanks to the great developers they truly connect with The_Community and the modding side is easy to use the ui can be a bit tough to use at first but after a while you will get used to it this is my dream game and i look forward to seeing it progress and so far it has done a great job in fulfilling my dream"

Nether,"this is an excellent survival horror game as it manages to keep a suspensful atmosphere throughout your experience and manages to create a very realistic postapocalyptic city by uitilizing the use of shrubbery broken building crashed helicopters masses of derelict weather damaged cars as well as of course the players who mostly seem to be very paranoid towards eachother as well as very distrustful this greatly helps to create a tense and frightening atmosphere in which the players survive and one final thing the Nether of course they are not only scary as crap in appearance but they can also teleport and are extremely powerful depending on the variety speaking of which there are many all of these assets greatly help to create a great survival horror experience for the Nether game ps it is still in alpha so there will be a few bugs"
The_Community,"the pay2win level of this game is just it can be played casually and without investing any money in it but then you would be at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that you have weapons that barely match theirsi honestly tried to get to the max level but every time they updated the level cap would just increase and the fact that you rank up too slowly without the exp multiplier that the premium players get just forced me to play this game for hours on endi eventually stopped at rank 100 the max rank is probably 235 by nowthe games matchmaking system is purely unbalanced if youre a bronze threat playeryou basically get treated like dirt and get matched up against goldies and also the backup that you get usually doesnt match the power that the opposition has unless of course you roll with a clan thats filled with 150 ranked silvers and goldiesbut then again there are some actually decent people that actually have skill in playing this its just a bit sad that The_Community is just but still i would recommend it with friends and also dont take this game too seriously"

Team_Fortress_2,"counterstrike global offensive is the latest installment in the counterstrike series nothing much has changed in this installment other than updated graphics veterans to the series are going to love counterstrike global offensive but newcomers sadly i can not guarantee that you will like this game even if you know you like the game the very difficult learning curve might get to you before you even have a chance to completely enjoy the game but its worth giving the game a shot to some its too old school and it lacks features the new flashy modern first person shooters have ads aim down sights sprint etc but in my opinion this one of the greatest fps out on the market what most fps lack is a sense of competitve nature sure you can make bets and cmon bro 1v1 me bro ill smash you people but in my opinion its not enough if you love competitve gaming particually in fps then theres another point to counterstrike there are so many things that make counterstrike global offensive a worthy game in your steam game library for me to list so do me a favor do the counterstrike community a favor and pick up this game for around 1500 au dont know how much in other currencies im sure you can do the math youre getting a good deal operations which are like free dlc updates but have limited time on playing the maps that are released in the operation skins which are probably the most infectious disease in a game second to the infamous Team_Fortress_2 hats and overall just fun u2late approves dnotes sorry if there are grammar and spelling mistakes i typed this up without checking for errors sorry grammar nazis p like this up if you found it useful so others can see have fun"
Evolve,"planetside 2 is a mind blowing game from its massive maps massive player count epic graphics and its intense and addicting gameplay its class based and rEvolves around team work the objective of the game is to capture all the regions on one continent overall there are 3 continents to choose from but the continent indar seems to be the most popular i recommend this game to veterans to the genre as newcomers to the genre will feel frustrated planetside 2 is no casual game its a competitive one"

Portal,"with the Portal games being one of the most popular action puzzle series in history the new indie release aperture tag had a lot to live up to in several respects both original games showcased a unique futuristic soundtrack difficult puzzles and of course the memorable commentary of one special ai that has a place in all of our heartsaperture tag ticks these boxes but not as well as the original series did of course being an indie title i should cut it some slack the game has a great overall soundtrack which hardly differs from the originals in style keeping the ominous electronic feel which all players of the original relate to solving puzzles with listening to it as i write thisthe puzzles themselves are well crafted and make good use of the new device we hold in painter chells hands check out her model in one of the tests involving Portals including several race track themed courses which rely on reaction time to pass and others which have a series of walls and levels which are needed to bouce and run off of to continuethe only ingredient this game seemed to miss from the delicious cake this series is was its ai character nigel a personality core running his first test with you though the game didnt attempt to compete with glad0s it lacked in overall comedic value which i remember the first two games for havingthis game is great for an indie release attempting to prequelsequel the other two games which will always be a difficult thing to do its soundtrack and puzzles are on Portal point and as much as nigel is a lovable orb of metal he didnt cut it for me i missed glad0s and her odd ramblings attempts to kill me and her unique personality i am yet to try out the cooperative and map creation modes featured in this game but am glad i purchased this and thoroughly enjoyed playing it"
Super_Meat_Boy,"not only is this movie an inspiring documentary about several of the best indie developers out there but its an hour and a half long journey which you take as a viewer with the people that are in it becoming truly sympathetic for their hardships and joyful for their successesthis film is overall engaging and informative and i dont think i can say enough positive feedback to get my point across but ill try telling the story of the developers of three different indie games braid fez and Super_Meat_Boy during which you watch the production of the game the struggles and the achievments along the way as well as how stepping into such a large project affects their social lives relationships health and day to day routines and really gives you a good idea of how hard indie devs work to produce the games they dothe movie is super enjoyable to watch has a great soundtrack and has won a bunch of awards so please just buy it and watch it because you wont regret experiencing what you do while watching this serious"
Evolve,"evoland when asked to sum it up i would say is fairly hard to do it is a great indie game that changes Evolves and develops as you play it starting as a black and white 2d adventure game like the original legend of zelda and developing into a fully coloured 3d free roam adventure rpg more like final fantasy the game is enjoyable short and funny and has a great soundtrack i would definitely recomend this game to lovers of old adventure games and whom want to relive their history and all the changes they have gone through to become what they are todaythanks for reading jazza"

Half_Life_2,"okay how should i say this omg its one of the most exciting zombie video games of all timeno more room in hell was a multiplayerbased Half_Life_2 mod that was released in 2011 which has been in development nearly 7 years the game has been released on steam in 2013 as a full game and that means steam users dont need Half_Life_2 to play the gamethe game has two modes an objectivebased mode and a survival mode the objectivebased is a simple point to point level which needs players to fight hordes of zombies in their way while theyre going to the main objective while the survival mode puts players in a scenario which players have to survive and kill some waves of hungry zombiesthere are three types of zombies normal flesheating romerotype walker zombies running zombies and children zombiesyou can also have the ability to play the game in single player mode just go to the create server menu with no other players and just dive in into the gamethe games tense and dark atmosphere made the games very fun and scary to explore especially if you wander alone like a lost explorer most maps are pretty dark so you need flashlight to explore the games levels you can also use a lighter but it can only lights a bit of an areaweapons in this game are pretty badass from pistols to smgs knives to machetes baseball bats to sledgehammers and semiautomatic rifles to shotguns the game also have some types of ammo which firearms with a same ammo type can be used however there are still some flaws in this game which sometimes made the experience a little bit boring and annoying one of em is the stiff wooden and unrealistic character animations the lack of body deformation features on zombies the lack of allied bot support on single player mode and the depiction of children zombies there are also no extra game modes other than the objective and survival modes and the fact that the game didnt have some character and weapons customization featuresstill it is one of the most exciting and scariest zombie survival video games of all time i gave nmrih 8710"

The_Community,"this game continues with many of the features that have been entering the game in past few years one of the major changes in this game is that you need to contract with sponsors to maintain your team this being that your team and all other teams change each year possibly even 5times in 5 years this change increases the game play in my opinion other than that The_Community updates and modifications upgrade the game greatly by adding a larger number of teams variants and the like of course there is always the occassional result which is unlikely to happen such as a 55mountain climber winning major mountain stagesoverall this game series improves each year"

Evolve,"one of the mmorpgs i am still playing to this day though i do not fervently pursue every inch and corner of this particular game it arguably has proven itself a very difficult game to drop as a result of events and decent actionto speak about this game in more particular detail you would not discover a game filled to the brinks with story and lore you are a lone warrior of a long forgotten race under the order and jurisdiction of one particular woman who calls herself lotus the tutorial will give you a glimpse of the story until you are given your own ship where the story boils down to sweet fa because except quests that gives you warframes and event plot lines all you would be left doing is finding more warframes weapons blueprints mods and materials so you can craft them grind them and use them in your quest of discovering more warframes weapons blueprints mods and materials you can also throw your own clans development progress and the contributions you can make towards a game faction into it as well adding more time to this particular grindfestso why would i even recommend this game well because the action doesnt disappoint though the sweet satisfaction of completing and fully modifying and tricking out your weapons and warframe of choice is mostly rewarded just by a greater statistical number the complete and total decimation of your enemies is sure to bring a happy smile on any action genre enthusiasts with bloodied and pretty gory corpses to boot optional as you can be sure you are the one that led to their complete and utter mutilationthe boss battle is usually hit or miss with bosses that are simply bullet sponges to bosses that requires a little bit more finesse like bosses that teleports and bosses who only intakes damage in certain areas normally you wouldnt have any gripes with more difficult bosses but when you are grinding for a specific part for something you want and the random number generator have forsaken you in dropping the loot you desire over and over i think you would grow to hate such technicalities that serve no other purpose than stopping you from getting that sweet four barreled shotgunthere is currently a total of 23 warframes available ingame with harder better faster stronger version of some frames available for grinding already if there is a particular suit you like you might just be able to grab a even spiffier version of it every suit does indeed come with 4 unique abilities of its own and is highly customisable in terms of cosmetics and specific combat capabilities and parameters every grindable gear equipment or companion caps out at level 30 with 8 slots for mods collectible cards that improve stats or utility in someway each item total theres more stuff out there then i would care to mention but youd find out if you play it no just know it probably means more grinding better damages and maybe just your own personal pet dog that and maybe space combat with you in a suit that can fly but hey i find that to be more of a gimmick in comparison to me pinning a wave of enemies under one powerful arrow as their mid sections split separating their body parts into two halves with their decapitated torsos nailed to the wall all from just one well placed shot from my bowyou have three slots for weaponries a primary slot for your power hungry dreams like snipers assault rifles shotguns or even bows a secondary slot for that dualwielding fantasy of yours or maybe just having to use something because you ran out of primary ammo we are talking dual rEvolvers pistols shurikens ninja stars and automatic repeaters lastly whats a ninja without a melee weapon pick something traditional like a katana a claymore or a long sword or go ham with electronic whips wolverine claws and grim reaper scythesfrankly none of that will drag you into the game more than a mate and a growing clan that needs your attention because of all the exclusive weaponries in it game factions because of their unique weapons and cosmetics but more importantly the timed events that will give you stronger versions of grindable mods and weapons you can feel pretty left out with out those stuff but then there is the free trade market in game that will let you grab those stuff you cant grind for anymore at least for awhile for real actual money because there is always someone selling if you are patient enoughif someone tells you all of the stuff in this game is grindable that isnt technically true because there are certain things that havent seen the light of day ever since a certain time period you have event mods and weapons that are ungrindable outside of events originally grindable stuff taking out of the maps they can be obtained from stuff being retired from the game completely at certain points and if you really care for it unique cosmetics that are sold in real money bundlesthis is why i consider this game to be borderline addictive you are forced to revisit this game from time to time because the game refuses to let you go with its consistent weapon warframe and event updates with stuff being retired made rarer and exclusive by different varying circumstancesbut then neither will you let go of it completely because you know that friend of yours is quite keen to see just how much damage that fully customised weapons of yours do and youd be happy to oblige himother things ive neglected to mentionpotentially excellent graphics with a decent computerfour man cooperation gameplay all around with specific eight man maps out and some more in developmentpvpclan alliances and being able to take certain areas under your jurisdiction while being able to tax those who run missions on it"

Csgo,"basic gameplayyou play as either a counterterrorist or a terrorist both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choiceyou can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot youon the terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm important boxesanyway once plant wait you patiently for it to explodeas a counterterrorist you must eliminate all the terrorist forces or defuse the bomb thus protecting those ever important boxes from certain destructionbeing a honourable opponent terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the cts the chance to slaughter the remaining ts and defuse the bombill list some positivenegative attributes of this game herepositive attributes matchmaking teaches children the harsh reality of gambling although some never seem to learn even after 500 later ranks cool looking skins fast growing population of players fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often chickens high replay value deathmatch game type i could go into more detail on negative parts of it but that would make this review too long and boringnegative attributes although i do love the single player campaign it could use some work i really wish it were longer and that final boss fight is pretty lame it only lasts around 27 seconds and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you and how his 7 year old could beat you blindfolded the game mode infernal played on the map deinfernosome people like this game mode however i personally dislike it for those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it ill explain for youit seems like any normal de map however the real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego normally its hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map and has the ability to shiftmove around to different locations or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time demolition also known as jokemode added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every april fools day however some hacker probably that 4chan guy permanently unlocked it volvo have been working on a fix ever sincedemolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents also no block is enabled and whoa so is team killingthe volka strategyyou could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins or you could play the game correctly like me here is my strategy dont buy skins to start with seriously its a waste of money play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get wait for a steam sale and invest in as many copies of Csgo you can work your way up to about 5 copies or so but make sure you dont get too many otherwise you wont have enough time to harvest all your Csgo account drops having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns note it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have remember to never gamble with opening cases ive made about 100 with this method i think its about time to quit my day jobin a whole i do love this game and would recommend to anyone good half good half"

Tf2,"kills time got it for the Tf2 hat still had a load of fun"
The_Community,"i havent gotten all the achievements and there i didnt read each and every entry yet so my full experience has yet to be complete but i can review this with confidence regardlessthis game is amazing i can not begin to describe how enjoyable i found it from the voice acting to the scenery its utterly immersive but ill go through individually to break it downthe gameplay this game features a first or third person perspective while you go about solving puzzles for things called sigils this is the core mechanic of the game you must collect these to advance which means you must solve the puzzles and frankly speaking it was very enjoyable i found the puzzles were not overly tricky and most involve some planning ahead but at no point was i dreading going to the next puzzle it never got stale so if you do puzzles then youll enjoy this game off of that alone however that is not the only thing this game is about the talos principle is a philosophical adventure as well you are continuously guided by a deep voice called elohim and he openly states that he is the maintainer and creator of the world youre in and that you must go along as per his wishes to trancend to heaven this however is met with an issue when you discover another personentity on the computers found in every level named milton or as he is referred to by elohim the serpent as you progress milton will continuously press you with really challenging and thought provoking questions and this is where this game really hooked me i literally found myself battling with flaws in my ways of thinking its so mind tripping and intense and i love it if you enjoy these things then you will also like the gamesoundtrack the sounds in this game are really scenic and help solidify the mood of the various worlds it will at times intensify during intermission worlds such as the a b and c buildings and at other times mellow out such as during a few of the puzzles it very effectively immersifies as well by simulating environments such as birds chirping with a waterfall while playing slow deep based music to really get a calm feeling seeping into the player i was thoroughly pleased with the use of sounds in this game especially because you can play at your own place and i found myself just stopping and looking around nice and slowly at times to really enjoy this game sceneryasthetics holy hell this game was amazing with its looks granted at times my computer would start buffering because it was on ultra i found that even on high i was just completely immersed and mesmerised by the scenery it features a realatively large closed in map in all the worlds and the look is very convincing to the point where you go to a place where a messenger is and it was just beautiful easily one of my favorite places story i will not be doing any spoilers or anything there are 3 endings ive done 2 of them with the last one not being done being the easiest to accomplish cough basic completion and i found myself disappointed when it ended yet completely satisfied with the endings this games quarrels between elohim and milton quite apparently mirrors the god vs devil kind of storyline but rather than telling the player who is good or who is bad we are tasked with trusting our instincts and coming to our own conclusions throughout the game as well we see many qr codes which are translated into messages these messages are from other sigil seekers and they show the very different outlooks people may have when faced with such a situation as either scepticism or complacency this game has a simple plot overall of that there is no doubt but its the characters and interactions with the environment that make this game great ive left this segment seperate but this is also part of the story you will find audio files these files depict one alexander drennan a person who shares her thoughts on the outlook of the world human beings and our creations she touches on some deep and maybe depressing topics but she does so effectively she very much is in my opinion one of the most immersive and enjoyable aspects of the game the voice actor erin fitzgerald did an amazing job voicing her and we learn the means that built up to the talos principle i will not diverge into it as i think thats part of the enjoyment and what builds a drive to find all the files and information cons there are things in the game called stars they are what they sound like golden stars these things are hidden in almost every level of every hub world 73 there are 30 in total 3 are found in the main transistional world where the tower lays these things are heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t im not even joking had i not looked up a tutorial to find them all i would never have found them you have to do the most heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t things interact multiple puzzles with each other find hidden passages ladders and switches and frankly its just tedious through the stars you unlock 3 worlds these worlds have 9 sigils in total that are needed for the secret ending i very much dislike how heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing hidden and annoying they are i didnt even know there were so many stars needed until about halfway through honestly a drag you will need a guide for this its a bit short a game if youre only here for puzzles then you will have such a short playthrough the only reason i have 20 hours on record is due to doing everything with the exception of a few acheivements this by no means stops it from being a great game it really is i would buy this full price just be wary that if you truly want to draw everythign out of the game take it slow otherwise you will probably be disappointedof all of the games ive enjoyed this game is damn near the top i give it a 910 easy i look forward to the dlc when i can afford itedit ive just completed the dlc road to gehenna it is beautiful in its own way it has the same atmosphere as the vanilla game and obviously still has puzzles and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t stars but it also touches on a more existenal take seeing many characters trapped in elohims prison going through all the messages on the boards reading what they have and The_Community theyve built it really does show how society can really becomes this entangled mess i wouldnt say it had the same impact as the vanilla which i believe is due to the lack of voice over erin fitzgerald truley made the game a massive experience for me and it definitely didnt touch much on the same existenal crisis that the vanilla did in my opinion it was by no means disappointing but if i hadnt have been so invested into the story of the vanilla that i got all the endings but the basic then i dont think the dlc at full price i got it during discount would have been worth it in my opinion i think the vanilla is the main meat of it and the dlc wraps it in a nice little bow overall this game is phenomenal and i can not stress that it will forever have a place in my heart and recommendation list"
Portal,"this is one of the most legitimate mods ive ever seen hands down Portal stories mel is simply a yes if you finished Portal 2 and you need a new story and puzzle there will be no tutorials unlike Portal 2 and youll start with all the elements thrown at you in the beginning so i recommend if you finish Portal 2 firstbe warned though the puzzles are mostly hard and you will need to think more outside the box to figure it out but it will be very satisfying once you solve it so gear up youre in for some frustration and a whole bunch of thinking with Portals all over again oh and also the mod has all that you expect valve quality so dont worry about it youll be fascinated for science"

Nether,"firstly before i get any hate i know this game is in early access but the game so far is very laggy loot barely spawns and when you do find something decent you will probably be shot by another player in one of the taller buildings or you will be killed by the teleporting Nethers i honestly wanted this game to be good the concept is cool the monsters are scary but the developers didnt quite pull it off what you are paying into isa paytowin style gamea lagfestscenery that looks like it was made by a five yearoldat the moment i cant recommend this game it is fun to play with a friend for a couple of hours but it gets very boring after a while save up another 510 and buy a game which is more stable and fun like dayz or rust310"

Undertale,"when games become a expirience it exceeds all expectation and fairnessUndertale is a innovative jrpg with a lot of heart and love the concept of Undertale is the battle system the battle system spins the generic overused reference of a battle system which was pioneered by final fantasy and makes it ironic in Undertale you have the ability to talk with your enemies instead of fighting them this leads into some very interesting gameplay that never gets old trying to find the correct option to talk them out of battle is puzzle like and you feel very accomplished when you advance the battle through talking if talking isnt your thing you can slash your enemies to death just like every other jrpg out there the games charm is just heartwarming its filled with so many things that can make you laugh make you determined make you disturbed by the occasional chilling atmosphere its litterally a rollercoaster of many different emotions the little secrets and references show how effort went into this these secrets didnt even have to be in the game but they are there and adds so much heart the story has a simple setting of you are a human child who falls down into the underground where its filled with monsters who have been banished there by humans its a simple story and the opening prologue resembles that of a nes game but the plot darkens and goes even further beyond apparently Undertales main inspiration is earthbound mother and for a person who has not played earthbound can definitely see it the graphics the music is god like its all catchy and atmospheric its a real highlight of the gamein conclusionUndertale is a short innovative expirience that can touch your heart with its charm and is worth the 10 pls play itif i had any problems with it it would be its length its about 511 hour game depending on what you know and the world could have been so much more then the very limited amount of locations but this minor dislike gets ruled out when you realise its an indie game that was mostly made by one toby fox so of course the game isnt going to be hugeanyway just click add to cart and play"

Portal,"whilst at first i intentionally held off from purchasing this game as many of my friends did not have it and the fact that its prior incarnation decided to wipe itself of save files several times i decided to take the plunge into borderlands 2 when two other friends decided to purchase it during a steam sale since then there has been no regret to buying this product the graphics have greatly improved the gameplay is tighter and faster paced and the humour is nearly original Portal level in my opinion with lots of clever quips and references that you have to really see and search forthere is one thing however that must be though of when purchasing this make sure you have a friend to play it with because as with any game that requires a bit of grinding a friend goes a long way to seperating boredom from adventures into hilaritya geniunely good game if you do not mind the occasional what the heck moments from enemies"

The_Community,"valve is a very generous company to release free professional standard animating software that has created many oppertunies among us The_Community to dive into more than just the game i admit it can be very confusing and almost daunting for new comers of sfm but once you get your head wrapped around the basics you can get straight into the more complex areas it provides people like me borderline broke a source of creative software which isnt a scam or disgustingly cheap thank you valve i reccomend this"

Evolve,"verdun is a tactical ww1 fps with an emphasis on teamwork revolving around 4 man squads the gameplay and visual style of the game is similiar to red orchestra 2rising storm although there are several unique elements involving trench based combat and some unorthodox class loadouts get used to using handguns and rEvolvers which are quite handy in some circumstances getting your head around these unique elements might take a few hours and youll probably die a lot much like the real inexperienced soldiers of ww1 but after gaining a bit of experience verdun is a very exciting and rewarding gaming experiencehighly recommended unless you suck at games"

Css,"i bought this game almost a year ago and i will now show my thoughts and feelings towards this game i never played 16 but i played something like 48 hours of Css the beauty of the game is how much more simpler and to the point it is no kill streaks you have to constantly worry about being destroyed by and no perks which can make games very uneven everything is just available to you as soon as you download it the only purchasable items give you no advantage and are simply just cosmetic items which some people will go in great lengths to collect gathering an inventory of up 10k i played the casual game mode for the first 24 hours of the game and then finally hopped in matchmaking where you are given a rank after 10 games you only get matched up with people around the same skill level as you which is great unlike other games where you get destroyed until you manage to gather enough skill to fight backthere are some hackers in this game who try to hide that but often they eventually get banned by vac or overwatch which is a thing in the game which gives experienced players the chance to watch games where players think the suspect was hacking to which they then choose a verdictthe game is good for veterans and newbies alike as gun play and movement has since been changed since older titles overall the game is a must buy for anyone into competitive first person shooters and the great thing being that i have earned the 15 back just from getting and selling items that randomly dropped in game for me its wonderful1010 without some heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit 1 line joke review"

The_Community,"i never really heard of it and boy i should havemy friends reccomended it when we were looking for a cooperative shooter to playmy god i love this gameheres the scenario youve been stranded on a zombieinfested island and your goal is to survive pretty simple at first until you relize everything is very limited your first gun might have 2 bullets in the clip this makes finding melee weapons like axes or sledgehammers very lucky The_Community varies once your with a group of friendly people and the next thing your surrounded by bandits and taken hostagethis game looked really simple on the outside but when you play a rough hour of it you will start to notice how immersive the game can feelthere will also be scenarios where you have to make a hard decision the game does not script that this will happen in any way possible will you go to the town and look for supplies will you abbandonn your friend to the zombies and make an escape will you eat the moldy corn and risk infectionthe choice is yours and it can and will impact on what happens afterhowever the game does have some downsides which might not be a big problemthe shadows and details can sometimes screw my pc around esspecialy if you have skype onsometimes the game can break by not spawning items properly like once the only things i could find in a town is moldy corn and clips i restarted the game and everything was fine there were clothes notes bows and everything else you might find in a postapocalyptic townthe respawn time does not exsist in this game once you die you can quickly sprint back into the game and hope for something different to happenout of all games i had not found such a zombie survival like this one aside from dayz of course9510"

The_Community,"state of decay is an open world zombie apocalypse survival simulation made by a smaller studio as such some gameplay ideas are not as well formed as they could be and some bugs persist despite ongoing updates support perhaps the studios vision is slightly greater than their grasp but the support to date has been great and most major issues have been addressed aside from few nigglesof note the simulation aspect means that characters in your group will take the initiative do things for themselves however the ai is probably not quite up to scratch in handling some of the micro associated with this clever macro idea if you just dont like any loss of control at all even when your machine is off then this may annoy you a lot however is is reasonably unobtrusive and does add a degree of simgamelike satisfaction if your community is happy and well supplied then it will tick along nicely the inverse is also true and there are endless opportunities for player agency to influence The_Communitys state the game answers your questions about how zoey and the team from left 4 dead stay so well fed and where exactly those grenade launchers come from it is engaging well thought out and likely to continue to be tweaked and refinedit reminds me of stalker l4d fallout tactics if that helps highly recommended"
Dont_Starve,"honestly this is probably the most well put together early access game ive ever seen and klei deserve every cent of your money for it you wont run out of things to do see and create in a very broad sense Dont_Starve is comparable to minecraft on ketamine"
Evolve,"this game is great for fans of the original alien movie and stealth game fansi have played this through on hard and i can say the ai is as good as they say i have had to deal with a lot of bad ai and bad ai is worse when you are in a stealth game the alien is random or " sudo random " as programing usually is it does patrol in different areas but it is not as ridged as the patrols of as say the hitman games in one example i decided to follow it so i would know where it was and not bump into it unfortunately it stopped and decided to turn around and back track dead reload i then started to base movement on hiding spots i rated lockers as medium since the alien more often sniffs them out and you lose health while holding your breath at the top i had well positioned tables with no line of sight to doors i had a premo spot that was behind a reception desk in a corner i thought this was safe...wrong the alien walked by a few times while waited to time my move to the next room and it decided it hadn ' t checked my hiding spot and walked around the desk and peeked under dead reloadas for the many many bad reviews i have read listing " plot holes " all i can say is if you have not watched alien with directors commentary and seen the cut scenes then you have no idea about the alien universe and should not be commenting on them from the start this game has been a homage to the original movie not aliens or alien 3 you don ' t get the whole picture you are just an average wy engineer stuck in a mess your main priority is getting off the station not figuring out the how and the why you get snippets of that along the way but mainly you just don ' t want to dieminor spoiler alert hint no details but you ' ll get some of the plot aside from my points above the ambiguity of the alien life cycle in this game can be explained if you have ever watched any documentaries on bees and how sister bees are ' supressed ' chemically it becomes viable for sister bees to start reproducing when not being supressed by a queen check out this bbc link for more info httpwwbbccouknature17854061 without spoiling the plot too much this game can tie in to the originals and can expand on it without interfering with the trilogy canon i do not recognise resurrection as a movie i am in denial it never happened la la la lathe game does have some bugs and slightly annoying dynamics floating rEvolvers rEvolvers that you can ' t pick up as it is a scripted event or the lack of any jumping ability oh look small boxes are blocking my path oh well i can ' t jump over them also painfully slow access to terminals and hacking i would start a hack only to hear the alien drop from a nearby vent frantically i ' d try to cancel the hack and it would take forever if i was in that position i would drop what i was doing and f off quick smartthis game has potential for expansion on an open station theme i would have liked to see a game mode that started you out on the station before the alien starts killing people it would have been like a game of last man standing you station npcs are trying to survive as long as possible and you can access all parts of the station with the right tools said tools can be accessed from the start and not in story stages like the campaignoverall i think alien isolation is an excellent game with a great amount thought put into a classic alien story line the environments are polished characters are very detailed and voiced acted very well also even after my first play though i am still hiding under desks and in lockers refusing come out the game should be called locker simulator"
Tf2,"i have no idea how to play poker but this game is awesome the best 250 i spent at the christmas salesthe banter between characters is awesome and the Tf2 unlocks are nice achievement items only not tradableif you play Tf2 get this game especially if you are a heavy fan also recomend this as a my first poker game if you want to learn to play poker by trial and errorvery nice to play"
Tf2,"this game used to be epic not anymore infact not for a long time now too many little kids and f2p players acting like jerks and swearing over the mic or in the chat box i play video games to meet new friends and have fun and this game is not fun anymore nothing seems to be done about the poor behaviour either as its has gotten progressivley worse over the last few months especially on official mvm servers making this game f2p has killed it sorry killed it for me if they make an update where the premium players dont have to deal with the f2p riff raff and make age restricted servers ill come back if not sorry valve you have lost a customer its not worth the stress and anger and urge anyone who considers playing this game to be wary of the disgusting behaviours by players or avoid this game for a bit i know valve will sort this out eventually as they are a great company please make Tf2 and enjoyable experience again"
Tf2,"i cant play Tf2 becuase of one of the update now any time i want to play Tf2 i get the blue tv of death ps yes i use a tv to play games"
Team_Fortress_2,"an extremely fun game with hints of a call of duty playstyle and Team_Fortress_2 wackiness the balance of the two styles makes the game unique giving the feel of a competitive game that doesnt take itself seriously i recommend this game to any lovers of first person shooters however this game does come with its fair share of issuesthe matchmaking issues are present making it seem as if there arent any players online as i am in australia i had to change my steam download region to us chicago to have any hopes of playinga seeming lack of dedicated servers seem present as the game most of the time assigns a host for the matches making gameplay very laggy at timesthis aside gotham city impostors is still a very solid game that needs an equally solid community to keep it alivei still however recommend this game"
Garrys_Mod,"a lot of fun spending endless hours exploring mining and crafting do whatever you want with whoever you want whenever you want the best sandbox game since Garrys_Mod"

Csgo,"even cod comes up with new concepts every few years or soCsgo doesnt feel like a new game it feels like counter strike it hasnt changed much some people may like that but if you are a person that doesnt play 1 game for 10 years then you will probably be underwhelmed verdict if you have never played cs then you can get it if you played previous version of cs you may get bored"
Tf2,"i waited a long time to buy this i played cs for years back when going to a lan cafe and paying by the hour was still a thing then years went by and despite having css in my library i never really went back to it i was happy with Tf2 and payday 2 for all my shooter needs then steam sales and whatnot happened and after reading about 50 steam reviews i decided what the heck and bought it5 hours in and im very happy i did csgo has planted a bomb at site a my heart i dont know if that metaphor works but yes i was surprised i played a bit of casual before taking a deep breath and jumping into a comp matchwow such fun i wasnt flamed for being awful i was playing with people with dozens and hundreds of hours on their cs clock and still managing to be slightly better than completely uselessand now with all this Tf2 style unlockable heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit which i am a complete sucker for and a variety of challenged and whatnot this game now has a place on my coverted favourites highly recommend even at full price 15 its a great deal cheaper than cod or bf and i would argue better in many ways get on it"

Portal,"simply amazing at first you think its a puzzlemaze game akin to Portal but it has the richness of a storyline like myst you gain more knowledge about the world youre in as you progress through the game and you find youre stuck wanting to learn more very addicting im pretty stupid and even i could work out most puzzles myself"
Loadout,"sweet mother of christthis game somehow manages to be visceral while also making you play in a methodical tactical manner its understated and yet bombastic at the same timesimply put play premade campaign maps to acquire money use that money to purchase pilots vehicles mechtanks weapons and semiprocedural missions then mix and match for huge replay value in the freelance mode its a super simple careeresque formula that feels like an arcade version of mechwarrior mercenaries and i love itnote i say career mode but it really isnt that deep dont expect a management game herecombat is satisfying and varied due to the wild Loadout combinations you can create fast light mechs with heavy weapons giant slow walkers with enough dakka to put the greenskins to shame and any variation in between i personally recommend the fork mech with dual disco turrets example herethe game is not easy but at no point does it feel unfair it can be difficult to get the hang of aiming at first but all the projectile arc information really is right there in front of you so it doesnt take long to figure out as long as you dont rush in and try to take on swarms of enemies all at once you should be good just like mechwarrior online this is a form of cover shooter sneak behind buildings and only engage when youve got the advantage and speaking of buildings everything is destructible and i mean everythingin conclusion its a simple isometric mechtank action game with some light customisation fully destructible environments and a great synthwave soundtrack recommended"
Tf2,"a very entertaining sandbox game perfect for anyone wanting to mod or create cool things with the halflife objects or just heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit aroundhowever i highly recommend you get css Tf2 and maybe the two halflife 2 episodes ot get the most out of it since many servers will use stuff from the above especially css weapons even if you dont though its still very fun to play get it nao"

Terraria,"interested in seeing some gameplay see belowhttpsyoutubeooqb1ef84ctldr cheap but fun roguelike survival game some way to go before its finished but well worth the price with the current content 7510 review rogue harvest is a roguelike survival game with permadeath and gameplay similar to that of hardcore minecraft or Terraria in rogue harvest you play as the survivor of a plane crash fighting to make sense of and survive in the hostile world in which hes found himself the gameplay is fun and currently semideep theres several tiers of content for each item from 24 depending on the item and you are free to create some awesome looking houses to defend yourself with pros graphically the game is beautiful enemies look super cool build system is intuitive and fun procedurally generated terrain allows for interesting gameplay between playthroughs cons audio can become repetitive procedural generation can screw you in the early game i got killed by a high level monster upon spawning in my first world early access can always be a gamble although this game seems to have a good track record so far conclusion graphics 810the graphics for this game are beautiful the enemies are varied and interesting to look at and the buildings look cool when finishedaudio 710the audio is nice at first and matches the game world well but feels repetitive and can get annoying after a whilegameplay 7510the gameplay is fun and interesting similar to most games of this genre there could be more tiers of items and hopefully more will be added throughout the early access process i couldnt find much of the story during my playthroughs but i dont last long and i think i accidentally skip a lot of the dialogueoverall 7510the game is enjoyable and interesting for the low price of 6 i cant see this ever being a bad purchase theres plenty of content to ingest and the randomly generated worlds keep things interesting"
Tf2,"team fortress 2 aka Tf2 is one of my all time favourites and was the game that brought me into the steam comunity over 5 years ago now bought it before it was free and was definately worth it 3 fantastic game no matter what class or what map your on with all the mods and varrying game modes its never a dull game for me"

Dishonored,"Dishonored is probably one of the most underappreciated games in my library which is why ive chosen to write a quick review on itit has all the aspects of any good game high quality graphics captivating soundtrack indepth story line and smooth gameplay yet i cant help but feel that this game never got the attention it deserves bar a small buzz following the initial release perhaps people felt it was just a mockup of assasins creed because i guess the protagonist mildly resembles desmond milesbut Dishonored has you emotionally invested after the first few minutes of cut scenes the game progresses in saving emily the young princess and overthrowing the corrupt government which doesnt take too long after youve been hooked on the games unique gameplay versatile powers and lootability most people could finish the game in 20 hours if not 15 but beyond the main storyline is a well designed city overflowing with intricate details and side quests not to mention the game allows you to replay different missions to give the game a different outcome even if one runthrough is 15 hours there are hundreds of hours worth of possibilites Dishonored is a beautifully constructed game and i recommend it to gamers from any genre action adventure rpg puzzle etc"
Besiege,"Besiege is a great game however it needs more tools such as copying a group of blocks and pasting allow saving as well like functions in cad softwarenew mode that allows solid connection bewtween block for making huge project without inducing too much lag actually solid like the environment so the group of blocks will be viewed as one large block no bendingsenable multithreading hugeallowing angle block without moddingetc"
Portal,"a great puzzle game that should not be compared with the Portal series there is no similarity between the two besides jump pads thats basically it anyways its a great game that gets you thinking and rushing to survive and reach the goal910"
Portal,"can not say enough good things about this game if you loved Portal youll love this it adds a time travel aspect to the normal game of Portal which makes it awesome i loved Portal and Portal 2 and i love this"
Css,"in the festering world of rpgs or gaming in general in which graphiCsspeedruns that would make sonic say too fast and unneeded fanservice that would make you grit your teeth in rage rather than entertain you take precedence over everything else this is what the gaming world needs but not what it deserves this is my attempt to do a good review and sound not stupidcharacters that are far from stereotypessupposed accusations of marysue that are just actually character devlopment from simply learning from past mistakesgive or take a few tries and a world grounded in real world politics and situations while at the same time a fantastic setting that can keep you entertained and move alongside youit makes realistic situations part of the charm rather than ditching it like most othersafter all there is a good reason why reality is stranger than fiction is a saying if you have the patience to read and immerse yourself in an rpg world that defies the usual cliches that came with the genre than this game is the one for youpsif the wall of text boxes put you off and make you want to skip in a hurry because you want to savewhenever there is dialog stop thinking that you are playing a game but reading a novel you will enjoy it much better"
Terraria,"after never really getting into minecraft or Terraria i never actually thought i would enjoy this game but i took the dive and let the hype train come over me and boy was this the right decision one of the best games ive played this year and it is still in beta now that is saying somethingi havent felt like such a part of a community since the wow vanilla days but this brings back all those feelings againbuy this game in beta you will not regret it"
The_Community,"there is very little not to love about this game the vanilla content is finished to an amazing level of polish the physics are onpoint in almost every car slides are catchable you can feel the tyre wall flex when you approach the limit you can feel the front end push and the back end skate around more than any sim ive ever played the ffb in this game is different to any other game on the market right now for the first few hours the wheel felt dead to me because you only recieve the forces that would be translated to the wheel in the actual car not a bunch of canned effects as well with a t500 the ffb is exact and a pleasure to drive with once you get used to it seriously if you dont own this game and you like sims buy this now and theres a laser scanned nordschleife now whats not to lovebeyond the devs there are truly incredible mods from The_Community i would strongly reccomend the t5 dtm cars from united racing design theyre like the best sim cars ive ever driven and are well worth the price of admission theres millions of other great mods though look on race department and you will find what you desirethere are some areas that are lacking in my opinion for example there are no pit stops or longer races the career system is pretty lackluster the ai still does some weird things and the visual damage modeling is not quite up to scratch yet overall though this game is worth every single cent and then some"

The_Community,"ive being playing this game since the beginning i may not have overclocked hours into like others but ive been here apart of The_Community for a while i have seen the updates and the progress adding new content improving gameplay and twecking features overall ive been happy but this game is dying the one thing that has cut the last straw is that fact that i have to wait 1520 minutes to join a game that doesnt last no longer than 60 seconds and im not over reacting after wasting my time on average a game lasts no longer than 60 seconds cause of this constant long time consumption i have now uninstalled this game as the developers are too worried about releasing new content instead of fixing numerous problems maybe well see in the future if they decide to fix it ill reinstall it again and play again with mates but its not just me its a large majority who have the same problem"

Tf2,"fun game engaging sort of a Tf2 meets brink"
Metro_2033,"loving the storyline of Metro_2033 followed by the insanely realistic gameplay definitely worth buying if you love a good thriller"
The_Community,"the way i see this game is you are either going to love it or you are going to hate it it is in early alpha and it is hard to say whether i think it is worth waiting or picking up nowi personally find the game pretty fun and entertaining but that is just my competitive side talking The_Community is going to be a rough one lot of games with this kill or be killed mentality often have a horrible community starting out lot of people want to kill you because they are curious what you have and want to take it from you it definitely brings the savages out in the world RIRE think if you played dayz minecraft and any other survival type game you may like this game very much but if the kill or be killed mentality is not for you then i would not recommend it they have non pvp servers so it may be an option but majority are pvpi really think the game needs a way to encourage people to work together rather than get greedy and become savage bandits but do so in a way that does not affect the players negatively i often like roleplaying with these kind of games but due to the people out for blood it makes the roleplay very difficult or impossible you are just put in a tough decision to kill as self defence"
Evolve,"i dont understand how dayz can fall right on its face when it comes to majority of the features it lacks and mostly how they can charge 30 for an alpha and this game has everything dayz offers plus a tad more and is completely freeif you want a good survival game and dont want to pay 30 for dayz or even 20 for rust which are both incomplete alpha early access gamesthen this is what you want i have no problem with early access games if they follow a similar route with this this should once again be a clear example and proof that gameplay is more important than graphics this game is not perfect but it is much more fleshed out than the competition here is some positives and negativesyou have skills like crafting shooting survival outdoors stealth that you can increase with expthe map is a good size for nowyou can craft and build houses with different items some recipes are uniquethe game offers a challengeif you want basic roleplay and become a bandit and kill other players then you canyou can make use of your current groups on steam to build a factiondid i mention it is free with optional gold membershipmultiplayer at the moment is pretty limited i recommend Evolve or hamachi as you can not join servers unless you portforward crafting system is good but a bit confusing at times i have not quite figured it out but i do enjoy the lack of handholding zombies ai could use little improvements overall it is good but may be overpowered to some people melee weapon is requiredgraphics some people might find this a negative i honestly do not even though i think because of simple graphics they are capable to deliver the great features but some might complain it looks like kids drawing RIRE doesnt give you alot of gameplay elements you can expect in the game does not discuss most of the featuresaside from those the game has a great start i dont know if this is being developed by only one person but if soyou manage to achieve the basic barebones of what is beginning of a game something i feel lot of these zombie apocalypse survival games are not doing good at they just have basic mechanics"

Team_Fortress_2,"simply they stuffed Team_Fortress_2 over they got rid of dedicated severs in which if you live anyway but usa like me australia your going to have laggy matches because there are bascially no severs in au your going to have to deal with competitive being forced down your throat even in casual bloody casual is now competitiveall i want back is dedicated severs and the old search system back as well"
Tf2,"its living off of the Tf2 items but its a fun game in its own right"
Evolve,"risk of rain is a game deserves to be in your steam librarythis game rEvolves around the items you find which can impact your overall gameplay would you be a ballistic man spewing rockets and mortar nonstop or would you assemble a drone army this depends on your luck the spawn items are random which makes the game have a high replay value having the right items can make you feel like a god as you see boss after boss fall before youthe music itself is very unique and fits the game very well and i commend chris christodoulou for giving the game so much life the artstyle may be a turnoff for people who do not appreciate 8bit graphics however it appeals to me particularly the imp overlord and the monster logs of each creature you can encounter in the game as such a simple art can be so uniquehowever this game like anything has its drawbacks after a certain amount of time collecting the right items combination it is more of a test of patience instead of a test of endurance at a certain point you would feel your items and your drones are carrying you into the battle instead of you some may find the game a little bit brutal particularly during the boss or the late game as they spawn relentlessly but it may appeal to you as it gives you difficulty and challenge99 for this game a steal i must say"

Tf2,"so its only in open beta at the moment but its a real solid game right now sort of what Tf2 would be if Tf2 wasnt such a muck around game its hella fast paced movement speed is really high for all classes and you can wall jump and stuff and mostly balanced there are minor balance issues but the game is constantly being updated and as such the game is generally getting more balanced with each patch the company behind this game seems to quite involved with the community as well and is constantly adding and trialling new content which is nice my only really gripe is its pay model like most free to play fps games you have the option of buying sidegrades with both real and ingame currency each merc class costs a ludicrous amount of ingame currency either 30k or 50k credits where you seldom get 1k per match while i really enjoy grinding for things in game this just seems a tad excessive given there are other things you can spend your credits on it just makes me feel like to get the most out of this game i have to invest actual money into it its just something that irks me but i totally understand why its in the game and its not a particularly terrible thin considering the game is every bit as playable with 2 mercs as it is with 10all in all a great fps that is the right combination of competitive and fun"

Portal,"this game is awesome i highly recommend it it has somewhat of a similar feel to Portal its a firstperson geometrybreaking puzzle game it will mess with your head in a good way and challenge your accustomed ideas about how to play games"
Tf2,"Tf2 is a lot of fun for anyone who enjoys fastpaced skillbased cooperative gameplay the game mechanics encourage players to cooperate and perform the role of the class they are playing as which means that even with strangers online you can get some interesting team tactics but the best games occur when people communicate microphone strongly recommendedthe 9 different classes give a good variety of gameplay from the slow but powerful heavy to the sneaky spy this game has also managed to make medic be a lot of fun mainly due to the ubercharge mechanic where the medic can temporarily make himself and another player invulnerable which can significantly affect the course of playthere is always new content being added maps weapons the allimportant hats as well as special events for occasions such as halloween and Tf2s birthdayalso its free so you really have no excuse not to try it out"

Evolve,"this is overall one of the better western games i have played and has a good upgrading system great physics somewhat destroyable environment and good firefighting but the one thing i didnt like about this game was the guns the guns in this game are excellent to use and high detail but as the game moves foward in time i felt like i was missing out on all the new weaponary of the time like in the year 1910 for example people still used all the old guns in real life but there were tons of new ones peope used as well and i have listed some that should have been there or can maybe be there for the next gameyou should look them upbolt action rifesm1903 springfield from 1900 onwards not realistic but almost all the guns are anachronisticm1892 krag jorgensen rifle from 1890 onwardssemi automatic pistolsmauser c96 from 1895 onwards not realistic but almost all the guns are anachronistic besides the gun 1896 one year latercolt m1900m1902 from 1900 1902 model is almost identicaldouble action rEvolverscolt m1877 from 1877 onwards besides john wesley hardin used this guncolt 1892 38 rEvolveryeah thats it i give this game 8910 if the next game gets these guns and mabye a bit of open worldish feel like the older ones then ill give it 1210"

Dota_2,"this game is so fun with friends learning how to play can be so simply this game is evenly matched to league of legends their pretty much the same concept level up your hero and destroy the main heart of the base expect all heroes are unlocked on Dota_2 but in RIRE you have to pay to buy new heroes and skins something that might make people go crazy but i think Dota_2 should be as much the same popular aspects and i just love it when i get a high kill streak making me feel like a god and winning matches with friend i recommed this game for steam users and enjoy 910"
Undertale,"alright so this is coming from a guy who doesnt necessarily not like but isnt a fan of traditional rpgsif youre doubting buying this game look how much time ive sunk into it its not overly long like other rpgs i got the normal and true endings in a little over 12 hours gameplay and to be quite honest i dont have the heart to do the genocide ending but itll take a lot longer if you explore every nook and cranny the worldnow youre probably thinking gee willikers only 12 hours is this pile of poop really worth tenbuxmy answer is simply hell heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit in yesadmittedly it might take a certain type of person to really enjoy this game and if youre not a fan of rpgs this game probably isnt for you but if youre that type of person wow Undertale is definitely a candidate for goty this game will toy with your emotions throw curveballs at you when you least expect it probably frustrate you with a couple of fights and you will love every single moment of it and also probably cry and definitely laughand even then if youre still doubting buying this video game after reading this and the hundreds and hundreds of other positive reviews like these grab it anyway and if you dont like it get a refund from steam before you hit the 2 hour mark that and theres also a short demo on the official website a very easy way to make sure that 1hr of good lighthearted and feelgood unless you dont want it to be entertainment is right for you"

The_Darkness_2,"the darkness released early february 2012 and was a game that didn ' t receive much advertising or player generated hype The_Darkness_2 follows the story jackie estacado a mob boss who inherits a peculiar ability which is wielding the darkness the game uses cell shading similar to borderlands which compliments the game world well the gameplay is quite original and lets you " quadwield " which basically means you can wield a gun in each hand while also controlling your two darkness demon arms the controls feel a bit fiddly when using a mouse and keyboard if you own a controller i would recommend using that instead this game has some of the most gruesome kills i have ever seen in a game using your demonic arms you can rip your enemies in half slice of their head or even pull out an enemy ' s spine from his butt the list goes on the single player campaign took me about 6 hours on my first play through and left me wanting more not because the game was bad but because it was so darn good there is also a coop campaign which was fun to play with friends but got boring very quickly in summary i really enjoyed this game and its unique gameplay but found it was bit to short"

Terraria,"magicite is an awesome side scrolling game its sort of like Terraria but not so miney and open world like it is an awesome game with a beatiful sound track and is worth the 10 it would be better if the spawns were different and there were a lot more options but right now it is still seriously cool i cant wait for more updates and new features one of which i hope is a bigger inventory"
Nether,"Nether is like dayz in the sense of survival and trust only trust the people you know such as friends or family in Nether you fight to survive an apocolypse in witch demons have taken over what you do is find components and food components for guns and food to survive you dont create guns yourself you get the parts and go find someone who can create them but the guns you can create are fun in of the sample pictures at the top of the page you will see someone holding a can with a handle and a mark saying bullet here this is wierdly enough a shotgun a shotgun made from a fly spray can the things in the game are pretty basic but i hope that they add new things note to the creators add in a crafting section for players to create things i wan na create my own god damn fly spray can shotty"
The_Community,"its one of my favourite all time games and favourite mmo of all time the superhero storyline and theme is very appealing to my personal preference and the combat hack slash system is amazing for an mmo its simply yet can be sophisticated too if you learn all the powers and fighting combos you can put together your online fighting style and combat technique to destroy all opposing forces a lot of people slam the game for all types of reasons but people need to understand no game is perfect and not every aspect of the game will appeal to you this is one of very very few games where 99 of everything in the game appeals to me and makes me want to delve into the game 247 the only downfalls to the game imho is the leveling cap level 30 is very low in my opinion and since i have played since launch i would have hoped that it would have been increased to level 50 at least by now thus adding much more content and storyline to the game the dlcs are ok and some of it was just what i was hoping for but are money grabbing dlcs in other peoples opinions but when you love this game as much as i do i dont mind it at all and will support developers till the end of this games life ive already maxed out and done everything possible in dcuo on the psn network and have recently migrated over to the pc version to start again it shows just how much i love this game and am willing to put in hundreds of dollars again into the game to support developersthe powers in the games could be further externded if possible and more tactical battles amongst pve and pvp would be great too im hoping the game will be expanded over time and more content will be added to bring back veteran players and bring in more new players as well for that to happen the f2p system needs to be looked at again as most people have deemed the game as a p2w game it is somewhat but minimal yet its still enough to throw people off the game and slowly kill The_Community i would love to work aside the soe developers to offer suggestions test new content and help expand the dcuo game overall from day one i have had hopes that it would be expanded and content added on a regular basis to rival games like wow to me it has the potential and should have treaded carefully in doing so but now its too late for that but it still has time to make a 360 degrees turn around and still become one of the best mmos out there the metacritic score of 72100 is very low in my opinion and should have scored much closer to 80 and even 8590 but i believe that the level 30 cap and slow and small amount of content added over the years had hindered its progress and made The_Community much smaller than it should have been if good content and level cap raised happened earlier on the game would would have been much more known and better ranked its direct rival marvel has a much higher metacritic review score and it is a good game but i still believe what dcuo offers is still is just as good if not better i have had ideas in my mind about dcuo and what could be added to the game to make it much better and bring back its player base and even bring in more players i have emailed the soe about it and gotten no reply and believe its fallen on deaf ears andor the team has given up on dcuo or but it on thr back burner because they believe the potential the game had is long gone when it first became f2p it pulled in 100k new accounts soe should have used that opportunity to build upon the amazing the game they already had and add content accordingly so the new players could see how amazing dcuo really is and what theyve been missing out on but sadly i believe it was all done as a ploy to grab as much money as they can to base future dlc projects upon the amount of players and funds coming into their account thats where i think soe went most wrong instead of listening to the player base and adpting to the f2p system they implemented they went on how much money they could make and didnt take the communities opinions and suggestions seriously or at all in most cases to finish up on my review for now i still think dcuo is an amazing game and definitely recommend to everyone that loves mmos hack slash type of games rpgs dc universe and a mostly friendly community base the game has some flaws and drawbacks but no game is perfect but imho this game comes closest to being a perfect game in my eyes the majority of its content is very appealing to my personal preferences and keeps me very intrigued and wanting to constantly play every free moment i get i have a ton of suggestions ideas and concepts that couldwould make the game amazing and hugely expansive without much work necessary but whether someone from soe reaches out or even cares enough about its own game to do so i will only have to wait and see i have contacted them twice already in recent times with no reply or acknowledgment at all that they have received my email so i assuming their response team is either lacking in personnel or just cant be bothered i hope dcuo will continue to expand and soe looks to add an expansion pack as rumors were swirling when dcuo was at its peak but since then there has been nothing but mediocre dlc packs good or poor as they may be we need more i would love for an expansion that would raise level cap and introduce a new main storyline to dcuo it would be amazing to see and i could gurantee it will bring back alot of veterans and even bring in new players to the game as they see the development team are still working on the game and actively adding more and better content as it is right now the latest content added are very small and lazylike not much hype or even amazment about them seems like a small team is only left to deal with dcuo and it is very saddening in my eyes and heart i had wished and still do for dcuo to be around for at least another 5 years with active excellent content being added all the possible storylines are already there in the dc comics and just needs to be integrated into dcuo i dont see how hard that can be and how much amazment it would bring to true dc fans and dcuo fans ill give soe a free ideasuggestion on a possible future expansion to further dcuo and its content and gameplay take the dcuo universe to the universeliterallybrainiac came to uslets now take the battle to him and his home giving the opportuinty to even explore the green lanterns galaxy the remains of the planet kryptonthere is so much more that can be added and expanded from that alone enough to create an expansion that would be mind blowing and amaze the die dc fans and dcuo fans if this were somehow to materialize i would further support dcuo and soe and make sure to do my part in helping spreading the word about the expansion and if given the opportuniy even help out with testing suggestions or anything i can be of help with if soe were to approach and ask me to help i would be a great ambassador for dcuo my love for the game knows no bounds and i just wish for its success to be limitless and never ending please soe heed my word and suggestions and do whats best for us dcuo fans i will forever be grateful and dont want to see dcuo end up a dead community where i am running around with a few people trying the game and leaving not long after because of the dead player base its already saddening to see the same players over and over and no new people or veterans but im sure an expansion and marketing and awarness project would bring dcuo back to life again to the peaks of mmo history and amazement that its destined to be it should be rivaling wow wow has no real rival and i thought dcuo had that potential with its already rich history of lore and stories that are already out there how amazing would it be to play it with your own created hero 9710 almost perfect"
Terraria,"a great game similar to Terraria but more advanced and refined"
Terraria,"this game is like no other well its like minecraft but you get the point there are a lot of different things about Terraria though you can 1 craft more things than minecraft2you can eat mushrooms3 npcs can move into your home4 you can customize your characterthese are only some of the things you can do in Terraria rather than in minecraftso putting this all in a nutshellbuy Terraria"
Super_Meat_Boy,"what a fantastic game thats all there is to it rogue legacy is a great way of easing players into the difficult retrosidescrollerish genre that has been popping up a lot in the indie scene sure youll die a lot but you learn more on each death unlock other difficult games of recent years Super_Meat_Boy dark souls etc this game forces you to adapt rather than memorise your strategies levels will change repeatedly enemy layouts will change the way they scale will change you have to roll with the punches heh thanks ynab it took me 15hrs to see it through on my first playthrough and what a fun and challenging 15 hours it was so much praise cellar door games and what theyve done here"

Evolve,"i recently started and finished the vanishing of ethan carter in a single sitting and was thoroughly impressed the entire 42 hours it took me to fully complete the gamealthough very short and possibly too short for the full price of the game tvoec offers a simplistic yet incredibly engaging game taking inspiration from early 20th century weird fiction namely hp lovecraft as expected the story rEvolves around a private eye on a mission in an isolated village to help one ethan carter while playing through the opening segment it seemed quite similar to dark corners of the earth also available on steam but broken as all hell being dumped in a disturbing setting with next to no guidance only to figure everything out for yourself this minimalist style of gameplay definitely works in the games favour as it seems to allow for a more immersive experience there is no hud health bars maps or quest icons you have the wasd keys the mouse and your own two feetgameplay rEvolves around solving various puzzles and entering the minds of those deceased to see memories shortly before their deaths it feels slightly cliche but isnt too overthetop like you might expect the games story is unravelled through these various puzzle sequences as you explore the village in which the game is set learning of the characters and their relationships with one another its definitely not an indepth story but it is very engagingwhere tvoec really shines is in its atmosphere from the very first minute of the game the atmosphere of this game almost smacks you in the face with how incredibly immersive it is the stunning environments beautifullycomposed soundtrack and occasional narration from the main character provide an incredible feeling of isolation as you make your way through an empty and rundown village its almost unlike any game ive ever played and has to be played to fully understandi picked the game up off the humble store for 66 coincidence and felt very satisfied with my purchase for the rrp of 199 it may seem like a bit much for a game that can be finished in a few hours but for anything 10 or less its definitely a musthave for fans of mystery horror and weird fiction"
Portal,"this game is a great thirdperson button masherbeatemup that includes many different cleaver and satisfying puzzles to advance to different stages these puzzles include the use of jumpinggliding explosives grappling hooks slowing time and Portals the first part of the game you will be also doing a few cool arenas with different objectives such as aerial kills and protecting zombiesbosses are really fun and have really cool mechanics if you liked raiding it wow i would defiantly recommend thisthere are only a few bad things i can say about this game i found some with lots of crashing and buggy achievementshand ins you may also require a controller as it is a port"
Loadout,"i highly recommend this realistic style fps to anyone interested in tactical and strategic gameplay having no unlocks whatsoever is a great advantage leveling the playing field for everyone and having the ability to customise your Loadout to your own play style i have only owned this game for around two weeks and am hooked"
Portal,"this game is very enjoyable for a little sitdown in the afternoon the puzzles are fun and some are a little hard but when you get them you feel good and that is a great feeling it has some bugs and issues the music in this game is amazing 1010 i saw alot of people hating on the voice actor and i feel bad for him because i actually enjoyed his voice alot the plot twist is amazing and the fast pased intence monents are fun expecially the one where you only have 60 seconds to escape i loved that all in all i really like the game and i admit its not living up to Portal2 but this game is still fun but would be better if you didnt have to purchase it kinda heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit 710"

Tf2,"this game is terrible i do not recommend it in the slightestfor a game called pay day i didnt get a regular payment from the government you see i rely on my benefit in order to purchase games on steam and if i am not getting money no games this game expected me to think in order to succeed do i look like a rocket scientist heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit this heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit right here in particular if i wanted to play a game that involves thinking i would just go back to Tf2 and calculate the trajectory of rocket jumping im also highly afraid of clowns so every moment i joined a game i screeched in terror as a team mate came into my vicinity 110"
The_Community,"before review notice played about 100200 hours on the browser before the steam release and am only just now getting round to this review because i havent quite been bothered enoughbegin review p positive this game is great if only i could end it like that but there is so much more to say the game itself is like if insurgency and battlefield had a child which decided to become free no mum this is my art to begin with The_Community is great at least in australiaoceania ive only encounted a few toxic squeakers and have made it my person mission to eliminate them repeatedlythe guns are really fluid and i like the semirealistic take the developers have taken on with most rifles and smgs requiring 23 bullets to killthe maps are fun to play and encourage teamwork and make for some great moments with or without friends new guns every month or so negative optional buyin credits of some sort really quite optional as mentioned before pretty much every gun does 23 bullet kills snipers obviously lessometimes struggle to actually get into the game keeps saying installing plugin please wait for about 10 minutes but as mentioned before once you get into the game you can easily forgive itwell thats pretty much it hope this helped you make a decision in the end though its free its fun and a good time waster 57 would spend 20 minutes writing a review for again"
Dota_2,"this is going to be a mixed review however i will recommend it for experienced or veteran moba players if you are starting out in the moba scene this is not really the game for you sorry its simply just not polished enough for people beginning in the world of mobasi dont have a whole lot of experience with this game so far but i have clocked literal hundreds of hours on RIRE and Dota_2 so i do have moba experience positives personal courier system a really interesting idea that i think works well and helps focus the combat on killing heroes and creepsminionsbrawlers from now on will be referred to as brawlers and not on looking out for couriers to earn some extra gold recipe system a really cool idea that allows you to change the components that makeup a recipe thus giving you different stats but still what the weapon is supposed to do pets another interesting idea that provides a little bonus for your hero and arent too overpowered or take away from the obverall experience lasthit system playing and looking at the demovideos of strife it is obvious that they have purposely designed this moba to minimise toxicity between players not only through community like RIRE but also through core game components and mechanics i feel that this works really well and benefits everyone constant stream of heroes this is both a positive and a negative which will be brought up later not much to be said the more the merrier right waiting for loaders when waiting for other loaders you are placed in the game your herochampion can not move but they can level their chosen skill and purchase items from the shop i like this as it makes waiting for others a little less boringnegatives towers i think every review has covered this towers are horrendously overpowered seriously in league or dota its possible to tower dive for about half a minute or so to secure an enemy kill but in strife the moment you attack and enemy hero under their tower you are targeted this is ok but the towers hit like a truck for the whole game fully levelled people are still scared of those damn things this needs to be fixed asap constant stream of heroes unfortunately the constant stream of heroes is also a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth with a large amount of new heroes the ones already in the game can not be refined fast enough and there are some glaringly obvious heroeschampions with op abilities and such penalty for leaving you cant play another game until the one you left is over yup thats itthere are probably a whole bunch of things that ive missed about this game but on the whole i enjoy it as a refreshing take on the moba scenemisc things no au servers this obviously only affects au players but a constant ping of 200300 is kinda annoying no all chat i just cant find it maybe it doesnt exist probably due to the antitoxic community take the team are going foroverall to conclude i would say that this game is what it is early access beta its a pretty cool and new take on moba but its still early access and needs some or a lot of work if you enjoy mobas and know your way around them give this one a shot i think youll like it for what it is if you are new to mobas and are looking for one to start off with give this one a miss until you have more experience simply because i think youll have a better experience with other mobasnow this is all my exerience with the game with a measly 10 hours under my belt thanks for reading guysglitch"
Super_Meat_Boy,"though simple the art style and animations are absolutely beautiful having this helps when youre staring at the same thing for how many hours due to dying so much the soundtrack compliments the game as well and though freaking difficult you still wan na play more and morethe controls are simple and not complicated whatsoever with very few buttons youre able to do a range of diferent attacks though i have to admit on multiple occassions i had attempted to say just do a quick punch though what happened was a quick dash ultimately leading to my death whether it be into a pile of spikes or off the ledge it just adds to the difficulty of the game though usually is no problemthere a different factors of this game that remind me of Super_Meat_Boy and both games are great got heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit at both but nevertheless theyre still really fun id recommend this to anyone up for a challenge youre going to die whilst playing this game a lot but no matter how many times you may or how angry you get its all worth it if youre a sucker for platformers definitely pick this up have fun dying"
Tf2,"this game is so much fun with a stupid out look similar to Tf2 runing around in budgie smugglers and your left nut hanging out RIRE running around naked and twerking holy crap if you are intrested before downloading see if you like it watch some game play at httpwwyoutubecomwatchv4wfn49m1k7g"

Terraria,"really good game great game if you are a fan of games like minecraft and Terraria"
Portal,"fantastic game wonderfully designed to match the features of Portal 2 but makes it extremely more difficult while the story is definitely set out well and virgil the new core is a joyful addition to the game this can often be undercut by the difficulty of the game as it will often take vigorous methodical work to even get close to an answer for a course that is something you wouldnt even consider as it goes against the puzzle solving mechanics of the original two gameshowever the voiceacting interactions with virgil and the very pleasant old timey feel of the game helps to push you through it and at a total of zero dollars makes for an enjoyable journey through the old Portal universe that youve been missing for four years i would definitely recommend it for those whove been waiting for Portal 3 as it may be the closest well ever get but maybe not for those with short patience as it is definitely a game of hard thinkingthe ending is superb it has a beautiful soundtrack virgil is a splendid character to take you on the adventure and in the end the game just feels like a new Portal game it is fantastically well done and fantastically difficult"
Dota_2,"deep and complex fun and rewarding despicable and anger indusing these are the things that Dota_2 is and frankly it wouldnt be better any other way"
Tf2,"great shooter amazing character customization even more so for the guns most character and avatar customization requires premium currency but character items can be found in daily rewards its got a some great crude humor and beautiful graphics this game is great for any Tf2 veteran or shooter player in general"
Besiege,"its come to the point where people see the red flag of early access and decide to skip conditioned to do so by a large variety of games that show promise but are eventually abandoned by the developers to rot in a pool of graphical glitches and unfinished stories being one of those people my initial reaction was to pirate this game expecting something brief not worth my time instead i found a thoroughly enjoyable experience that led me to actually buy the game and play through the levels i had so far completed againill just say it now i think its worth buying Besiege for what it currently has to offer a 7 price tag is insanely cheap for a game that i would expect to cost 15 or 20 while currently there are limited levels available there really is an infite amount of time one can spend on them if you simply rush through the game completing each level as fast as possible youll likely be done in under 2 hours dependant upon your proficiencyhowever youd be doing the game and yourself a great injustice this game is not just about completing simple tasks its about completing them in the most wacky and roundabout ways you can imagine youll find yourself restarting levels to try new ideas perhaps to beat your time or minimum amount of blocks used or perhaps just to see if itll worknow that ive praised the game heres what i dont like about it keeping in mind these will probably all be solved in future updates1 lack of tutorialswhile the game is relatively simple there are no real tutorials to teach you what to do if youre clever enough youll be able to figure out how to do basic functions by yourself steering flying etc and the game is all about building testing failing building again however some basic tutorials to point players in the right direction could solve a lot of ragequits2 no multiplayercome on developers this is the obvious thing to do with the game you add a multiplayer battle arena where you let people fight to the death with their machines perhaps limiting their number of blocks or which blocks can be used maybe you could even add other multiplayer gamemodes like races or castle sieges to me this seems like the obvious direction to take the game in because itll be awesome and will encourage people to buy rather than pirate3 the controlsthe controls for moving around the camera seem straightforward yet somehow i always have trouble adjusting to them im not sure why everything works the way it should but i always end up being far too zoomed out when trying to look at something from underneath4 the lagthis is likely an inherent issue with the engine and not something easily fixable but i thought it would be worth mentioning ive got a pretty high end gaming pc but on levels with a lot of enemies and a very large machine i do find the game to lag momentarily when i test my machine keep in mind ive only encountered this in specific scenarios and only for a few seconds before it settlesas you can see these issues are all relatively minor and will likely be fixed in the future even if they werent id still recommend this game buy it"

The_Community,"ive been playing unturned for a short period of time but i have to say that it is looking very promising as ive only played the free version of the game im yet to see the features that are available when playing the premium version when you first open the game youre given the opportunity to create a character there are a variety of customisation options available however some of which are only unlocked with the premium version of the game once passed the character customisation stage which can be edited later anyway you can choose between a singleplayer multiplayer and tutorial option being a man that likes to learn for himself i reframed from playing the tutorial but for the sake of reviewing unturned i did the tutorial gives you a basic rundown of the controls movement combat and driving simple but helpful then i decided to jump straight onto singleplayer unturned gives you two options of maps to play on pei which is your basic postapocalyptic map with buildings and towns and arena a difficult map which places you in an arena like area with nothing but the forest around you i decided to play on the pei map first once spawned i realised that you start off with nothing and i literally mean nothing you dont even spawn with clothes on the spawning in unturned is random so i was spawned near a walled off area which i later found was a military base i fought my way through the base and gathered a few supplies including a backpack handgun and suppresor and a map of the whole of pei while in this menu i discovered a skills menu which can be upgraded by earning eperience though killing zombies and a crafting menu which didnt make sense to me so i decided to leave it be judging from the map it seemed that pei was a large scale map that had many places to visit so i decided to visit the local town once i arrived i was greeted by a large horde of zombies i managed to pick off 5 of them with my handgun but i ran out of ammo and had to run for about 5 minutes before running upstairs into a house and dying because i got stuck in the tub this is the point where i decided i was bad at video games and also decided to play on the other ma arena once loaded it spawned me into an arena like area the areanwas surrounded by water ans there were tall rocks around me vaguely resembling stone henge and some supplies however due to the small inventory space i could only carry a small knife and three seed which i planted soon after i decided to venture out into the woods and i quickly got lost my hunger and thirst bars needed tending to so i decided to hunt some animals and quickly realised that the pigs i was chasing were very fast or that my player spent too much time writing a pointless review of a game that nobody will ever read so he gained a substancial amount of weight and decided not to go outside anymore i soon realised that the only way to satisfy these meters was to travel back to the spawn and harvest the seeds i planted earlier but i unsucessfully did so and died trying to find which way i came from then i decided to try out the multiplayer secion of the game but was unable to do so because i have no friends unturned is a great game however i do feel that playing with friends would give you a much different and better experience in contrast to playing by yourself unturned feels like a very basic version of dayz or games similar to this and this is not a bad thing unturned gives you a similar experience to these games but it expresses itself in a much different way this is mainly bue to the blocky artstyle of the game which much resembles games like roblox and minecraft unturned is the type of game that you could let your 7 year old brother play without getting into trouble by your mum for letting him play a violent video game but can still be played by the older demographic just the same to summarise this review i reccomed this game to anyone however get some friends whip up a server and play together and youll have a much better experience do i see potential in this game yes i do so long as the developers continue to work hard and listen to The_Community and take their ideas on boards as well as their own give unturned a try you wont be let down"

Terraria,"this is more of a first impressions review i have not gotten very far and may or may not edit this review latersaying pixal piracy is Terraria but with pirates is nowhere near giving this enough credit this game clearly has complexity far beyond Terrariano a better way to describe it is an adventure micromanageitup with the many abilities crew weapons and ship parts this has potential stuck up the wahfreakinzoo not to mention that daunting hunger system that some players may find a tad too hard and the cleaning and repairing and the fishing and theok ill stopbasically this is a complex game from what ive seen so far if you arent ready to micromanage the hell out of stuff you may find yourself being confused and getting yourself into an infinite loop of starving to death like meoverall pixal piracy has a lot of potential and if youre fine with buying games that are still in development and are all good with micromanaging i highly recommend this as it is a super fun game"

Evolve,"big alpha review i came into playing the big alpha for Evolve with low expectations i have never played a game thats in alpha before and expected a broken barely playabale piece of trash but i can pleasantly say that the alpha is surprisingly well polished the good stuff the gameplay is exciting i often find myself on my toes always alert for the monster has startled the birds icon i couldnt wait to spring into action with my team mates playing as the monster is just as exciting always on the prowl sniffing out your enemies as you devour the wildlife and become so powerful the hunters become the preythe classes the game provides assault trapper medic and support everyone has their own job and if one falls the hunters may find it difficult to survive the class system makes it important for teamwork to exist within the game making it a very good game to play with friendseven on low graphics had to turn it down due to optimization issues more on that later the game looks great enviroments are lush and the dark gloomy time setting makes the games atnosphere that much better the bad stuff ive read other reviews and forums and it seems that alot of people are having issues with the game even with powerful systems admitedly my system isnt top tier but its no scrap yard and i was having issues running the game on high to get a smooth enjoyable experience i had to turn the graphics down to low however i didnt expect much less it is in alpha after allthe loading times took along time i mean 1015 minutes long just to get into a bloody level i kept having audio issues gun sounds repeatedly going off when i wasnt firing etc quite irritating the conclusion its good its very goodfor an alpha you need to keep that in mind when playing something that isnt a full release the devs have already said they are continuing to add on to this game and have a very clean polished game out in febuaryi highly recomend this unfortunately i am writing this on the last day i will ofcourse try to get a couple more hours in so lets hope the full game is as pleasant as this"
Csgo,"counterstrike global offensive truly differs from the other modern aa shooters that are released prosCsgo has a variety of game modes that appeal to the general fan base of first person shooters such as deathmatch and arms race but keeps its core focus on the classic 5v5 diffuse mission that every counterstrike fan knows and lovesthe game encourages team tactics and cooperation between team mates which can be difficult due to the occasional prat who decides to wedge the bomb inbetween the car next to t spawn and a wall but when you dont have a team mate with the iq of a drooling two year old you can effectively develop stratergies that work with your team whether its full of strangers or some of your closest friends friendships are madethe mechanics of the game push a new player through a steep learning curve with difficult recoil control or making sure they stay fairly quiet both of these things can ruin first impressions but can easily be learnt and adapted to over timethere is a wide variety of maps with ocasional dlc coming out every season containing new maps and weapon skin casesconsthe valve anticheat doesnt seem to be working that well gabe now this may just be a personal issue seeing as the servers you autoconnect to depend on your region the oceanic reigon for yours truly but i constantly run in to people with obvious aimcheats wallcheats etc etc which really ruins the gamei got a ban for kicking too many people in previous gamesexcuse me i consider myself to be a pretty fair guy and i understand that not everyone can 4k clutch so i only vote to kick someone if theyre doing worse than a bot would or being a giant heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit in these cases these players were being tremendous knobs killing team mates throwing the bomb into unreachable places playing rap music down their microphone etc therefore i the teams i was playing on came to a mutual agreement to kick the players i just think the reason for the ban is a load of cackaah yes skin cases now im not really considering this a con as its not valves fault for making me spend that much money tt only open casescrates if you have the money you will regret itdespite the couple of negative things i had to say i give counterstrike a whole heartedly 910 if a game can make me as angry as this one can it means it deserves a pretty solid rating i recomend this game to any one thinking of getting it but with a warning this game is harder to learn than your average shooter dont go in with the mindset that youre going to wreck people in your first day you wont and thats good its just the beggining soldier"
Terraria,"Terraria is a great game its better than minecraft in some ways like more weapons armor blocks etc its also great to play with friends and its a cheap game to play unlike some other bulding games i give Terraria a 80100"
Evolve,"are you one of those people who dont want to read a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ton of text describing the mechanics of the game then ill keep it simpledex is great game that is hard to recommend despite it being so goodit has so many issues as well as some baffling basic design oversights that it would easily turn off so many people from the very starthowever if you dig through the dirt mud and other various amounts of filth youll find something that truly shines with a lot of potential especially in comparison to whats currently on steam as of latethe melee combat and shooting all packs a punch and is very enjoyable the rpg mechanics are varied robust and are tailored to how you want to play as well as the story and world the devs created being extremely interesting and a unique take on the genrething is youll have to dig a through a lot of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit to fully enjoy it dex is a bit like alpha protocol in that regard lot of potential but is so bugged up the fudge hole that a person suffering from crabs would cringe it all depends on how much you can suffer throughfor those wanting a proper review theres more after the breakalright time to go balls deep into dexif i had to describe what dex is to someone id say thisdex is a thirdperson side scrolling rpg that has a large emphasis on a unique hacking premise with some shooting and brawling and even some basic stealth mixed in for good measure the game is set in a original cyberpunk world where augmentations are all the rage and hacking is a good way to rack up some cash this is all drawn and animated in astounding detail which creates a very interesting aestheticits a little like if the original deus ex got drunk one night and knocked up shantae the pirates curse nine months later this red headed freckle faced mix of both games pops out as an indie game available on steam for twenty bucksthat deus ex comparison isnt unwarranted either dex is a full blown rpg with action elements instead of an action rpg like deus ex human revolution you suck at everything until you level that skill up or get a specific augmentation to enhance itfor example do you want to carry shotguns and smgs into battle and fire them with pinpoint accuracybetter save up your skill points thenwant to be able to lock pick almost every single locked door in the game not problemgrind your exp and then level the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit upwant to be able to coerce pimps into lending you their fanciest male hookers for a kinky bangtime at a discountlevel up your charisma pick the right choice during dialogue and have fun you perverted freakspeaking of which yes theres a dialogue system in dex even if you have maxed out charisma you need to pick the way way of coercing someone at the time some people respond to threats others respond to bribes and others respond to flattery pick the wrong one and youd best reload a save and try again buddy it works well and always keeps conversations tense as you need to always pay attention to what they say the writing itself is very well done and descriptive kinda reminds me of the old crpgs of yesteryear the dialogue is also voice acted and heres where dex starts to fall apartthe voice actors arent bad at all and always suit the character and role their playing but the actual voice direction itself leaves something to be desired it always seems like they took only one take for each line and it can sound extremely amateurish and awkward at times you can turn voices off in the option screen of the main menu if you wish but then during cutscenes theyll be completely silent except for the bombastic and rather nice i might add score blasting over stock still imageswhile were on the bad side of this ill also add that some sound effects in general just seem to be completely heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing missing or nonexistent for example during the game you can sneak up on some unaware thugs and choke them to death giving the same amount of exp for little to no effort as well as avoiding any possible injuries but they make no sound the chick you play as just dry humps them for a moment and they fall dead again with absolutely no noise to accompany it not even when the body falls downif i sneak up on someone and snap their bloody neck in a video game i expect to hear a sickening crack to go along with the action its just plain unnerving when it doesntanother thing wrong is the control scheme for both the controller and the keyboard and mouse some keys are just in a weird unnatural spot q to dodge during melee who was the pants on head heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit who chose that brilliant key placementand i have never played a game that had these few actual commands to input that has forced me to use the keyalso the jumping has some weird form of gravity that drops if you dont hold in spacebar until you fully finish the jump if you let go too earlier be prepared to drop like a sack of bricksthe devs have patched the game so that you can rebind keys so props to them but this should have been thought out more clearly from the startthere are also a few visual glitches here and there and some that really hinder the gameplay like the journal getting confused and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing up i guess it sounds like i really hate the game but its the opposite there is a brilliant game here buried underneath some confusing design choiceswhile stealth is aggravatingly basic walk behind someone and press a button to instakill the actual melee combat is simple but satisfying and deep with a basic one two punch combo dodging blocking and special moves unlocked the more points you put into the fighting skillplus if you dont feel like getting your hands dirty you can always pull out a great big heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing magnum rEvolver and empty it into someones cranium as fast as you can pull the trigger skill points in the guns skill also unlock more weapons that you able to use as well as reducing accuracy recoil and stuff like thatlike previously mentioned there are other skills you can upgrade such asendurancehackinglockpickingcharismaand a few morehacking plays a key role in the story of dex and as such has its own minigame dedicated to it without going into it too much its fun encourages thoroughness and skill and never gets tedious or unwelcomethere is also an abundance of sidequests and the most that i have encountered are well done with good writing always worth the effort for the cash or other bonuses reward as well as having some various options of how exactly to complete themi wont go into the story as i generally believe that the story in a game can fall apart if you know too much beforehand believe me when i say it is worth your timeall in all dex is worth the time of any patient rpg fan especially those with a massive throbbing hardon for cyberpunk such as myself and especially those who are looking for something akin to the original deus ex even with all the problems i mentionedis it perfect no mia khalifa isnt perfect either but you can bet that if she was willing id jump her bones like a starving houndworth every penny"
Half_Life_2,"i originally had massive problems with running this game and plenty of others did as well in my frustration i wrote a negative review because of its near unplayable stateinterdimensional studios themselves admited and apologized that consortiums launch was horribly buggy and thankfully this is no longer the case with all their hard work and dedication to the project all bugs gamebreaking or just weird are now gone i intended on fully editing this review if the problems were solved and now they havei can best describe consortium as a mix of the original star trek and mass effect with the shooting mechanics and engine of Half_Life_2 and if that mix doesnt sound good to you or you didnt like any of these examples then its hard to recommend however if youre looking for epic 1st person scifi romp with an emphasis on story dialogue player choice story and wrapped up with some decent shooting mechanics look no furtherconsortium is also the first in a trilogy and only lasts about 10 hours at the most however it never feels too short and im very excited for whats to come the story is brilliantly written the game has marvelous presentation and the characters throughout the adventure are interesting and their dialogue throughout it is well done combat is a bit like an old school shooter mixed with halflife 2 which i find works well enough but its hardly the focus of the gameno the focus of consortium is the interactions between you and the other crew aboard the ship with multiple dialogue choices and the dire consequences for most of them and interdermentional studios have done it brilliantly even with my previous frustration at launch its obvious how far consortium has come and the master edition truly is worth anyones time especially for only 20 this is the type of game ive been wanting ever since mass effect came out and it certainly doesnt disappoint"

Metro_2033,"based on the book by dmitry glukhovsky and i have to say the games is a beaststory is pretty good and very interesting following the concept of you destroying the so called dark ones being a post nuclear disaster game you will be killing lots of mutants and encounter communist enemys and even fight the 4th reich the problems with the game are sadly bad pc optimizing and a somewhat weird and not so clear ending that makes you ask alot of questions about what just happened overall i would say Metro_2033 is a really good game if you ignore the optimizing and other little problems and i say it is a game worth buying it is only 99EUR also the sequel for this game called metro last light is coming out this year on may 17 for people living in europe and i cant wait for it"

Terraria,"some think that Terraria is the 2d version of minecraftin a way that may be true but the game has a lot more to it than just being 2d there is a lot more adventure in Terraria although the map is limited with the different mobs scattered throughout the biomes it wil be a lot more challengingbossesthere are many bosses that you can fight as you become better at playing the bosses also get harder to make it a continuous challengeitemsitemsthat one of the greatest things about this game there are so many items you can make so many things so many weapons with different attributes and you can choose which ones you want to fight with depending on your preference of combatblocksif youre a builder theres a variety of blocks and the blacks can also change their shape too you can beuild a lot of things anything you want tooverall i believe that Terraria is a cool game to play the gaming hours can total over few hundred hours consider checking it outthankschamon lee"

Portal,"as a fan of dc comics this game presents its characters really well espiacially the joker the combat is really freeflow smooth and satisfying in every hit the story would not impact you the same way games like Portal or hlseries do but it does leave memorable moments it could really be summarized to punch save someone punch win di wished there was a arena mode or something that can let me punch people indefinitely but the closest you get is the ranked challenges irecommended gameplay is smooth polished and well donerecommended 910"

Portal,"killing floor is one of the best coop games on steam there i said it it even rivals Portal 2 and day z in my mind for 199 it might be a bit overpriced but lower the price to 1499 or 99 and youve got yourself a great deal 6 player coop in a wave based system was a great idea that sounds a little like call of duty zombies but i assure you this is a completly different expirence most maps are around 9 waves long with a 10th boss wave to finish the game through out the game you can buy guns melee wepons grenades and body armor but on the higher difficulty levels it seems you never have enough cash to buy what you want which means going without that badass shotgun or that samurai sword for yet another roundfinal words if you have some steam friends get the boys or girls together for some great zombie killing"

Portal,"Portal 2 is the second and latest installment in the Portal series in the Portal series you solve puzzles with Portals i would like to start off by stating that i absolutely love this game in every way imaginable if you dont want to read the rest of this review then all i can say is just purchase it because this a game that i would love to forget about and start over withstorylinethe storyline in this is just amazing and is one of the things that keeps you going and playing through this game no matter how hard the puzzles are and just when you think you have had enough it just hooks you back in again for moregameplaythe majority of Portal 2s gameplay consists of puzzle solving right from the start at the start puzzle solving is relatively easy and quite simple but once you start getting into it it slowly gets more difficult as you progress through the test chambers and they always keep it interesting when adding new elements to the tests every now and again one thing is for sure though you will find yourself getting stuck and maybe even a bit frustrated but a small break to regather your thoughts is all it takes to figre out a puzzleatmostphereone thing that this game is best at is making you feel lonely the emptiness of the ambience and soundtrack is really all it takes to make you feel alone and this is probably one of the best features it has the soundtracks that were picked for this game are just incredible at creating an amazing atmostpherecoopcoop is just a load of fun with your friends it really is just fun to mess around with them block their Portals and just do whatever the hell you want thats not saying that you cant be serious as welloveralli really do think that valve thought this game out well and created an amazing experience especially with all this content included it really is such a bargain to grab off a steam sale110 amazing"

Dota_2,"it is quite a difficult game to initially grasp the storeshop and the secret storeshops are really quite aan interesting touch that until you get used to the game are quite annoying the concept of donkeys bringing you gear is really nice it enables you to stay in lane longer then most other mobas which is good i didnt particularly enjoy having to buy town scrolls to teleport to my base id rather press b wait and bam home but i guess it makes Dota_2 stand out my cs game is particularly good in pretty much every moba from league of legends to smite to awesomenauts to super monday night combat and in these games if you dont cs all to well or even dont get kills as long as you dont die its possible to stay in the game whereas dota gold collecting automatically takes a some time and csinglast hitting minions is quite hard but gets you around 50 gold which is really a pain as if you dont cs or get kills you fall behind everyone else most shop items are rather expensive and that is purely based on the knowledge i have from other mobas i would consder myself a pretty good moba player but i dont know what it is about Dota_2 that i find myself not doing as much damage as the other guy as a character that looks like a carryranged carry it takes some time to get used to and it takes some time a long time to understand each characters ability set and know how to play around itid give this game 710 would recommend"
The_Community,"at the time of writing this review i just finished the game about 30 minutes ago now when i finished it i felt amazing and this game makes you feel amazing both with its story which i wont spoil and gameplay but i finished it in 14 hours which i didnt have that much a problem with exept for the fact that i finished dustan elysian tale the day before in also 14 hours and that was made by 1 person which got me thinking thinking about why theres such a similarity between game completion rate and such a big difference between development however this greatly redeemed itself when at the end of the credits it said that i completed 2 of its entirety now the gameplay is very good from perfect platforming alliteration to a well made thirdperson shooter this game trully makes you feel like a badass and at times a genius when you finish a puzzle from a tomb the only problem i had with the gameplay was the qtes quick time events which got repetitive at times and made me die too many times another problem i had was The_Community for the multiplayer the problem it didnt exist noone plays multiplayer so i cant really talk about it much to conclude tomb raider is an amazing single player game with the problem of annoying qtes and a nonexistant multiplayer community i recommend it for the single player not the multiplayer"
Team_Fortress_2,"y es lo mejor para hacer videos de Team_Fortress_2 etc lo recomiendo mucho"
Tf2,"i love the fps mock that is Tf2 it is hours of fun but it takes forever fo me to update"
Evolve,"visually stunning and interesting of course but that can only carry a game so far exploring becomes tedious and dull after a while as the puzzles dont really Evolve much beyond the flipping perspective mechanic and the areas are connected in a confusing mazelike fashion that just left me feeling unsure of where to go and not really motivated to bother methodically searching around maybe this just isnt my sort of game but i cant recommend it"
Portal,"short but oh so sweet Portal is an all time classic that i probably dont even need to bother reviewing at all really immensely satisfying to play look at listen to and be insulted by highly recommend"
Tf2,"ok so firstly if you are here for Tf2 items then do not buy this game the money isnt worth the Tf2 items and when you buy the game it takes forever to get the items secondly if you are looking for fun look somewhere else this game has low graphics and boring characters poker can be played on the internet for freewhen you are aiming to get Tf2 items in this game you need to play poker for hours and hours and you must win in order to obtain the items in this game you must play poker and beat the other 4 players in order to win there are 5 players in total yourself max strong bad the heavy and tycho in order to win items you must keep playing games until you encounter someone coughing up some gear but you need to defeat that player and if anyone else defeats the player you lose the item the items take forever to encounter and you have a low chance of winning the item it take several hours or maybe even days to obtain them all i have encountered items before but never received themthis game is not recommended unless you have fine skills at poker and you are desperate for these items it is an absolute waste of money if you are trying to get the items 410chop2014"
The_Community,"this game had so much potential on the day it was created with alot of fanbased projects it really got The_Community going when it was first released and this game had a lot of potential trove is basically world of warcraft and minecraft the concept of mmorpg grinding is still there and there is the block building breaking and making idea implemented in the game as well trove started to become a game loved by The_Community and trion decided to add in more pay to win options in every single update this is very true and trion will probably never change it after you zoom in to about 50 hours of the game a few hundred dollars can change you from early game to late game their ingame purchase benefits are crazy and a few dollars spent makes up for a few days of grinding major in game benefits and boosts such as patron which is like membership costs irl money and increases bonus stats by a crazy amount however trove has tried to conceal the fact that they are money hungry beasts and added in a feature where each day has a different bonuses so free to play players can grind this bonus doubled and increased if you have patron making patron an extremely game changing thing however although pay to win is a major problem free to play players can still thrive if you have hundreds of hours to burn monthly to get to about mid game trion is only asking you to grind your soul out it really isnt much of a big deal note the sarcasm once you get to about mid game you make very little progress daily even if you play a lot tge new level update to make the maximum level from 20 to 30 is so grindy now all the pay to win problems have been covered i can now talk about the gaming bits of the game as i said before this game has the basic concepts of a fun mmorpg with dungeons and raids to do this game doesnt really require much teamwork but farming in big groups would be ideal and easier the hardest raids can be soloed sometimes and there are hardly any boss mechanics a game like world of warcraft or rift has raids and dungeons that requires strategic battle plans such as tanking healing pulling aggro dps kiting timing and positioning although tanking is required in the game and dps is as well it doesnt really feel as exciting as an actual raid or dungeon where you feel like you have contributed to the dps charts a carry can easily be invited into your raid and they can just one hit the bosses extremely quickly after the tutorial of the game there are hardly any more quests to complete which makes it boring becuase all you do in the game is shadow tower raids and dungeons adding in questing would really make the game alot stronger than it is and it really needs to be for a pay to win game adding a questline would put more excitement and make the game more interesting the biggest power rank booster in the game are gems which at a certain point of the game is extremely hard to get in lots of amounts to progress onto the worlds you either sell your soul to the demon or spend 30 trion really needs to rethink about how the game will be updated the amount of hours you will spend grinding on this game will become unbelievable if you want to proceed to the end game stages and levels dont touch this game and want to goto end game in a few months unless youre allowed to drain mums credit cardwhen i say it like this im not even joking just play this for fun its meant to be fun for the first 100 hours"

Portal,"honest reviewfirst thing is first i have played path of exile for longer than my hours will show for as i have multiple accounts that have been usedforgottenmuleetc but steam is my main use of the game roughly 100 hours is more accuratewhat i can say honestly with path of exile is that it really gives you a feeling of satisfaction when you have built a design of a character put it together over time and it works theorycrafting became a job title and a hobbie spending hours on end simply coming up with a character that would win the game without even the currency to make it happenso what have a done in the gamejust about every piece of endgame content i am still chasing a deathless uber atziri kill however i have been close on many instancesprosendless character builds it comes down to just how what knowledge you have of the game mechanicspassive tree to get lost inguild community great game to play solo but with others is just on another levelhas softcore and hardcore gameplaynew leagues constantly released this means a new ladder leaderboardplayer hideout to showcase your effortsleveling up crafting masters to increase your crafting optionsover 100 achievementsgreat ways to trade in game and through poetrade 31052016this is not a diablo clone and it really holds its own as a fresh and original gameconsdying in hc can be frustrating crafting rng can make you feel very unlucky at timesmain chat can be full of random trash talkers not alwaysoverallso why do i still playthere is still soo much i can get out of the game and when you least expect it something crazy might drop item or currency that will change your gameplay and style but the satisfying feeling i get fast clearing high level maps at a chance of gaining loot thats so rare it makes you freak out rush to pop it in your inventory Portal to your hideout and logout and pause yourself for a few moments to think i just found a mirror"

Portal,"i love this game so many puzzles and the stories are so dark i love it you can only play 3 characters at once and theyve given you 7 so you have to play through three times to get all of the stories my favourite are the ghost twins and the archeologist if you love thinking puzzles like Portal then youll love this too"

Garrys_Mod,"its a top of the job film maker it has earned itself a high reputation recently its easy to use once you get the hang of it after a few practices if you are really devoted to create your own videosalthough you are going to need a powerful decent computerlaptop to run and save your work with this program considering you need at least 15 gb of space and a high graphics card because less powerful computers arent going to stand a chance the program would still work but the chances of it crashing is a lot likely to happen and loading assets takes a lot while longer overall the quality and graphics are very high moving props and skeletons uses a similar system to Garrys_Mods bone manipulator but slightly more sophisticated and plus this software is produced by valve and inturn they use it to create their videos tutorials are notebly separate from the program so an internet search is required to find them i recommend this software if your computerlaptop is powerful enough to tolerate it"

Dishonored,"this game is simply stunning firstly the gameplay is fluent when you need it to be in epic drop assassinations and a quick escape and dramatic and wellpaced when it needs to be when youre planning how to slink around dunwall or dodging guards like the badass you know you are while the game focuses a lot on its polished stealth mechanics violent overt styles are generally frowned upon and the player may feel especially persuaded to put down the eversoloud pistol and swap back to the good ol fashioned blade and blink the game wants you to use but in saying this i wouldnt precisely call this a negativethe good thing about Dishonored is that you can play it again and again and try a different style everytime ive played through it about 4 times now and even then i realize that there is so much more i can be doing dont like the stealthy style want a bit of a challenge flip the system the bird and run in guns blazing and rats swarming feeling edgy want to be the dark and mysterious character you know you can be equip your dark vision and crossbow and slink around like an actual assassinthe plot is predictable but youll easily see past that when you immerse yourself in the lore rich world of dunwall littered like candy wrappers at a park youll find all sorts of books clippings and conversations that hint and tease at the world of dunwall drunken sailor chants tell you of the dark and violent histories of the city intelligent scriptures of scholarly standard describe the mysterious outsider and small talk between the servants of mansions will tell you of the current affairs generally murder plague and povertyand you cant leave out the confronting and generally awesome artwork and landscape brilliantly crafted dishonoureds graphics do well at setting a dark and gloomy mood that brings a fantastic view to the steampunk genre tall crooked buildings decorated in pipes cogs and other steampunk personifications make dunwall so lovable and real hound pits pub flyers hang like dead bodies from notice boards weathered walkways are tainted with putrid rats and corpses homes are only made warm by the people inside as they lack food and security overall buy this game play it 67 times and immerse yourself in the stunning world of arkane studios Dishonored"

Loadout,"note while i only have 29 hours on the pc version ive put in over 100 hours on a different platform the long awaited and the missing piece of the metal gear solid series is finally here and its a masterpiece metal gear solid v the phantom pain tells the story of big boss descent into villainy and what makes him the character that we know from metal gear 1 and 2 running on the fox engine the games visuals are great and the gameplay and optimization are top notch and from what ive played so far on the pc version the game runs very well the game is running on almost a constant 60fps except during some heavy action moments with my settings completely maxed out although one of my gripes with the pc version is when using the keyboard and mouse ive found that the idroid can be frustrating to use as there is no mouse control in the menus other than that the pc version of the game is near perfect the gameplay aspect of the game is much better in almost every way compared to other games in the series and has now become openworld the gameplay is very similar to peace walker with a Loadout menu allowing you to change your gear before every mission the gunplay and controls are an improvement over past games too with the weapon and item selection chosen using a wheel display and subsections but within all these new additions to the game youll find the classic metal gear gameplay that youre used to from the cqcinterrogations to using a cardboard box to sneak past enemies and aiming for s ranking missions the game introduces buddies buddies can assist you during operations in the field dhorse gives you a faster means of travel ddog can be used you distract enemies scout enemies plants or animals and even kill theres also quiet a storybased character that is completely optional and can assist in missions as a sniper to either kill or tranquilize enemies from afar and finally theres dwalker dwalker can do almost everything that the player can do on foot you can fire a weapon sneak around enemies or even cqc them and it can also be used a means of travel if you prefer it over using dhorse another new addition to the phantom pain is mother base mother base is the home of diamond dogs and just like in peace walker it can be used to develop weapons and items for the player to use ingame but unlike in peace walker in the phantom pain the player can walk around mother base and interact with their soldiers that they recruit on the battlefieldfrom the eighty hours that ive played there are no issues in the gameplay that stand out and overall its the best of the seriesbut of course metal gear games arent all about the gameplay the captivating yet sometimes confusing story also plays a huge role in the appeal of the games the phantom pain tells the story of big boss descent into villainy and is the missing piece of the gap between peace walker and metal gear but the way the game tells the story is whats important and is an issue in this case the long cutscenes that can last for several minutes that fans of the series have come to know and love are missing this time around instead replaced with cassette tapes that fill the player in on the details of a situation or event that has occured in the storycutscene this can leave the players wanting more as the cinematography in the series is known to be exceptional but instead they are left to listen to dozens of tapes while this doesnt necessarily affect the overall story it does affect the flow of the plot in my opinion newcomers to the series dont need to be worried about not understanding whats going on too as the events leading up to the phantom pain are explained in the tapes another issue with the story is that it can leave the players dissatified in the end but thats something i wont go into as it will contain spoilers but overall hideo kojima has outdone himself yet again and has created yet another masterpiece of a game if this really is his last metal gear game then he has ended the series with a bang and one that any player whether they are a veteran of the series or a newcomer can enjoyprosa hideo kojima gameincredible gameplaygreat visualswell optimizedimmense level of detailconsstoryending may be unsatisfactory to some1010"

Terraria,"Terraria is an indie game similar to minecraft but a lot larger and complex Terraria is set in a 2 dimensional world with many creatures that want to kill you the only real objective in this game is to survive you start with some basic tools and a guide but the rest is up to you Terraria uses a retro pixelated look that gives the game that simple feel there are many weapons and potions you will encounter to assist you on you journey and with the prefix system this creates a huge variety in the weapons Terraria has a multiplayer option setting up a multiplayer server is an unreasonably lengthy process of installing the serverexe and hamachi making sure everyone is on the hamachi network etc Terraria is a great survival game with a lot of playtime and content 86100"

Team_Fortress_2,"very realistic and challenging in addition to its maps puzzles and objectives make this zombie game a true experiencein my opinion this game is designed to be for hardcore video gamers so griefers and slowwitted people stop reading nowso far the game has amazing combat scenarios where you cant just do something very stupid to get out of the situation say crowd surfing a bunch of zombies or slipping past them because there was just one tiny opening in their swarm this makes it difficult because it slows down our instincts because weve gotten used to fast paced shooters like Team_Fortress_2 call of duty left 4 dead and the counterstrike series in which it gives us a truly unique experience where we have to stick together conserve our supplies sparringly and work as a team in order to fully enjoy this game"

The_Community,"dayz is probably one of the most played openworld zombie games to date it was one of the most successful mods in history and although the standalone isnt looking so crashhot now its definetely headed in the right direction my advice would be to buy this game right now even if your not really happy with the current buildi only say this because the difference between the mod and this game is vastly different and as such the developers are trying to take this in a more realistic direction this wontbe agreeable to everyone of course and sometimes i think theyve taken it too far and retracted from the games appeal despite what i know theyre aiming for i think they have to consider that this is just a game and shouldnt be crafted to a point where The_Community no longer enjoys it nevertheless id recommend it time and time again as a great away to pass the hours with friends through blood sweat and tears usually in that order"
Tf2,"the only reason this game doesnt have a higher metascore is because it was reviewed when it was first released in flashback articles youll see prevoulsy scorning critics giving it 10s because its improved so much maps have been added crates like Tf2 weapon skins so many community contributions map tweaks gameplay upgrades new game mode the list continues this game needs more players all noobs welcome the community can teach you the tools of the trade even if uyoure hopeless d have fun on csgo deffinitely worth anyones time in my case 400 hours of time right now anyway"

Portal,"Portal 2 is a fun and interactive game that challenges you to think outside the box obviously its the sequal to the original Portal so graphics and ui have been increased significantly you play as a test subject for aperture laboratories where they test the potential of beings for the future on the journey you go through many tests set by glados genetic lifeform and disk operating system while observing the environment trying to find a way out of the facility overall it is a great game for anyone looking for a puzzling journey full of surprises"

Loadout,"ive really enjoyed insurgency purchased it recently for myself and friends as a christmas present with the steam saleone of those friends described it as very intense id have to agree it seems pretty realistic for a game it reminded me of an updated americas army game which had the same realistic 13 bullets and youre dead mechanic and thats a good thing if you like some realism it reminds me a little of paintball except better accuracy and with real weapons the suppression feature is really cool and reminds me of the effect that paintballs whizzing around your head hasi much prefer it to the various cs as the recoilbullet spreading seems more realistic and the Loadouts are not related to success in the game its just a fixed budget of points and weight to distribute how you see fit this makes it more newbiefair the allocation of members of your team into a fixed breakdown of pickable roles is good because it prevents an accumulation of snipers on teams often the support or machinegunner role goes unused which suits me as i enjoy playing it once you get the bipod setup lying prone behind some concealment or cover its a lot of fun because the recoil is gone and you can suppress or kill it suits a somewhat older gamer like me with slower reaction times because as you fire you are suppressing and then you can eventually hone in and mow them down heavy armor often extends your life a bitspeaking of concealment vs cover that is definitely something you learn to adapt to its a lot of fun shooting through some corrugated iron or wooden boxes especially with ap bullets to kill someone crouching behind themthe emphasis on achieving objectives to win points for taking objectives and killing opposition at the objective instead of just raw kd ratio makes for a great teamwork environment if you snipe you snipe to capture the objective countersniping or covering the objective its really fun with good teamwork especially if someone who knows what they are doing is instructing players what to do and boosting moralei dont even notice that the engine is supposedly old at least it was inexpensive and ran on my machine looks good enough compared to old games i am familiar with"
Tf2,"all ive got to say about this game is that it is probably one of the funniest first person shooters out there right next to Tf2 well that isnt all i have to say if your looking for a game with almost unlimitless types of guns this is the game for you and with the weapon slots you unlock through the game you can have a sniper rifle rocket launcher pistol and shotgun on you at the same time without making you slow like most other games would plus the fact that some guns when you reload them you throw them away into an enemy and it explodes so to sum it all up great game"
Team_Fortress_2,"the formula of Team_Fortress_2 is the same as that established the original forget the traditional matches deathmatch in which wins one committing the highest number of deaths here it is essential to work together each player will be part of blue or red which tends to contain the same number of participants in team games that are balanced if a team has more players than the other they will automatically redistributed in the next game for now those are two game modes the traditional capture the flag it is here that a briefcase containing secret files which must be stolen from the base of the opposing team and taken to the headquarters of his team and taking control points the latter sutra some variations as one in which the team must defend their area before the time runs out before the opposing team to dominate or that both teams capture control points simultaneously and defend their own territory the simplicity of the game makes it more enjoyable and dynamic allowing the player to stay tuned to the nearest opponents and not goofing die to capture a control point for example just stay on marked until a bar fills area the more units of the same team the faster the point will be taken at times like this strategy is what counts the team that is more balanced with characters of attack defense and support working cooperatively tends to win the game more easily why is this important communication between the players either via voice and through instant messaging an unforgettable teamas previously mentioned there are nine distinct character traits they are the scouts fast but vulnerable incendiary able to put your enemies on fire breaker equipped with grenade launchers and landmines crude the toughest of all but also the slowest engineer builder sentry guns doctor who restores the energy of the other players sniper able to inflict critical damage to long distances and spy who has the ability to masquerade as any other character facilitating infiltrationeach character has an arsenal of weapons itself plus unique abilities like double jump or scout the power of invisibility spy all this allows each team to prepare their own defense and combat tactics the possibilities are virtually endless depending on the map however certain tactics are more efficient than othersfor more frantic action that is you can get acquainted with Team_Fortress_2 in a matter of minutes a low learning curve is a big advantage especially for players less accustomed with online games simply connect to a server and taking action without those screens customization and configuration explanatory videos help you understand each objective without major complications it is an ideal game for any time either for short or long and uncompromising and competitive matches of course who does not have much skill with games of first person shooter and get into a server full of experienced players which can be common in Team_Fortress_2 eventually finishing matches with the score reset which can be quite frustrating at this point he lacks training areas or specific servers for beginners cartoon in game shapethe animated feature the incredibles was clearly an inspiration for the team of artists from valve which seem not hide admiration for cartoony and bold characteristic also of the iron giant from the director of the pixar movie the visual design of the characters and cartoon perfectly combined with the uncompromising and fun proposal for Team_Fortress_2 the fighters are also provided for you the forward scout for example the most agile of all is young and slender while the gunner brute wielding a giant machine gun is frowning all move with a lightness and smoothness unparalleled revealing animation work technically perfect that owes nothing to the work of pixar all that style combined with the frantic action worthy cartoon makes the game even more fun than it was before the high degree of violence of the original was maintained leaving even more comical incessant battles regarding the sound part the game needs more songs aside from the main menu the action does not track soundtrack being restricted only to the sounds of bullets and explosives many taken from the own halflife 2 which unlike Team_Fortress_2 has a much more serious issue the contrast becomes inevitable because you would expect from a game with visual cartoon drawings are classic hanna barbera sound effects"

Dishonored,"Dishonored is a epic stealth game it goes from magic to freaking teleporting it is so fun the assassinating is good and it is a good game over all i would give it a 8 out of 10 stars"
Terraria,"unturned is an entertaining game here give my opinion of the game unturned is a survival game like day z because youre a guy you have to build your house and collect things for their survival and the cities are infected zombies you need food drinks and antibiotics to reduce the detoxification detoxification increases when hit by a zombie the game is fun to play in multiplayer because having friends makes you share your items with others and has to use a lot of cooperation so that all players have things necessary to defend against waves of zombies when i started to survive in the game i thought it would be a game like rust minecraft Terraria etc but i found it different there are many more things to do and what matters most in this game is the way to be able to have enough things to survive from when you start to when you finish the path between the two is as much fun in this game never give up on the game as always will have something to help you succeed the concluion is that it is one of the best games that are survival and is in beta the game is complete when the probability of finding the most entertaining game that was in beta will be higher keep updating unturned having a good life"

The_Community,"not even worth playing anymore it has gone way to pay to win when i first started this it was actually viable i just recently came back and unless youre going to pay loads of then youre not going to get very far most trapsmonsters and other stuff you can get for your castle for defences are locked and youll need to either buy the infinite pack or unlock each one using ingame special currency which costs real and having to validate your castle is what annoys me the most since you have use your own hero to validate which means you have to clear your castle without dying if you die then it wont validate you can pay to get The_Community to validate your castle but that also costs because you can only use special ingame currency inorder for The_Community to validate it for you you can ask your clan to validate it for you if you can manage to get in one but almost all clans have requirements so goodluck with that you need around 500100 crowns for people to acutally accept you into a clan which takes a considerable amount of time and fustration since if you lose in any sort of way you lose crown and quite a lot of crowns depending on where you try to attack and people can plunder your castle so that also means you can still lose crowns even when youre offline or online unless you got loads of cash to throw at this game dont bother"

Csgo,"this game can be good at times dont get me wrong it can also be enjoyable and playing with friends is great too but there are some majour issues that need to be addressed for example for some reason and not just me when ever your ping starts to fck up so does your fps you can be running normally at ultra at 60fps on a 980 like me and then just randomly get fps drops that you think is just ping lag before you realise nope its your computer i know somebody with a 980ti that also has the same problem thats not the only problem for some reason i had these huge lights that were apearing out of no where and almost making me blind the pc au servers are also terrible at least there dedicated this time but still bad you can one round have the best ping and then next awful ping and my internet isnt even that bad and i have australian internet ahha the games killing system and aiming could also be improved doesnt help that im not that good of an aim RIRE but still after playing Csgo for example i can be doing well in that and finding that when i get killed its oh okay fair enough and when i get a kill well that was good in bo3 its like when you get killed omg what the fck hes hacking omg thats so heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t and when you get a kill no way i got that and thats just a few things to name its also very buggy and you can tell that it has been rushed either that or its just a bad console peasent to pc port i had high hopes for this game and im not impressed at all i did enjoy zombies though and found that enjoyable and is most likely keeping me from refunding it its just mp needs to be improved alot cheers"

The_Community,"one of few apocalypse survival games that truly grows from The_Community the dev works on this everyday and is always looking for feedback and opinions on how the game is shaped also constantly putting out strawpolls to The_Community and listens to usunturned is played how you want example if you only want pve you can select your server and if you want a pvp experience with your pve you can select pvp enabled on your server and yes you can host your own servers on your computerit starts out like many other apocalypse survival games you start out with your fists and 4 slots for your inventory you have a lot of places you can wander to when you spawn like a cabin camp small town military base and many more your main mission when you start is to grab a melee some food with drink and a backpack once youve acquired these necessities you may wish to find a gun if you want to pvp or you may want to collect seeds to start a farm or even start chopping down trees to make yourself a cozy place to spend the nightthe pvp system is great also server hosts can select if players can bring in loot from their server best for pvp or not be able to bring loot in best for pve immersion their is a leaning system so you can peek corners also you can also shoot out of cars but not from the drivers seat of course load some of your buddies in the trunk of your truck and do a hillbilly driveby if you wishthe towns are well structured for pvp also their are lot of cqc battles to be fought and also small hills for sniping but snipers can be easily flanked if you dont post up rightbase raiding is also important in pvp too people on public servers will build structured bases equipped with sniper pits plenty of windows and escape routes you must observe a players base and attack it strategically you never know how many players may be in therenow time to farm my crops and build my base i recommend you do so also"

Terraria,"wow soo much to say about this game where to start well for starters no matter how many other better games you find on steam skyrim the witcher wild hunt any other game you will never get as much enjoyment out of them as you will Terraria you will never beat the classics such as minecraft no matter how many times you tell yourself you dont like it anymore but tbh Terraria is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing amazing you think the producers of minecraft have it hard of course they do its a 3d game everythings difficult even tho Terraria is a 2d game it has so much more content including bosses weapons biomes enemies items npcs tools ores and a lot more like srrsly you think or minecraft then think of everything is has Terraria has it but about 5 times more especially items Terraria has like 50 times more items then minecraft minecraft just simply cant compete with Terraria you spawn into a randomly generated world with a shortsword pickaxe and an axe you find a tree chop it down make a house make some background walls so enemies cant spawn in there then with the rest of the wood a workbench some tools to mine better ores to make better weapons look at wiki or do it yourself spawn an easy boss and destroy it with the amazing new weapons you have scavenged and made collect its drops to save up copper silver gold platnium coins to buy unique items from npcs such as awesome weapons and humorous items to make your gameplay even more entertaining and just when you think its over a meteor lands you go find its location attempt to mine it without getting killed from burning to death or demolished by meteor heads use the meteor armor weapons and tools to go deeper underground to find and mine some gold once you have the gold you make ingots and gold armor and weapons get better weapons to go aall the way down to the underworld aka hell RIRE to mine some hellstone make a giant pathway thought the underworld kill a voodo demon and get a guide doll drop it in lava and summon the wall of flesh with multiple attempts to kill it you will then basically have a new game killing the wall of flesh unlocked hardmode harder enemies new bosses destroy the demon altars with the hammer the wall of flesh drops which spawns in new better stronger ores to mine anyway i highly recommend buying this game hours and hours of fun i just this game is amazing please buy this gametell all your friends about this gameget them to buy this gamebuy this game for themwhatever you can you need this game to end your sad little life and make it a good oneanyway take care"

Css,"half lifethe game that started it alleven though it was made back in 1998it is still a gemi dont vote games by their graphicsbut by their gameplaythis was an immersingwonderful and addicting experience for mei lived another lifein this gamethe game has everything a gamer asks for immersing gameplayindulging storya nice selection of weaponsand graphics that were thrilling in the year it was madebut are all old noweven now this title holds up till todayshining its glory as the first game that valve ever madeand a game that changed gaming itselfnow i will have a look at the main aspects of a good gamewarning a little bit of spoiling aheadgameplay excellenteither you are blasting monsters from an alternate dimension or just trying to pick off those squad men who just dont seem to put you in peacethere were a few places where it did get a little bit boringbut that was because i couldnt wait until i would experience something newthe terrain in the game is nicely madeeven though it is pretty old due to the date it was madethe places you travel through are pretty differentyou wont be bored of seeing the same old place over and over againthe game itself is nicely balancedexcept that they could have put less ammo in the gameso you wouldnt always have a gun loaded 910story a nice story is told throughout the gameand that is guaranteed to keep you hooked until the last moment of the gameeven though it doesnt have any cutscenesit tells its story just wonderfullyit keeps you in first person mode all of the timeso it makes you live the character all the way through the storyall the stuff that is happening in the game seems kind of logicalas if could happen in real lifethe characters are well done as wellfor they act as normal people would actthey are as they should bethey speakfighthelp you and do other stuffand there is a wierdly acting character which stands out in the gamebut i will let you figure that out for yourselfthere arent the same scientists all over and over againbut we cant say this with security guardsthe enemies are widely assorted and wont make you think that they are dumbbut play as they are real and trying to get youno dull moment will get you in this gameso dont be afraid of experiencing any in this game 1010weapons there is a wide assort of weapons to fit you in this gamebut do not expect too muchthere are the main weapons you would except from a game like thisand maybe a little bit more due to an monster invasion going on all around youthe game has its own signature weapon a crowbarbut that is also the only melee weapon that you can use in this gamewhile you progress through the game you will find weaponsbut there arent manyso every weapon you getyou make use ofbecause all of them are uniqueas i wont spoil much herei will just tell you that there are weapons from the pistol even to such weapons like a rocket launcherand a few of alien techologies are found in the game as wellyou will find yourself exploring all around you to get some ammo for your favourite weaponbecause it gives you tons of ammo for a wide selection of weaponsand the ammo that you need may not be findable anywherewhen you shoot a gun it feels like you shoot a gunmeaning that you will find the gun bouncing back in your hand when you shoot itand you can hear the sound for gun firing is well done as wellbut when shooting a rocket launcher you will not bounce backbut if you move while shooting it the rocket will go wrong and hit another spotdepending on which way you movedeven if you dont have any ammoyou get to use a alien techonlogy which has unlimited ammoeven though it recharges over timeit doesnt take much of it and it has special abilities 8510enemies from the headcrab even to the final bossthe enemies are nicely balancedyou are slowly introduced to each enemy and its tactiCsso you know what to use on it and what to doyou probably wont find yourself facing a unnormally big army of enemies if you arent well armedonce you learn the tactics the enemies use it is easy to defeat themjust keep a look out for themor otherwise you might find yourself in quite a picklei wouldnt say that the enemies are hardyou can use the terrain to your advantage as welluckilyone group of your enemies is fighting anotherso you can use that to your advantage as wellif you find the right momentwinkbut i wouldnt rely on such stuffi would just get myself a nice arsenal of weapons and go defeat that crowd of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit sthere are a few weapons which have unlimited ammoand i feel that is unbalanceddont go prancing around as a pony as wellyou will get your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kickedthere are flying enemiescrawling enemieswalking enemies and big enemiesthe crawling ones are easyjust keep a look out for them so they dont get the jump on youthe flying ones need the right weaponslike a zoom in crossbowfor they fly around and shoot at you and when you get close to them they just fly awaythe walking ones are easy enoughjust keep a shotgun on your hand and you will be okbut the big ones need a plana strategy and a assault of weapons 9510graphics from black mesa labs to even alien fields of doomthis game is amazingit now has its own hd modelsso a few things look better when the models are turned onany computer will be able to get this game runningso why not jump in it alreadyand as this game was made in 1998dont expect modern graphicsbut that couldnt stop you from playing this gamecould itthe terrain is kind of blocky and the characters as wellbut if you look past that point get ready to indulge into a game that made gaming as it is todayand the graphics arent that badeverything is quite understandablethey have made the graphics the best way they couldand i dont blame them because i dont vote a game by its graphicsand if you cant stand the graphics there is a source version of the gamemade by valve as wellthere is a version made by fans as wellbut i wouldnt recommend that because it is modified a bitbut the original is the best in my opinion as it is the completly unmodified version of half lifeand the best out thereof coursethat is if you look past the graphicsthere are even little details specified in the originl gamebut they wont be seen so good and will be kind of blurredbut be sure to keep your eyes litfor there are many leversbuttons and things like that throughout the gamethat blend in with the enviroment 8510overall look even though this game is datedit is definently not deadbe sure to pick this game up on a saleor even buy it at its full pricebecause this game is worth every cent you pay for iti loved the gameit really got me pulled in and the story was just stunningi loved every place i came upon to in this gameseeking new adventure and traveling on into the deep unknownthis game is filled with interesting moments and is guaranteed to keep you aroused until the very endingthis is a great classic and everyone should play itit is an experience not to be missedit changed gaming as it is nowand was a hit in gaming and it still isa wonderful game final score 910reviewed by ultrix"

Dishonored,"by now youre probably aware of the games gimmick its an emotionally punishing morality based knock off of dark heart apocalypse now masquerading as a generic fps the game aims to put you into a series of morally conflicting positions situations you would likely have faced in many other fpss but it tries to humanise your opponents and confront you with the ramifications of your actions cute if you want to get a better idea of what the themes are and how theyre implemented extra credits has two good videos about it on yt one with one without spoilers if you can put up with the pretentious highmorality fapping to the gameso lets look at this one three levels the morality mechanic the themes of morality and ptsd from a narrative perspective and the actual quality of the game play otherwisethe morality mechanicthe themes of morality manifest themselves as game mechanics when you periodically come across " moral " situations and have to make a decision about how to proceed heres how theyve utterly heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ed it up at times and one scene in particular everyone keeps raving about youre presented the illusion of choice but no actual choice you do the one thing the game lets you do and are treated to what i assume was meant to be an emotional cutscene to punish you for it i can not feel bad for doing the thing the game required this isnt console players blubbering into their controllers this is the pc master race weve been dropping chemical weapons on civilians since postal you got ta bring something better than that the majority of the time the game misleads you about your options there are hidden " high morality " alternatives in a lot of cases sure its nice for the game to put explicit and hidden alternatives in but the thing is you can just play the game the way the game tells you to and it still works fine theres no reason to look for alternatives in fact idve been more morally invested had i seen the highmorality option and still felt i needed to take the low morality choice and finally and probably most egregiously the moral choices you make seem so to have absolutely no impact on the game why would i make the moral choice here im trying to get from this level to the next one and i will shoot a civilian in the head if thats what the game says i need to do to progress the story i absolutely loathe ending changes based on a morality meter a la bioshock Dishonored but if you implement a morality mechanic it needs to at least change the gameplay somehow the entire game seems to assume that everyone who plays a game like bf or cod must spend their entire time vacillating over how they could solve each problem in a moral way i like i think most normal pc gamers just did what the game said i should do im not interested in the lives of npcs who dont even get a name tag i dont care its a game its a challenge to get from a to b you need either really good storytelling or something particularly special to make me feel things or harder still to make my feelings factor into my game play style the narrative themesthe terrible implementation into the gameplay not withstanding the artistic value here is pretty high the story is kind of interesting despite its obvious plotholes the way they represent constant descent the psychosis colour schemes loading screen accusations the 4th wall breaking theyre not all immediately obvious but theyre there and theyre pretty well thought out and itll give you plenty to mull over and wonder about on a second playthrough while were at it the general visuals are pretty sweet actually so good job therethe actual gameplayi wont say that graphics dont matter or that narrative doesnt matter but i will say and i will defend this to the hilt they matter less than mechanics a game with a pretty poor delivery can still be good if its mechanics are solid but the opposite is rarely true spec ops the line does not have good mechanics i mean yes its so so agonisingly obvious that this is a port from a console game and it has what are pretty standard mechanics for a console game i guess so fine but im sitting on pc wondering why i spend half my time hiding behind a bench or wall or ornamental plant pot taking turns to fire at enemies who are also hiding behind whatever debris magically happened to be there the most tactical thing in the game is blowing up explosive barrels or taking advantage of the ridiculously contrived breakingglasstounleashanavalancheofsand mechanic the whole handful of times the game remembered it wanted that to be a thing a fortunately all the miniguns scattered around shopping centres can be turned around and used to mow down waves of suicidal enemies your npcsbut the worst the absolute worst and this i can not forgive a game are your npcs in theory you have a sniper and a heavy and you can light up a target for them to take out yeah good luck with that theyre useless as all hell they get in your way a lot by the time they eliminate a target for you you could just have done it yourself since you need to have the reticle on the target anyway to tag them but to top it off if they get shot you need to run in and revive them and they have no idea of how to not get shot heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit stealth these guys assume that not only are you going to speedrunngun this game but that you will somehow provide much better cover for them than mere concrete or sandbags ever could so eschew both in favour of just sitting out in plain sight possibly the worst example of npcs ruining any hope you have of making good tactical choices is one scene where you see a yacht in the desert plenty of openings no aerial cover and a reasonable amount of open ground between you and it open ground which has an inbound truck load of enemies i wanted to stay put in my indestructible aircraft hull with a box of nades a box or ammo high ground advantage and crucially one small controllable entrance but my highly trained delta force sidekicks thought our only hope for survival would be to run like idiots for the yacht and then stay put half way when i didnt run with them needless to say they got mowed down and i lost the game for not reviving them fast enough if the game had let me idve shot them in the first 5 minutes and gone on alone but alas the point of the game seems less about killing the enemies and staying alive than it does basically babysitting two idiots with the survival instincts of a screamapillar through a war zone dodging bullets to shoot them full of adrenalinfinal thoughtsover all the idea of the game was fine - put players in a situation where they question their actions despite playing a game or even question their actions in all games the problem is it didnt work must like the " would you kindly " scene in bioshock it didnt work because i did what i did because thats how you make game progress the designers may have tried to go meta and accept that players ragequitting would just be one of their " endings " or try to argue that the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit mechanics are there to fill you with a sense of unease to foreshadow the descent into madness theme but really it didnt work good idea implement it better the visuals were stunning and some of the little bits and pieces of depression were nice like the slowly decaying soldier in the menu screen but the core mechanics were heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit the gameplay was highly linear it was all cover based shooting the shooting itself was clunky and frustrating the npcs are worse than the enemy and even the storyline needed tidying up if youre making an fps make an fps once youve managed to do that well then we can talk about themes and story but at the end of the day morality does not belong in games especially not shooters they"
Evolve,"plague inc Evolved is probably the first game that has made me actually fear for my safety its also the first game that allows me to destroy humanity with diseases like RIRE and weed which i had named myself for a small laughwhile the game is in early access it seems to be mostly done with only a few things missing such as multiplayer and the tutorial but that doesnt stop it from being a good game with what it hasthe game is in early access and is based off the popular smartphone app with the same name and well yes you could play that for 2 but you wouldnt have as many featuresachievements theres a ton of them or visuals since the game looks great on pc the app is however a good means as to see how the game works game explanation basicly you select a type of disease all of which work differently you then select a starting country to infect your first victim and as your virus spreadsinfectskills ect you gain points which you can then spend to gain upgrades which do a viraty of things from allowing it to infect certain animals to making it more resistant to heat or cold which can effect the outcome and reaction of the world greatly your first time playing will probably come as a quick defeat as you learn which upgrades are best at what time in your diseases development and i would love to go into detail about my strategy but this is a review not a guide dso is the game worth the 1499 price tag in its current state the answer is probably not unless youre a big fan of the smartphone game or a fan of these types of games the problem with the game in my opinion is that most of the diseases feel the same they do all have differences but most are so small you barely feel a difference between them which can cause the game to get boring fast the zombie and mindworm diseases which are new feel very well done providing a fresh new experence due to their completely different upgrades and playstyle from the rest of the diseases and if other diseases were to follow suit and get a redesign to make them all unique from each other i would be much more willing to recommend this game for its pricewhile i cant fully recommend the game for the price right now i can only hope the game will grow to be worth 1499 because it is a good game it just needs a little more grabbing power to keep people coming back for more and although im not quite sure how multiplayer will work it could just be the thing to do it thanks for reading"

Tf2,"guns 2 the second duel for the entirety that i had played feels like guns the duel but with more regulation as a shield trooper i didnt feel clunky at moments i actaully was able to get around faster than the other two female classes silent avengers are a remnant of the original guns the game played as armored core would if they mixed it with Tf2 and warframe the pve is well made in a arcadey beat em up fashion as you kill enemies they drop health and ammo till you progress to the next room level etc shield troopers even with the shield still fell short to the enemies massive count though even with 3 other partners so its not the easiest game to win the cash shop is pretty standard and all the guns have little to no difference in base dps oh and dont pick shield trooper because if you do youll have to pay ingame currency for the other characters a solid 81100"

Tf2,"Tf2 is one of the best free to play games on steam"
The_Community,"like many coop games this is great with friends and terrible with random people i will admit however after playing for a while random peoples is not as bad but playing with friends is still way more funon the positive side the game engine if very sound excellent graphics its fast paced and fun to play it has multiple difficulty levels ranging from seriously too easy to omg this is too hard so just about eveyrone can enjoy it none of the dlc is required to play the game and if your friend has more dlcs than you easily play with them its pretty slick how you can always play with your friends if everyone owns the base gameon the negative side the game can be a bootfest with random people i feel the developer could easiely do quite a bit to make it not so terrible and make it easier to meet like minded players if youre playing with freinds that being i have meet cool people and all but that takes a bit of persistance additionally while the game itself seems to be solid theres an ongoing issue with the developer where the developer stated at multiple times there would never be microtransactions and after pushing out wave after wave of not the best dlc they added a micro tranaction system some people have an issue with this some people feel they made amends and some just do not care additonally the devs seem to lie and manipulate The_Communitythis game gets regular updates some of the updates are great some of the updates not so much adding missions weapons characters things to the game is great the weapon rebalance the manner in which weapon skins were added adding improvements for people who bought an exclusive dlc thats no longer offered amoung other things were not so great i like the regular updates but i dont like having to drink regularly to be able handle the changesthis is a good game so good ive bought the base game for multiple other people to get them into it i however find it increasingly harder and harder to support the devs and regretable to get people into it also since payday 3 is annouced ill probably choose not get into that after the mess the devs made in this game"
Tf2,"awesome game completely free to play but you can get a ton of hats if you go premium Tf2 is a pretty balanced game toodefinitely recommend this game"
Tf2,"es un juego muy divertido lo puedes jugar muchas horas porque su modo de jugabilidad es muy adictivo entretenido y lo mas importante no se vuelve muy repetitivo ademas es un free2play lo que hace que su comunidad de juego sea inmensa lo unico malo es que al ser free2play hay muchas personas y eso genera que algunos servers tengan un gran lag pero eso finalmente no es culpa de Tf2 un juego muy recomendado para la gente que no quiere gastar dinero y tambien para la gente que si quiere gastar dinero porque puede tener articulos que los demas no tienen pero siempre con un equilibrio de ser justo con los dos tipos de jugadores muy recomendado"

Css,"if you want a fun game to do whatever you want in this is the game for you i reccomend that you buy Css with this game because otherwise many maps you play on or download will be missing textures the game is insanly fun to play with friends and i will continue to play it until i find another game like it the game runs very easily as it is running on the hl2 engine which is very old a must have for your steam library and i think that this game will continue to grow into the future and will be continue to be modded for a very long time"
Evolve,"risk of rain is a brilliant platformerrougelite the main thing with this game that pulls me into this game is how easily i can switch from being underpowered to overpowered and then back again in split seconds mostly from getting too cocky when i have certain powerups p its genuinely a hard game and i love it for that reason the music is a selling point as well sort of a rockyelectronicambient thingthe difficulty scales just right for me it gives me a good 25 minutes to do what i need to do in each level so i can do either a quick pickupandplay run or i could do a good 40 min run to rarely get to the last level plus this game actually makes me want to collect every single powerup and monster log just for the little storys you get alonethe only gripe i have with it is how complicated it is to connect with friends when i want to connect with a friend i have to use a program called EvolveEvolvehqcom that gives me and my friends a temp ip address and even that fails some of the timeall in all this is a solid game that rates highly on my games list"
Garrys_Mod,"i would recommend this game to anyone as there are many different features and games that can by played on Garrys_Mod i would rate it a 910 because it can be a bit annoying it you dont have the right resource packs for prop hunt and other games"
Dota_2,"Dota_2 awesome game play it"
Tf2,"Tf2 is my favorite its soo cool"
Tf2,"ok so all my friends asked me to review this game but i dont want it be as long as the borderlands 2 review so lets use an ign structure the presentation of this game is amazing the characters art style and music are all amazing to be honest i think this is the 2nd best game valve have ever produced and that is because of the detail all the characters are balanced and holy fun to play as each character is completely different letting you play the game in 9 different ways now about the trading aspect just look at mine and my friend hugobosscat inventory and that should tell you about our opinion on the trading so in a whole Tf2 is one of the best games ever made and its free"
Evolve,"oh borderlands 2 your sarcasim and crap ton of weapons has kept me playing on my ps3 for 90 hours and my computer 40 hours this game in just 1 word guns and on the topic of guns this game a has geometric craptonne of guns some people go for the best they can find but rascals like me farm for the legendariesseraphs and pearlescents this game took me around 40 hours to complete but i stuffed around and did sidequests and other stuff along the way so you could probably finish it a lot quicker im also not that good so thats also probably why it took so long but i didnt even mention the 6 playable characters or vault hunters they are all very unique so ill go over my favourites in short detail the siren is a character that controls the field of battle she uses her action skill phaselock to trap enemies in a big purple ball thing she has amazing skills mostly found in the motion tree like subsequence which after you have killed an enemy in phaselock it moves to another target or the final skill of the cataclysim tree ruin which causes enemies to get slagged zapped corroded and lit on fire while in your phaselock these 2 skills paired up with converge suck nearby enemies in into the phaselock can be a deadly combination of skills she is probably my 2nd favourite my favourite vault hunter is the assasin zer0 he is a stealthy warrior and with the action skill and skill trees this shows through zer0 has 3 skill trees obviously sniping cunning and bloodshed so basically you can be a sniper a ninja or a samurai my favourite skill tree is the cunning skill tree ninja skill tree it rEvolves heavily around his action skill deception deception is when you lay out a decoy of yourself while you become invisible the enemies can not see you while youre in deception so they will shoot your decoy you become visible after you shoot an enemy or the 5 second timer on your deception runs out anyhow back to the skill tree the middle skill of cunning is really amazing it is called death mark after you stab or melee an enemy they will have a little zero above their head notifying you that youve marked them if you mark a target then all damage is 20 stronger to that enemy the final skill of cunning is death bl0ss0m which when youre in deception if you press f on your keyboard you throw a handfull of kunai little sharp knifes this does so much damage its insane but one of the best parts of this skill is that doesnt stop your deception and it can apply death mark which means that if you dont want to get up close and stab them to get that death mark you can throw your kunai instead borderlands 2 is a great game and i highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of fps or shoot and loot gamesby the way my favourite weapon is the pitchfork sniper rifle"
Tf2,"i think you guys must play this game because its awsome funit has 9 classes to choose from and theres thousands of maps inside Tf2you can play with bosses such as saxton haledemo linkbemo pan and more"
Team_Fortress_2,"Team_Fortress_2 is a fun action firstperson shooter with a cartoon like style it has a good variety of classes my favourite is the spy and has loads of cool items and weapons to unlock it has lots of great maps and fun game modes from man vs machine to capture to the flag this is a game i totally recommened unless your 6 6 year olds are too young to be playing violent games in conclusion if you dont have steam money and you want a fun cartoonic shooter to play than this is perfect for you"

The_Community,"despite its initial detractors j r r tolkiens novel the lord of the rings is revered by many fans and is one of the bestselling novels of all time its an extraordinary story that has spawned three extraordinary movies but managed only a few ordinary videogames until nowon the surface middleearth shadow of mordor owes a lot of its gameplay to the inspiration derived from the successful batman arkham and assassins creed series of games players are given an open world setting within mordor to explore and innumerable orcs and urukhai to battle and it ' s these battles that set shadow of mordor apart from its influences the combat mechanism is a familiar combination of hit and counter but with an added " last stand " minigame that allows the character to parry a deathblow to remain in the fight winning the minigame and surviving feels truly epicwhat ' s more mordor introduces a fascinating nemesis system for players to contend with enemy combatants stand to gain promotion and effectively level up from defeating you or from the death of one of their rivals if you flee from combat which is a perfectly valid option when faced against a dozen enemies you will also be taunted should you face the same foes againwhile not perfectdead orcs should remain deadit can be enthralling especially as more abilities become availableoutside of the gameplay there ' s also something for the screenshot enthusiasts out there the most recent update has added a photo mode which is quite fun in and of itself with the options available to tweak shots check out The_Community hub for some great examples of the shots being produced from within the gameit seems like the gaming industry has turned a corner with respect to licensed products the batman series is exceptional and from what i understand there ' s even an alien game that ' s actually very good and now at long last we ' ve got the one lord of the rings game to rule them all"

Team_Fortress_2,"Team_Fortress_2 is a teambased firstperson shooter multiplayer computer game developed by valve it is the successful sequel to tream fortress classic it first came out in a compilation called the orange box which is no longer avaliable as of 2011 Team_Fortress_2 is a free to play game where you can upgrade to premium via purchasing something from the Team_Fortress_2 ingame storegameplay this fun game is based on two oppisite teams builders league united often refered to as blu team and red team reliable excavation and demolition players can choose to play as one of the nine character classes in these teams each with their own unique strenghts weaknesses and weapons each class consist of a primary weapon a secondary weapon and a melee weapon although certain classes contain pdas and other unique items Team_Fortress_2 was released with six offical maps but many more maps have been added a neat little addition to this game is the administrator a woman announces different game events over pa or loudspeaker so that everyone in the game can hear it stats are a extreamly nice addition to this game where time played as a certain class most kills as that class and most objectives achived in that life etcgame modesin capture the flag maps the objective for both teams is to obtain a briefcase of intelligence from the enemy teams base and return it to their own base while preventing the opposing team from doing the same the player carrying the intelligence can be killed to drop the briefcase or the player can willingly drop it in either case this starts a brief timer a team can only score by delivering the enemys intelligence to their base a match lasts until one team scores a set number of points or time runs out a variant of capture the flag called special delivery has teams vying over a single briefcase to attempt to deliver to a common target once the intelligence is picked up by one team only members of that team can carry it until either it successfully delivered or the drop timer expires and it is returned to its original spawn point control point modes are more varied in their objectives but share the common aim of capturing a particular point on the map by having one or more team members stay on the point without the presence of the opposing team for a short period of time in standard control point maps each team already controls an equal number of points with one additional point left unclaimed teams can only attempt to capture points that are nearest to those points they already control each team attempts to progressively capture all the control points to win the round in attackdefendstyle maps the red team already controls all the points on the map and must hold these points from being captured by the opposing team blu team for a length of time attackdefendstyle maps can come in either singleround or multipleround maps rounds past the first will only be played if blu wins a roundterritorial control is a more complex version of control point in which each map is divided into a number of closed sections held between the two teams each round has one team attempting to seize control of the opposing teams capture point for that section in a fixed amount of time once a team holds all but the enemys home base point they then attempt to capture the enemy base point while the enemy defends for a fixed amount of timeking of the hill features a single control point in the center of the map with teams vying for control over it the control point is locked for a set amount of time after the round start once the point is unlocked either team can capture it capturing the control point starts the teams clock counting down the clock that is currently counting down will only stop if the other team captures the point the clock reaches 00 or another mapspecific event occurs such as a halloween boss spawning during the halloween event teams win the round when their clock reaches 00 with the control point currently under their control if the other team is capturing the point the round will not end until the points capture progress resets to 0payload maps feature a length of track atop which sits a bomb mounted on a cart these maps come in two varieties in normal payload maps one team must escort the cart through a series of checkpoints in a limited amount of time to reach a final target that the other team defends the cart moves when one or more players of the team are near it without enemies nearby during this the cart heals and provides ammo to those close by if no one is by the cart it may move backwards towards the last checkpoint or roll off uphill sections of the track in payload races both teams race to deliver a bombcart to a final target there are no checkpoints and unmanned carts will not move in reverse but still require team members nearby to fully complete uphill sections both types of payload maps can come in singleround or multipleround maps in standard payload further rounds will only be played if blu wins in payload race all rounds will be played regardless of which team wins but the winner of previous rounds starts with their cart farther up the trackarena is a team deathmatch mode typically occurring smaller environments featuring a single control point in each round players do not respawn on death a team wins the round by capturing the control point or eliminating all of the other team membersmedieval mode can be played on maps dedicated to this mode or enabled for any other mode type this mode forces players to use melee or similar medieval weaponsmvm mann vs machine is a six player cooperative mode where the mercenaries are defending a structure against increasingly difficult waves of robots players have the ability to buy

Terraria,"if u like hardcore minecraft this is the game for you much more immersive then minecraft in minecraft there is no exploration purposes but in Terraria u can find special statues gems like diamonds rubys ect far more ores and minerals and its actually graduately harder then minecraft the game can either like you or hate u with a wide veriety of monsters and bosses more then minecraft that has only 2 the point here is that even if u like minecraft this game can make it worth your while"
Terraria,"unturned is a really fun game and sometimes even show really i mean really funny moments i recommend trying it unlike Terraria and left for dead 2 it is more like a sandbox game because you can get really creative and build things like Terraria but also go ahead have fun by killing some zombies to be honest unturned is still a early development game which makes is more intresting because we will never know what will happen in the future and what it will be like when fully complete the even better things about this game is that is 2 perspective first person and third person recently unturned just added vrvirtural reality which makes it more fun to get in the experience of what a zombie apoclypse fells like and how you can survive in iti strongly recommend this game but i do have a few tips maybe like add a main power place and add more weapons to make the game a bit more relastic such as a ak47 but the main things i suggest you need to figure out is a story line of how the zombie apoclypse started because the new players wont know how it happend and just get spawned right into the game"

Tf2,"arent you glad team fortress 2 didnt wind up looking like this valve has created quite a game with the longawaited team fortress sequel bearing many similarities to its predecessor though incorporating enough changes to make it feel fresh the most obvious aspect which you may have noticed from any of the screens and video posted is the visual style even after getting sucked into probably too many hours of play in the beta over the past few weeks were still amazed at the art design both in how it looks and how it animates but lets not get too carried away with the graphics its a game after all and the most important factor is how it plays and if its entertaining its interesting to see both team fortress 2 which has been in development on and off for some seven years now and splash damages enemy territory quake wars which has seen its own share of setbacks and delays finally come out right around the same time their nearly simultaneous retail release presents and interesting situation for you the consumer as to how to spend your cash you may fondly remember your days in return to castle wolfenstein enemy territory dropping air strikes on hapless attackers and eagerly charging into bunkers to spout forth deadly plumes of flamethrower fuel yet you cant forget your days with team fortress classic or even further back with the original team fortress quake mod with its now painfully dated character models but compelling teamfocused online play theres really no right answer in this case as to which game is ultimately better its merely personal preference quake wars is assuredly the more complicated game for those uninitiated in the ways of enemy territory the scope dynamic objectives speed at which the tide of battle can turn and the number of things you need to quickly consider when that happens and user interface can be rather daunting after learning the ins and outs its clearly an excellent product but it lacks that immediate irresistible appeal so prominent in valves team fortress 2 and accessibility may very well be the deciding factor in determining which product users prefer regardless its an excellent time to be a gamer since as tough as it may be to pick one or the other making either choice rewards you with a well designed and highly entertaining title like in team fortress classic tfc team fortress 2 has nine character classes spy pyro soldier heavy medic sniper demoman scout and engineer each class abilities on the battlefield have been streamlined which along with the graphics is what makes team fortress 2 so much more accessible than tfc no longer do you have engineers running around with railguns and emp grenades medics cant infect the other team spies dont have tranquilizer darts and none of the classes have hand grenades in Tf2 each class has roughly three main ways of attacking a primary weapon the heavys minigun pyros flamethrower engineers sentry gun etc and secondary various classes have shotguns others pistols while the demoman has a highly effective mine thrower and melee weapons the scouts bat the medics bonesaw and so on though classes now possess fewer means of attacking the resulting gameplay feels much more focused each class has a very clearly defined role and the means to ensure they perform successfully the only limiting factor is of course how effectively your team meshes together if your engineers arent guarding their structures spies can wipe them out in seconds with a few sapper charges if your team is full of heavies and soldiers but lacks medics youre not going to get very far if youre playing a capture point map without any scouts on your team you might as well just leave the server or start berating your squadmates until a few switch classes the medic though seems to be the hinge on which all gameplay balance swivels for Tf2 theyve been given a health hose which blasts out a restorative stream at friendlies within range and sticks to them as long as you keep the fire button depressed as you heal injured teammates or overheal to 150 percent health an ubercharge meter builds in the bottom right of the screen unleashing this renders both target and medic invulnerable for a few seconds which is sometimes the only way to break through chokepoints populated with heavies medics and multiple tier three sentry guns even though medics may be the most vital to a teams success the other classes remain useful scouts who are now rather deadly are far and away the fastest and their ability to doublejump and change direction in midair makes then all the more difficult to hit spies in addition to being able to onehit kill backstab the enemy cause general chaos among enemy ranks if your opponents know a spy is running around theyll waste time and lose focus by shooting at their own teammates to try and reveal a disguised culprit pyros tend to be the most effective spy detectors and can be frequently seen doing fiery pirouettes in 2fort matches all over the beta servers as a spy incognito will betray his cover by bursting into flames upon contact with the burning sprayin a september 26 steam update friendly fire was removed from Tf2 which was definitely a good move friendly fire ruins much of the game considering the closequarters maps combined with the wide area of effect attacks of heavies pyros demomen and soldiers without ff teammates

Tf2,"strictly speaking Tf2 the usual multiplayer thriller division on the role that is different from competitors only at the expense of humor of course if shooting at the men in funny red and blue costumes everything you do not have enough to be happy and do not need more"
Terraria,"an old man awaits at the entrance of a dungeon stricken by a mysterious curse he urges you to return after the sun has set to free him of the madness that has infected his body so you spend the day amid the grassy splendor of Terraria surveying caves slaying rabbits and slimes as the hours tick by once night has set you return to the old man to free him of his curse and reap whatever rewards he wishes to give you it turns out that the little curse transformed the old man into a demonic skeleton a hovering monstrosity that unleashes holy hell upon your poorly equipped explorer the battle rages for 10 seconds maybe 20 if you run away at the onset and then youre left staring at your corpse and wondering how you could ever defeat such a beastbut theres no reason to be deterred by such a thorough beating Terraria uses an empowering sense of discovery to grab you and that unrestrained freedom is a doubleedged sword free to explore the untouched lands you may happen upon a monster much more powerful than you or you may find a chest filled with precious treasures youre never sure where your travels will lead you but your curiosity is always rewarded you may gain knowledge such as knowing not to talk to old men at night or happen upon a cache of gold which can be used to forge a powerful sword its a world bursting with possibilities Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that awaitan apartment complex reaching toward the sky gives your helpers plenty of room for themselvesTerraria debuted on the pc almost two years ago and i was worried how such a mouseheavy game could make the transition to a traditional control scheme after a little practice my worries were thankfully banished movement works remarkably well on the vita which makes sense given that Terraria feels like a 2d platformer performing precise jumps and grappling up walls feel even better using an analog stick instead of keyboard keys so theres joy in traversing the world that didnt exist before however movement isnt nearly as important as excavation and thats where patience matters no longer can you dig precisely with a mouse instead you use a stick the game has two options manual and smart which have different strengths and weaknesses if youre clearing a deep hole smart is blunt and effective if you need to focus on individual blocks manual works fine unfortunately your cursor is controlled by both the right stick and the back touchpad and theres no way to disable the second scheme so you do have to hold the vita carefully lest you dig haphazardlyTerraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that awaitdiscovery is the essence of Terraria but thankfully that doesnt extend to basic play concepts the pc version struggled to communicate exactly what you were supposed to do in this expansive world and though the vita version doesnt spell out every detail it does a great job of pushing you in the right direction shelter is the most pressing matter for a lone explorer chop down trees to gain wood and then use that wood to build a house once you lay out the frame you need doors and a chair to complete the requirements and thats where you get your first hint at what makes Terraria so appealing youre told to make a crafting table and by standing near it you can make the rest of the pieces to finish your house and there are a lot more items you can craft beyond that with a bevy of weapons and armor clothes and decorations there are tons of tools you can make that help you become a better explorera little snow never hurt anyonethe items you can craft are clearly spelled out for you so youre never unclear about whats possible once you acquire any of the plentiful materials strewn about the land you learn how you can use them to craft something that could help you on the journey turn cobwebs into silk and then combine that with wood to make a bed melt silver nuggets into bars and then pound those into a shining suit at your anvil by seeing exactly what items you can create youre pushed to gather those materials as quickly as you can you want that jungle hat right well you better find an underground jungle and gather spores if you want to sport that fine protective gear an enticing cycle of hunting for materials followed by reaping a reward crops up in the early moments once you have golden armor and tools you can venture further which allows you to access even more powerful weaponsmuch of your time in Terraria is spent digging elaborate tunnels beneath the surface its there that the most precious resources are buried so you grab some torches and try to fend off the skeletons and bats as you dig ever deeper down its a slow process that stays compelling for two important reasons first with so many secrets hidden below you continually stumble upon exciting new areas maybe you land at a place filled with bioluminescent mushrooms that can be brewed into a handy potion or find a makeshift house hiding a treasure chest you never know so you keep digging second theres a puzzle element to digging successfully when you chip away at rock in the deep end of a lake you have to figure out how to manage your dwindling supply of oxygen while going further down or you may have to divert water toward smoldering lava to create obsidian youre always planning the best possible route while fending off enemies which keeps you engaged during those solitary hours carving out earthit would be so much easier to mine this meteor if aliens werent flying at your headonce you harvest enough gold to drape yourself in it you may wonder where youre supposed to go next well thankfully theres a guide who can point you in the right direction building houses attracts nonplayer characters and each has his or her own way to help you the guide tells you that its finally time to fight a boss and even details how to summon it which is a godsend if youre lost if you have an explosive in your inventory a blasthappy dude moves in who happily sells you dynamite and bombs theres no way to know exactly what will lure more npcs to your commune so just experiment with everything possible none of them are necessary to complete your adventure but they are a handy resource when youre stumped just make sure you fortify your walls you wouldnt want a goblin army killing your only friendscombat in Terraria is often simple killing slimes is more about positioning than deeper tactics so most enemies serve as a distraction rather than a serious roadblock of course you could play with permadeath if you want a real challenge or lose all of your items upon every death but such consequences were so severe for me that i didnt want to venture forth which defeats the point of the game the normal option is that you lose money when you die which is a gentle scolding more than a serious setbackdigging a helevator is the quickest way to reach the bottom of the worldbe prepared to die a lot when bosses make an appearance every battle is against a massive beast that dwarfs your feeble adventurer so you have to be smart and well prepared if youre going to come out on top if you collect enough shooting stars beforehand you can craft mana crystals that let you use magic its much safer to shoot magical strikes from a distance than to get up close with your warhammer still there are many different tactics to take out the various bosses and who knows maybe you wont have a chance to plan out a strategy at all the eye of cthulhu randomly appears once youve become powerful enough and its crazy to fight this flying beast while in a subterranean jungle always be prepared for a fight you wouldnt want to lose your hardearned money because you forgot your bow"

Csgo,"death is a great teacher failure in counterstrike global offensive is as it always has been for this series the greatest way to learn where you should have gone what you shouldnt have done and how you could have done better counterstrike players spend a lot of time learning consequently they are always getting bettergrowth is an important factor in global offensive especially if youre coming into counterstrike fresh or after a sabbatical this is an extremely hardcore skillbased firstperson shooter and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters if you ' re a call of duty player you ' re going to need to change your play style to succeed here counterstrike also tries developing into something new here as well despite doing little to push itself beyond what it ' s always done best global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 yearsfor the uninitiated counterstrike global offensive is a smallscale teambased firstperson shooter with permanent death when a counterterrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic defusal match or a ct escort swallows a sniper round in hostage rescue the victim is dead for good and doesnt respawn until the next round as such players on both sides must exercise skill and care the bomb objective meanwhile gives everyone a purpose of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the cts the slip plant their bomb and protect the bomb site between rounds everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns and the cycle continuespieces of the counterstrike formula are dated at this point but the superb heart and soul of global offensive is timeless teams are small guns are lethal and rounds are short theres an addictive justonemoreround quality to it because theres a constant desire to do better than last time to earn a satisfying kill or to win in a new way call of duty and battlefield vets will wonder why they cant sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim counterstrike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard but the changes are for the best the underpass choke point in dedust for instance has a new escape routeeven in the face of genre evolution global offensive doesn ' t care to adapt Csgo is so dedicated to counterstrikes aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it bruteforces its way to success part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in global offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters everyone is limited to what they have and can see with little room for character modification or onthefly advantages running and gunning is a useless play style even if youve bought a helmet and kevlar that round to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill walking crouching or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machinegun fireconsequently killing in global offensive feels good theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back its also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim if players arent watching corners providing covering fire or using smoke grenades and flashbangs theyre more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman the desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing even when youre getting steamrolled by an obviously better teamif youve played counterstrike before global offensive probably sounds a whole lot like counterstrike like counterstrike source before it global offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter while doing little to disrupt the core form and function at the same time it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effortfire is one of the most interesting new combat variables molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic too theyre particularly useful during demolition matches which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between the new and modified maps in this mode arent as big as classic counterstrike arenas - entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location - but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever the lake map is a standout theres a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots to separate demolition from defusal players cant buy between rounds instead it takes a cue from the other new mode arms race in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly the better you do the more you have to switch up the way you play and because demolition is so fast youll need to be quick on your feet"
Portal,"Portal 2 is a great game created by valve you are basically a guinea pig test subject who is a girl named chell and in the previous game Portal the machine that created these puzzels and tricked you and tried to kill you is named glados you eventually kill her well in Portal 2 you are still playing as the original character chell and was in a room where you would be picked for later testing but a robot came alon named wheatley who comes along and helps you out and you come across glados turned but of course wheatley does something stupid and you have to fight her again going through 19 puzzles and when you defeat her wheatley is now in charge and gladoss intelligence is now in a potatoe which you carry around with you because wheatley through you two down a hole and as you travel through the underground you come across the first testing chambers and find a story that you will have to find out for yourself but in these testing chambers your using gel the blue allows you to jump higher the orange to move faster and the white allows you to create Portals where it has touched oh and when you get to chapter 6 you will find a achievement realating to half life borialis and at the end you send wheatley into space and your sent out into a wheat field i recomend this game to everyone now youre thinking with Portals"
