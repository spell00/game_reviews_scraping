Terraria,"i ve always liked games like Terraria with the 2 dimensional survival and exploration aspect and starbound does all these well and more lets start with its soundtrack to sum it up in one paragraph would do it injustice this games soundtrack is fully orchestral and imersive the music just fits perfectly where ever you are in game whether you are spelunking or just flying through the vast expanse of space it fits perfectly and leaves you in awe ok onto the graphics the look and feel of this game bring the vast worlds to life with the many colors and alien dirts trees and the mixture of monsters the backgrounds of the planets match up the the foregrounds well and give the 2d aspect that 3d feel now the gameplay starbound has a nice rich layer of gameplay revolving around survival in the latest unstable build updates they have introduced a very needed layer of missions and npc quests which fullfil the gaps of just flying from planet to planet and give purpose starbounds worlds have a wide variety of random aspects to them first off the flora flora of planets consists of 2 3 main aspects the trees the small bushes and medium bushes each planet has a vast difference to the next in their flora with trees coming in 2 3 different types from metallic trees to plain out alien tentacles now onto the fauna each planet has 3 or more ground based animals which increase in strength further beneath the planets surface starbound has a feature where animals are customized via their limbs and body there are many arms legs feet and bodies all just jumbled to together from monster to monster making cute monsters and just plain out terrifying ones there are also around 2 bird species per planet using the same general system i personally suggest this game because of its deep and fluid experience and its wide modding community 8 9 10 for an early access and its only going to get better"

Tf2,"this game has an excellent style of fighting with high amounts of diferent weapons to use from with the help of the hl2 engine the graphics models of weapons and characters this deserves one of the best shooters game of all time as well as this map making is avaliable to all people who are willing to do it same with plugins for custom servers source film maker and many more things this is overall a stunning game that i have played for a while and deserves a yes gg valve some things that may put it down however would be the fact that some recent updates are very similar in terms of style for example the gun mettle update brought in contracts new maps etc the halloween update brought in the same thing but just different missions people who play other shooter games that are like cod battlefield etc one thing i would have to say to those people would be don t shout at the medic to run to you and specifically you because apparantely you are the one carrying the team with your gibus and goggles and your natascha family business and your eviction notice pub doesnt work like that sunshine as well as this don t be an heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit to the new kid or some heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit just because you got screwed over when you were new at some point this new kid will have a better inventory yes i know just because having an expensive inventory doesnt make you a better player better items and a better fighting style Tf2 doesnt need those kinds of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit on their servers either way although there are some parts of the years to come that will be lazy there will be better things introduced frankly i want some new weapons they ve been just introducing reskins example batsaber yes"
Tf2,"well for starters when i write reviews they are usually just for the RIRE this is not the case this game is genuinely a masterpiece and i have never played a game that made me feel so many emotions that range all over the spectrum i mean hell i thought the last of us was emotional as hell one minute its happy then desparation then wanting to cry like a baby points in the game specifically made me question my manhood due to how much i was trying to not break down like a baby this game honestly does show alot of great points that are true in real life as well like value those close to you and despite this being the internet and it not being known to be shown but showing compassion and taking the time to give a helping hand could possibly save someones life it is funny that a troll on Tf2 would find such a great love and change of perspective from a game call me names call me what ever the hell you like i never thought i would go deep about a game but simply put this game while it may not be for everyone is a really great game and i honestly say it is worth more that just 20 dollars 100 10"
Tf2,"i spent way too much time on this game early on in highschool may or may not have led to me dropping math as a subject besides that this game doesn t feel the same as it did 5 years ago in my personal opinion the new content scheme they ve borrowed from one of their other games cs go shows a stark indication of how much damage the newer updates have wreaked on the Tf2 community the new guns skins look awful it s a transplant from cs gone wrong it s a lot more toxic and competitive in Tf2 now f2p destroyed the quality of an already degrading player base idle and achievement servers fill up the server list completely Tf2 we had a good run but now it s time for this grizzled mercenary to hang up his hats"
Tf2,"it was well made and worth buying if you get left 4 dead 1 and 2 you will get 2 hats on Tf2"
Tf2,"3 years i ve played this game and although that doesn t seem as much as a lot of people due to the fact that this game is one of the oldest on steam people questioned me why i played it and some even made fun of me for it the Tf2 community might be at the lowest yet with the new tough break update but still even if the biggest people in Tf2 such as jerma985 and star are sick of it i am not it just shows how much this game has dragged me back to it even if i rejected to eventually i would return and play because i know i want to most my friends that i played Tf2 with i barely even see play it but i don t care this game is one of the most special games i ve ever played and it was one of the very first games that i ve actually stuck around on others i got bored of after getting sick and tired of their repetitive style but still for some reason this game is the only one where i won t stop even if i want to i ll get to the point of it now i absolutely love and i mean love this game no matter what people tell me about how it isn t as competetive as cs go or it is stupid because of how they re always hats on people s heads this game is different from your normal fps games you actually have to work as a team well to win the game not just run around and shoot people its classes are all balanced and don t handle like cod battlefield or cs go which shows how different it is so why not give it a try if i and many can enjoy it shows no reason why you can t go download Tf2 now and i mean now mr"
Portal,"really good game for starters of Portal and loads of fun"
Tf2,"play Tf2 or i ll come for u when ur sleeping RIRE"
Terraria,"at first i thought that this game would have just been another plain old Terraria type game but when i started getting the hang of it it just clicked for me i instantly loved the game with all the beautiful types of planets there are species items and so much more this game is definitly deserving an instant buy even in its early build but i know for sure that as this game progresses with newer builds and versions i know for sure that it will be well worth money spent dif you have spent your time to read this review then thank you and i truly recommend that you buy this game cause its soo addictive and exciting d"
The_Community,"this game is highly thought out the way The_Community is always workshopping new ideas for the game the thrill of owning an unusualor australium and cosmetics is amazing the team is nice admins and server players are always good to meet personal rating 9 10 great game"
The_Community,"great game you can tell just by the number of people reviewing this game negatively with over 100h or 400h played sure there are a few bugs but the devs are working hard on fixing stuff communicate with The_Community and release patches with a lot of new content every other month this is a game based on grinding and sometime it will take time to get your gears just the way you want it but the dz is a great experience with some balancing issues that will shift the meta of the game strongly towards a build here and there haven t seen a hacker in 2 months playing the dz fairly often rank 82 people saying the game is full of hackers are the same guys that get rekt in cs and call hacks on everyone i strongly recommend this game for both the pve and the pvp aspect"
Team_Fortress_2,"this is an awesome game may overtake Team_Fortress_2 this game is an awesome shooter you play as different classes and like blacklight retribution you need to spend time farming coins to unlock characters for ever or you can wait for monthly trial rotations of the characters is great to play with friends and solo"
Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"this is a great game an fps tactical game that is more aim and team work than cod run around and spray and pray hoping to god that the server lag is in your favor overall Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive is a great map with a good community base exammple the over watch although the people you play with may be toxic or the best funniest people to play with warning if you play this game and you seek short periods of fun then casual and deathmatch are the way to go that and arms race don t play competitive match making if you don t have atleast 45 minutes to 1 hours worth of time for one game thats right you need a lot of time to play competitive match making let alone get good at the game that way otherwise i would recommend this game as it is enjoyable and not too over the top"
Tf2,"well valve u screwed up pyros are too overpowered and now the new update u destroyed the rocke tjumper and there is no normal valve servers now i ve been playing this game since 2013 and i miss the old times now i got to wait 1 hour just to find a casual server the pyro is just too overpowed and can kill a soldier and scout easily just by holding down w and holding down mouse one and now its hard just to have fun in Tf2"

Dota_2,"i don t know what all the negative reviewers are blabbing about i think this game is really unique as a player of hon only a few days dota maybe only a few months RIRE quite some time i think strife is as easy as RIRE not easier there s also a lot of things in common with Dota_2 and RIRE they introduce the same things with a combination of different methods baron roshan cindara but strife adds odd things like out of combat regeneration which i actually think is perfectly fine all the actual problems lie in normal regeneration this game has a lot of potential if balanced right the meta is a bit undeveloped due to how supports can do around as much damage as the nukers and mages can build enough tank items to work like one but it is unique in the fact that top and middle are duo lanes while bottom is usually soloed the biggest complaint i have however is ray strife s teemo"
Portal,"Portal in general is the best puzzle game i ve ever expirenced this game itself however is exetremely fun and intresting and can easily get players hooked on it"
Terraria,"combines aspects from other games in a way that makes the game truly unique in its own way one of the only if any mmo s that allows you to dig on the Terrarian itself although you can t build on the terrain unless it s in your own cornerstone which is basically your own portable headquarters that you craft things at for an mmo this game took an interesting style of graphics that i haven t seen done before in an mmo a bunch of classes to chose from all seeming quite different from one another the game is free can be a good mmo for someone who s never played one you can deassemble a weapon or accessory you don t want to turn it into crafting materials that you may find more useful stating this many reviews on here say that the problem with the game is that it takes so long to connect to servers but this has been fixed to my understanding although there is a huge arsenal of weapons that you are pre assigned based on your class e g shadow archers will only receive bows none of them actually change the way you fight or for that matter give you any feeling of variety you progress so quickly that an item you picked up that you may have considered to be really good at the time can quickly become outdated in terms of stats the game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don t actually feel accomplished no storyline none this game is repetitive most of your objectives in this game are basically kill this and receive this or mine this and receive this due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking why am i even doing this no actual quests you have a pre determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing you have no freedom to do what you want that is if you want to actually make progress within the game you must complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one the entire game is randomly generated making there feel like there s nothing to actually explore it s just randomly generated terrain and dungeons that also seem to be very repetitive you must make an account for the game itself this isn t so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work both me and my friend had the problem character customization itself is bad not the hats there s plenty of those there aren t many color options as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color e g you can not change your height width etc things in the tutorial seem to be out of order for example around my first hour of gameplay i was being being told the buttons used to attack even though i had already killed loads of enemies does not have very much music all drops are marked as uncommon rare when it comes to the rarity tag of an item i ve never seen a single item marked as common i feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplished this game has had a lot of potential it really did sadly i have to say that i must give this game a 4 10 for the reasons listed above"
The_Community,"alright so this game is amazing alot of people say it copied ark but you re wrong anyways to a review the game is awesome so many things to do great with friends everything you really need there is a downside though that really hurts The_Community in australiano aus servers they may be coming soon but at the moment i go on it regularly just to see if its had an update for aus servers i would still recommend picking it up if its on sale atleast 25 and play with friends on a local hosted server i give it a thumbs up but if you re in australia don t bother unless you are a singeplayer person stand high ping or if its atleast 50 off hope this helped"

Nether,"great experience best part is the player vs player interactions they really balanced out the game so that its not a mindless slaughter looking at you Nether but is still a pvp game the player interactions were good fun when they are not screaming friendly at the top of their lungs while running away but the amount of bugs is almost unforgiveable currently i have one where every 5 minutes i get 1 5 fps and can barely move buildings get low texture quality and when inside one i can not see the walls nor floor once they fix the bugs truly a worthwhile experience"

Nuclear_Throne,"enter the gungeon is a roguelike top down shooter similar to games like the binding of isaac or Nuclear_Throne each level floor is randomly generated with all sorts of special rooms combat rooms secret areas and of course the boss you will need to defeat to progress to the next floor the game is perma death meaning when you die your run is over for good adding a bunch of challenge to the game gungeon has a dodge roll mechanic that is used to avoid bullets and consumable blanks that destroy all bullets on the screen these make the game a bit easier there are many many different guns buffs and active and passive abilites allowing for heaps of potential synergies the game is also chock full of cheesy gun related puns and references to other games tv shows etc overall this enter the gungeon is really fun but it can be hard and frustrating at times"

Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"chivalry is a great game and theres not much games like this around i mean steam is over saturated with generic shooters that are not really unqiue in there own right but chivalry studies the likes of the medievil times and the medievil times hasn t really been done in video games all that much i mean you couldn t really count the elder scrolls games as medievil because there not there fantasy but back to chivalry chivalry has some awesome gore splattering gameplay some pretty good graphics and chivalry is just all around fun if i could name some cons about chivalry it would be that in my opinon the price point is asking for a bit too much i mean you ve got games like Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive and garry s mod that s only 15 bucks and packs like a mind boglging amount of content but chivalry also has a bit of learning curve which is not a bad thing but it s just something to consider chivalry is an amazing game it s not perfect but it s a game you should definetly consider letting into your steam libary if you can find chivalry on sale on steam definetly pick it up if you can you will not regret it seriously you won t it scores a 9 10 dismembered heads"

Tf2,"ok i just have to say this i have once liked Tf2 but after some time of playing this game i have slowly started to hate this game so much reasons why you might want to ask me is that i have not really liked the admins of certain cervers mainly the two pony cervers im on and some others as well with getting new ones and getting rid of once good ones who i have actually liked this game is also used for the shop which is used for the keys to unlock these crates that are usually what you might get over a nice weapon or a rare chance of a simple hat but honestly do people really want to spend over 30 or maybe 60 but not even exactly 100 dollars on some stupid heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ring that no one will ever buy for unless they really wanted to spend it on that damn thing i say no you can get anything you wanted thats not some cosmetic item for your classes to all wear but i say that these items that i have seen and the new things that have even appeared in this game are just useless all you get are some weapons or the main thing of hats which i have seen over the time that i have played this damn game but unlike other games i have seen or played such as cs go also do the same thing with the shopping mechanism of the keys and crates for weapons but as for Tf2 i would say that i wouldn t even dare to touch or play this game even if they have made some good buffs but after that gunn metel update it just made it all go away for me and started to not even play it one single bit now if anyone would give me a single reason as to why i should play this game and i mean a good one not that its so fun and amazing and that you can play with friend just like any other game i have and that one of my friends have to play on i want a really good reason that you can easily persuade me to start this game up again once more and to prove that it will be worth my while then i will be playing it but otherwise i am not playing it worth anything even if i were to get an unusual which would cost me something or if anyone gave it to me for free it s not happening and it is final"

Evolve,"banished reviewsteam release date 19 feb 2014genre city builder strategy survivaldev name and status shining rock software indieage rating n aworth it yes tl drbanished is a challenging but fantastic city builder which strays from the rest as it is not your typical city builder instead of huge capital cities that we see in games like cities skylines banished focuses on a small town with a low budget personally i think it is one of the best games in the city building genre that said however the ai of the villagers is rather mediocre and at the moment there isn t a whole lot to it s beautiful bones this game can provide hours of good challenging fun but don t come expecting anything like cities skylines also note that this game is very hard and may be frustrating to those new to the genre even experienced city builders will also need to have a few tries to get used to it s somewhat complicated mechanics and challenge banished has a bit of a lack of tutorials so don t expect that you will understand everything right away banished is fantastic and challenging but don t come expecting another cities skylines after many tries and hours of understanding every little mechanic i have finally formed a functional city with a good population yet in this game someething small or big will fail and everything will completely go down hill that is the thing with shining rock software s 2014 city builder banished there is and always will be an underlying threat whether it s famine cold a natural disaster your town will eventually go to the pigs your town starts off with a few small hopeful families a storage barn and a stock pile with not a hell of a lot of starting resources you start off building a few small wooden houses you make some gatherer s huts forester lodges nothing too big your town will slowly grow in population and size and soon you have a city on your hands however don t expect it to be a cities skylines type thing where you can just sit back and watch your city work you need to keep your eyes on the game at all times one time i had a town wide famine because the road from one of the gatherer s huts to the storage barn was too long couldn t understand why everyone kept dying of starvation while it is occasionally very frustrating it is a very addictive game and sometimes when everything goes bad the game really shines the dire need of resources the feeling of hope the game will immerse you so lets get into the pros and the cons pros addictive challenging a blast of fresh air cool art style and general feel interesting seeing your town work and grow from the teamwork of all your villagers immersive lots to achieve and work to relatively simple pretty good map generation settings weather cycles which can mean life or death lots of different ways to approach things you could use a gatherer to gather food from the forest use aquired seeds to make farms or maybe just buy all your resources off the trading post you can decide villagers aren t just lifeless robots they have needs and happiness which can be fulfilled in different ways natural disasters are a cool feature which you need to prepare for gives you a good overview of statistics in your towncons villager ai is mediocre at best not great control over a few different things like villager paths and resource management not a hell of a lot on it s bones yet lack of tutorials just throws you in the deep end ui can be a little hard to navigate some resources like rocks are not unlimited and will eventually run out this takes a long time though annoying little bugs which can destroy your citywell that s basically that banished has a fair share of cons just like any game but i personally think it deserves a solid 8 5 10it serves as a fantastic ant farm simulator as well seeing your people Evolve and grow seeing them get all wiped out fun it is one of my favourites in the city builder genre and any experienced city builder should pick up this game but even newbies to the the genre can pick up this game and have fun"
Evolve,"surprisingly it s a really rather good city builder disclaimer long and detailed review skip to bottom for final verdicti got tropico 4 in a humble bundle kind ve only wanting the other games in the bundle so there it sat in my vast steam library not really doing anything and then my friend told me about a really good city builder that he had been playing i thought oh simcity right wrong he was talking about tropico tropico 5 however at this time i had forgotten that i even had it so when i looked it up on the steam store i realised that i already had it so i gave it a shot and i was quite presently surprised so here is a list explaining the good and bad elements of tropico 4 and there reasons pros each little person has their own profile what was one of the elements that made tropico stand out was the ability to click on every little person walking around doing there daily routine once you clicked on them a profile of the character came up explaining their age wellbeing faction name where they work and where they live it would also make the camera follow that person sometimes i would find myself just seeing people go about their daily lives for hours on end in the population there are structured families a little more of a unnecessary part of the game but undoubtedly cool was the structured families sometimes when checking people s profiles you may find a group of people with the same last name at first i thought ths was just due to the developers not putting enough names in but then i executed a guy and then everybody with the same last name as him got enraged confused i looked at the effects of executing someone and it said victim s family will become enraged and thats when i realised there was families which is really cool a system where technology Evolves with time much like civilization v which is an utterly fantastic strategy game technology would advance as time goes on this means that i might start out with some crappy tenements but when i research more stuff i could have super high tec shopping malls nuff said the ability of extreme power in this game you have the power of anything and everything on the island apart from the rebels which we will get to later none of the decisions will be made for you you have to make them there are recomendations for what to build but i mostly found myself ignoring them as sometimes they can screw you over rebels the rebels system in this game is rather good it s simple when someone becomes too unhappy with the island they will become a rebel rebels can and will screw you over they will start fires attack buildings and people and generally become out of control disasters perhaps copying other citybuilders this game has disasters dont worry though you won t be having meteors or aliens or dinosaurs cough simcity cough just normal things like nuclear bombs or volcano eruptions or earthquakes and it won t just be mildly annoying either it will seriously screw you over once when i built my city next to a volcano thinking it would look pretty cool lets just say it wasn t cool when flying blobs of lava engulfed the city and i went financialy in debt so thats the list of things which i think are pretty cool in this game now we will talk about the cons cons limited time the thing i can think of straight off the bat is that it has a limited amount of time for a game even in sandbox mode sure it is a while but one time i built a really great city and then i couldn t play anymore because my mandate had run out and that was on maximum time sure it adds realism but sometimes fun should overweigh how realistic it is this is where just cause 2 shined now you might be thinking what the devil what on earth has that got ot do with tropico well my friend nothing i was just bringing it up anyways the reason just cause 2 was so fun is that it was completely unrealistic tropico should get some inspiration off that lack of help one of the annoying things about this game is that it just throws you in with build a city this is a large downside as the game is quite complicated in the financial part of things alot of the time i found myself looking at my amount of money going down by the thousands completely confused why graphics now i would like to point out that this is a very small and minor problem especially considering it s a citybuilder but the graphics are a little lacking final verdictso we are down to the final verdict and if you couldn t already tell with the big blue thumbs up stamped on i most certainly recomend tropico 4 even though it has flaws i can still say this is a great solid citybuilder thank you for taking some time to read this"
Tf2,"Tf2 is a great game to play with your friends and is free there are all different classes and there is even a mode where you fight robots so i suggest you get this game"
Awesomenaughts,"Awesomenaughts is a fantastic game one of the funnest iv ever played i sugest you buy it straight away"
The_Community,"dark souls iian atmospheric adventure allowing you to have different 3 endings in total as the dark souls franchise has always been punishing if you were to do something incredibly stupid but despite on how much i liked the previous installments i do not like this one the main reason is the poise system accordingly bandai namco from software have said it is working as intended and yet the description of said feature is not how it works in dark souls i poise was a big part of game play for casters and heavy builds in dark souls ii poise was altered to a good degree to make some of the pvp a little more bearable for when a dex build vs strength in dark souls ii however it is a completely useless feature that has split The_Community into 2 fragments people who think poise was an op feature for heavy builds and then the people who thinks it s complete bs heavy armor s main advantage was poise allowing you to withstand hits without flinching or slightly so untill you re staggered clerics sorcerers pyromancers and warriors alike were all hindered by this change to the 3rd installment to this degree you might as well as start off deprived and play through the entire game as is or atleast use the master s attire because armor reduction does jack all i m am gravely disappointed in bandai namco and from software"
The_Community,"gunslingers itself is fun i enjoyed it when the matchmaking system actually gave us even geared teammates and opponents which may explain why we only won two matches but the micro transactions are too prevalent to ignore would i recommend this game to my friends currently maybe depending on whether they can deal with the micro transactions would i recommend this game if the micro transactions were removed or even balanced absolutely hopefully with this game being in early access they will respond to The_Community ' s gripes with them and remove them because this game has potential to be good real good check out the full review at http imagengames com gunslingers mercs for sale"
Portal,"love what they are doing with this game the movements are slow enough that you don t get motion sickness but still get to pilot the time machine like a sub the graphics are pretty and feel realistic a controller is the best option for an emmersive feel i use the xbox wireless i will buy this game as it looks like it has a full story mission to follow you play sitting down so very comfortable for long sittings demo is around 5 minutes long ai reminds me a bit of Portal hope thay keep it light and funny"

Tf2,"play this game do the achievement when u go to first clockworks tower then u recieve the Tf2 hat the game itself is quite good fun too its free as well and u dont need money to buy stuff u get them free as u level up d"
Portal,"great addition to the Portal lore and great brain teaser to kill time get it"
Team_Fortress_2,"competes with Team_Fortress_2 in the amount of time i ve spent playing dress up unironically"
Tf2,"this game for me was a real gem admittedly i am not a big fan of puzzle games that involves a stealth mechanic but with the unique mechanic that is the crosslink system the game becomes a lot less of just waiting and moving and waiting and moving but instead becomes more like setting up a complex mouse trap that incapacitates every guard in the building with the flick of a switch and that s where the fun comes from not the hiding and the stakes of being found but trying to find the quickest and easiest way to the objective through utilisation of the environment the story is clever well written but short the level design is top notch and with the implementation of a steam workshop supported level editor i can see a much longer playtime through the various community levels oh and you get a Tf2 hat so even if you don t like stealth games there s a demo that you can test the water with and you never know it might just be that one good game you never see comin g"
Dota_2,"you haven t played Dota_2 yet well what are you waiting for click that damn install button i could go on forever talking about how amazing this game is but i simply don t have the time so what i will say is that you can not have steam and not play or at least try this game"
Dota_2,"it has destroyed what charred tattered remenants of a social life left in the wake of Dota_2 10 10"
Tf2,"not really much fun it s Tf2 once you get to a certain point and it s not even balanced the free to play users can not trade while the premium users can and thus you re crippled if you aren t paying them up until level 20 a few hours you re stuck in a grind against ais then you can opt to do some small number of missions with random players against ai once more but it s largely about the pvp play at that point sadly the pvp isn t much fun because the leveled and paying players are better equiped by a fairly good margin skip it"
Tf2,"2 200 hours of pure heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kickin fun this is a must have for all people who have a steam account people say Tf2 is a cod copy and when they do i check tab to see how many times this a hole had been dominated if you re just starting off i highly reccomend soldier he is a great starting off character he has decent health and damage and racist remarks that ll keep you laughing for days if you want to be the favourite on your team switch to medic and heal some folks or equip blutsauger medi gun and bone saw and just go full on battle medic a great gamode to start off in is control point it shows you how to get around efficently with great big maps but whatever you do avoid being seen wearing the gibus at all times unless painted this has to be the very best f2p game there is 10 10"
Portal,"easily one of the best games i have ever played amazing story beautiful but simple world characters with personality amazing music and exciting but puzzling platforming i would recommend this to anyone especially players of Portal and the stanley parable"
The_Community,"left 4 dead 2 is the most funnest game i ever played a little difficult but that s what makes the game fun but then it becomes the most crappiest game ever because The_Community sucks i played on a lot of servers and most of them contains a holes know it alls perverts bossy and much more i met a few people who were fun to play with notice the keyword few i met like one or three that s it the rest just really sucks i ve been kicked from three two serevers for making one or two mistakes The_Community is basically saying you have to be perfect at this game nobody wants newbies to play now i m too scared to play with other people because they re just a holes i recommened this game because it s fun in single player but i advise you to stay away from the servers it s for your own good p s i todally didn t steal one of my firends review 3"

Tf2,"one of the best f2p first person shooters out there a harmonic combination of humour strategy and excitement come together to form a must have game although team fortress 2 is nearly 5 years old the fps action never has a dull moment i recommend that anyone interested in Tf2 should download the game without hesitation"

The_Community,"i had a long hard think about it and yes it is a lot of money for what is essentially a few new guns it was a lot of money for 2 new helicopters but what i failed to understand then was that bohemia do things differently they re not your activision or ea that spam out the same un original dlc time and time again just as a simple cash grab bohemia listen to their community granted you re being constructive with your critisizm and they aren t scabbing money off you for cheap remember karts all funds raised from that went to charity helicopters and marksmen are priced as they are because you support the developers and development of the game we ve been given a bulk of the dlc for free infact we ve been given everything for free in the recent downloadable content all bar the ability to pilot the two new helicopters and a new showcase for sling loading i m not a professional when it comes to game development but i understand the constraints a small team like bohemia have and i pledge my support to them because they ve made a series that not even your most popular shooters today come close to rivling something that will come in the future is bigger dlc much like baf pmc and acr were to arma 2 there just needs to be a better understanding within The_Community of bohemia s goals and aims with this game i ve seen many people hang so much heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit on this game yet they re not able to see the greater picture"
Men_Of_War,"for people who love the Men_Of_War series you should definately give call to arms a try although its early access and there is no vehicles in multiplayer yet i definately recommend this game if you ever wanted a modern age in Men_Of_War though i would like to request that the helicopters should be able to hover like in Men_Of_War vietnam and maybe you should add an animation where troops zipline from the helicopter instead of landing in the middle of a battlefield and pretty much get shot down instantly apart from my request i guess the game is 9 10 just add more vehicles and maybe more factions but i dont know about that though it would be cool if there were more factionsmaps vehicles new animationsmore units and maybe battleships maybe"
Csgo,"i give the game 9 10it is a good game im not sure about the skins though it makes it look like Csgo like game now since they added safes to crack its pretty much the Csgo unboxing boxes getting stuff the micro trancastions skins and the safes are kind of a bad idea i don t like itbut overall i think it is a great game"
Portal,"this was a really edgy mod it adds to the lore of Portal and gives it s own spicy story though i did noclip like half of the game because was extremely hard in my opinion i wouldn t call that a complaint though as it was made to be hard besides that i still enjoyed the majority of the game the voice acting in this is impressive too if you enjoyed Portal 2 then you should definitely get this as it is free"

Team_Fortress_2,"while i don t play it anymore Team_Fortress_2 is an amazing game it s fun and has a surprising amount of backstory with the comics and meet the videos every class feels different and is well balanced can t say the same for some items though and the modding community makes the game even greater by adding new content such as skins new gamemodes and new models Team_Fortress_2 is a game that everyone should try out and play with friends 4 5"

Metro_2033,"metro last light has the revamped but faithful aesthetic that all sequels do and a hint of the brooding quality of 2033 but sadly last light has the texture of nothing more than an expansion for the original masterwork last light s main attraction the campaign holds an uneven tale that varies from cliched to thrilling but it chiefly favours the middle ground of these two the first half to 3 quarters of the story lacks the startling originality and intense desolate air 2033 portrayed to remarkable effects but with the gritty and grimy ambiance used as a crutch last light stays above water and carries the player through with few articulate qualms save the dated ai and unabashed exposition present in almost every encounter it is when we reach the final act in last light that things begin to crack and crumble a rushed conclusion pooled with little climax creates a palpable sense of disheartenment as if our long winding journey towards this heavily anticipated finale was a waste of time alas this disappointment is what i ultimately walked away from last light with a spasmodically engrossing but stilted phase in the metro series gunplay and environments are barely worth mentioning as they follow the same archetypal structure of their predecessor but with slightly improved graphics caked over the top the main resonating feature in last light is sadly displeasure but then again it would be a miracle for this game to even come close to the staggering uniqueness and darkness that Metro_2033 was best known for 6 5 10 i m only recommending this because a thumbs down is a bit too harsh"
Tf2,"Tf2 great game worth buying the orange box but it s free to play thanks to the great gaben i think it s worth the download p s no team needs 5 spys please go medicp s s there s alot of bronys and there often mvp"
Tf2,"the only thing i don t like about this game is that i can t get shovel knight s hat in Tf2"
The_Community,"this game is a great game let me rephrase that this game was a great game wonder why i ll tell you why first off being honest i used to absoluteley love playing this game even before it was on steam the matches were fun balanced friendly and all out great even though the robot building was a bit tough i liked it as it gave me challenge to buid something cool but allow me to learn from what works and what doesn t but then it was introduced to steam first up what i though when i saw it first arrive on steam i was like oh awesome it s on steam now now i can play with my friends it was good for quite a while but then they started updating alot more at first it was pretty good with the addition of armoured blocks and electroplates amongst other things but then the later updates happened they are what annoyed me from what i saw with those later updates were new blocks and some new game mechanics and matchmaking some were alright but others were absoluteley horrible ideas to even get to the development without asking The_Community what they wanted as if it s freejam s way of saying we don t give a damn about what The_Community wants added we just want more money and this kind of behavior really annoyed me as for one thing they changed they removed the armoured blocks for what heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing colours that you need premium for more than 4 types or was it the fact they wanted to attempt to balance the entire battle challenge of the game they also removed the pilot seat like that s what defined the shape of your robot and how you designed it as they likely would ve though it being to easy to be killed they removed it not only did they add new mechanics that heavily unbalanced the battles by having a 10sec no hit repair time delay that allows anyone to fully repair their bot if they stay untouched for 10 seconds but they changed the entire tech tree so many heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing times it can t even be called a tech tree anymore it s more of a damn tech spiral now while it used to be you had to earn points to select what you wanted to unlock instead of leveling up to get each item consecutively like they ve done now and the fact that they ve set it with each conescutive item tier the price is drastically increased so most people will get premium to spend real money for ir i understand that they need money to keep it being developed but honestly 500 in game credit price increase for one tier higher in which most people can t be bothered mustering enough in game credits to buy alot of those as that s what most people do worst part is with the addition of the robot factory which is just a market where people can sell people thier robots so new players that get what they want will just purchase a high tier bot and use that which makes the game s already unbalanced rank matching even worse to end this review rant if i made a review of this game before it was on steam and i would say that you should get and you should play it but i m not instead i m saying that you should not play it if you are unable to spend real money for this game as it basically a money making machine for the company and here s a message for the devs and freejam chnage what you have done to this game listen to The_Community don t just look at a few people saying that they don t like something or they would rather something listen to the people that actually care that actually want this game to be fun and something that they can play and actually enjoy playing it instead of being annoyed by the tryhards with bought robots"
The_Community,"this is a good game and here s why first off this game is not just a game with a few levels it has many and with the involvment of The_Community the amount of levels is almost limitless so you have many levels to challenge yourslef with and you can make your own levels so others may challenge themselves on your levels next is the fact that it uses music to create amazing game immersion with the levels being created so well that they are in time with the song used for that level so if you create your own level make it to a song so it fits perfectly not too much to say about this game as it has such a small amout of amazing features but there is the fact that there are enough challenging acievements to keep you playing it for weeks on end unless you don t even care about achievements the levels should keep you going anyway there is one thing that i would like to ask of the developers can you please add more sources for songs so people can use songs that can t be on newgrounds so that way people aren t limited by the newgrounds audio pages"

The_Community,"miscreated is a multiplayer open world survival game in which you fight against the elements environment and living beings after a devastating war you will start in the world with a t shirt jeans and a flash light in which your goal will be to gear up by scavenging nearby houses car parks schools and other potential looting grounds for cars weaponry crafting components and tools combined with trying to avoid or possibly kill the existing mutants or survivors something to note considering every other survival game has this issue is The_Community isn t entirely a kill on sight type of mentality which is good you ll get people chatting with you trading or even possibly grouping up to defend against bandits or you may even decide to build your own base and hoard all the loot in the universe the developers also seem very passionate about their game and are listening to feedback and followed by that is great ideas for future updates which will definitely make this game even better personally i would like to see more mutants so i d be swarmed with no hope of surviving possibly increasing the limitations on how many objects you can have in your base followed by storage containers so you can hold all your items instead of throwing some away also i would like to see the temperature system back because i ve heard people talk about it and it sounds very interesting i highly recommend this game for i have enjoyed my time so far i shall continue playing this whilst also keeping an eye out for the magnificent updates which take place join us now we need more people to jump on and get involved in the carnage"
The_Community,"an outstanding game that s so polished in it s current state that it almost seems complete i d pay the price of a triple a game even if there s only infantry warfare currently even with that in mind there s so many variations of outcomes fortification opportunity and tactical plays that will never make any scenario seem the same what s even better is almost if not all the player base follow orders word to word which makes the game vastly superior to any military game out there in the current mix on top of that The_Community is mature and friendly and is always willing to help summary this is truely the best community i ve had the pleasure of playing with and will continue playing with to the ends of time 10 10"
Csgo,"this game is like Csgo but u do minigames and unlock different weapons its a bit like dirty bomb except its more like a first person shooter but roughly more great to enjoy if you are playing dirty bomb you should go and get this game"
The_Community,"this game was amazing i loved The_Communitythe serversthe lotand not to mention that its bloody challenging and thats what makes the game fun theres nothing i can say bad about this game i recently got false vac banned from the game and im warning to anyone who gets this game to make sure that you be careful until valve fixes the vac system i was offline and at school when i got vac banned from cs go i am not wasting another 15 just to get vac banned again but still highly recommend it peace out"
Tf2,"amazing game like Tf2 and minecraft together so if you like both you will love this game"
The_Community,"what do you want me to say about it you can do everything on this beautiful game if it wasn t for The_Community this game would be terrible this game for 9 99 is an absolute bargain for the amount of hours you can get out of this beautiful game"
Team_Fortress_2,"team fortress 2 i was very confused the first time i played i chose sniper which was at the time the only class i understood i got a few kills and was starting to enjoy this game but suddenly this pyro that had a pink jacket and a plunger on his her head poped out of nowhere and killed me with his alien looking flamethrower i at the time freaked the hell out and was like this game is insane that was a long time ago and now i find myself playing much more Team_Fortress_2 than i should and i now realise this game is not a first person shooter it is an all out war between a bunch of psycopaths wearing the weirdest crap they can find on the steam market this game will take a while to get used to but there is never a dull moment of gameplay and has new content coming out every few months so if you are reasonable at shooting things have enough money to keep up with the fashion trends and have lots of hours spare there is no game i would recomend more than team fortress 2"

The_Community,"tl dr mechanics and late game equipment are good and well done early game is incredibly difficult and The_Community is quite literally aids beginning in rust is very difficult by yourself even playing with friends is difficult you spawn with a rock and a torch and you have to get wood and stone to create tools like hatchets and pickaxes then you need cloth to make a sleeping bag for a spawn point or to get your friends into the same area as you and hope to find that one person who s willing to lend a hand in rust morals don t exist everyone will try to kill you for the stupidest of reasons mining an ore node someone was nowhere near guess what you died that guy wants that ore node for himself and he s not gon na let you and your naked body take it but let s assume you got past all that you built a base and have your materials in chests all neat and tidy you have an airlock for your house which is locked with armoured doors which makes it all the more difficult for raiders to get in you find other people who are willing to help you progress with your little game and everything seems pretty nice everyone is still out for your blood even the people you trusted you may or may not come back to find yourself dead because disconnected players don t disappear oh no your character goes to sleep leaving you out in the open for someone to just walk by somehow get into your house and then take everything you own death is inevitable like in all games but it happens way too often here the wolves and bears don t kill you people do people who have no liking for anyone else and don t care how recently they spawned people who are going to claim to be friendly then blast your face full of bullets people who just want to annoy the everliving crap out of you just because they can if you re into The_Community more than the game mechanics doubtful then this is something to steer well clear of if you re into mechanics and willing to lose your soul morals to the game go right ahead it s not my 20 anyway"
Tf2,"such game play for hours wow this game is so fun and its like Tf2 but with normal weps and with duck abilities theres the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing awp that kills with 1 shot but im not good at aiming thats why i play with ak 47 and m4a1 s you can gain money with this game how its simple playing the game"
Dota_2,"this game is really fun to play i ve been playing Dota_2 for 6 years with my brother since dota warcraft 3 the frozen throne"
Tf2,"it is one of the best f2p fps shooters on the market with a great cartoon like art style and lots of hats so if you are tired of fps without sytle Tf2 is a great game for you just do not log on a trade server and trade with someoneever it will ruin your life"
Dota_2,"9 10 would suggest this game to any and all types of gamers Dota_2 is the perfect game what with its disgusting fan base community and its highly addictive nature that will ruin your life if you enjoy pushing aside your responsibilities and loved ones in order to achieve a 6 hour meth binge this is the game for you given 9 due to the lack of pictures of gaben in game"
Tf2,"Tf2 is a class based shooter with a cartoony style you can easily invest hundreds of hours and dollars into this game and not get bored it is really fun and i recommend getting it it s free so why not"
The_Community,"The_Community is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit its difficult to set up a server but other than that the game play is fine i ll give it a rating of 4 out of 10 potatoes"
Nether,"im really sorry to say because this game looked awsome so much that i purchased it but i feel it is missing the mark they say you can access most of the sky scrapers but thats barely true and even the ones you can have a sad mdk gta3 feel 2 them i really dont know why it recomends a quad core 2 4gz cpu because the graphics resemble something from the early 200 s and either their rendering system is doing the crysis thing of rendering things that you cant even see or something else is amiss but the few servers i did try were dull and uneventfull im not doing the narrow view thing and comparing to dayz because frankly i think state of decay is a better zombie survival game but i just found Nether underwelming dont get me wrong i liked some of the texture details and the mechanism as far as encorouging co opperative play rather than just killing every1 2 steal their things thats something that sux about most pvp pve games rust as an example great game and well thought out but most people will kill you rather than work with you to survive but i liked the idea in this that you have clear reasons why you should work together and the safe zones are cool alot to do in there i guess what im trying to say is im underwhelmed at the moment and will have to just check back at a later point when things have been updated a bit more look forward to future updates"
Starbound,"right at the moment of writing this review i have bf4 gta5 and crysis3 waiting for me to play yet i am playing this game i know this is unfinished but the potential of what this game could become is epic imagine dayz minus the extreme clunkiness and a shooter capability and ease of use like cod or cs voice chat base building and bandits included if you are not against early access or even if you are this is one of three games worth spending money on the others being dayz and Starbound update recent patch has ruined gameplay as the night cycle has gotten longer due to a new lighting engine but this does not effect players with the gamma cheat on their physical monitors battles overnight has completely turned pro gamma cheaters getting killed at night is now a much higher possibility"
Team_Fortress_2,"who would have guessed that this game would have been a free to play f2p game it is amazing knowing an amazing game like this is free there is a reason why this game is called Team_Fortress_2 this game really need coorporation between players and a lot of teamwork i can tell those who have never played a game like this without teamwork your team is doomed there are different classes character various of maps and modes can t really get bored unless your team is not cooperating at all by the way there is a tutorial in the game which really helps for those newbies i would personally pick the soldier as your first try class he uses a rocket launcher the first time i use this guy i was all like eat rocket while shooting randomly anyway he does a lot of damage plus your health is one of the highest in the game you can also shoot at your feel right after you jump to rocket jump this will give you advantage to quickly get into the front lnes to get to a higher spot or just to run away from trouble but be warned this trick damages you too use it wisely totally recommend this game for those who have a gang of friends starting the game with friends is way better than starting alone with above average strangers"

Evolve,"this is an honest review of ark survival Evolved i have played 150 hours in 4 weeks for those who have not played ark it is the best survival game i ve ever played alot of people say this game is bad because you loose all your stuff over night but this is only on pvp servers you can also play on pve servers where your stuff can not be stolen the amount of content in this game is amazing if you have not bought the game already i highly recommend it if you are worried about loosing your stuff play on a pve server and you will not regret it i recommend community pve servers like mmoblitz s server if you are interested in pvp then you will have the risk of loosing all your stuff when you are not online but this can be stopped by having an active player at all times i highly recommend ark to anyone who is interested in it you won t be disapointed"
Css,"lo recomiiendo mas que nad si tienen el gmod ya que ahi todo es Css"
The_Community,"as much as getting killed on sight which is annoying this game is like starting an adventure having to do whatever you can to survive i play this game often and i usually play with friends because playing on a popular server you are bound to be killed if you play alone when attacking someone when you are alone but they have another three people with them even though this game is still in alpha i believe facepunch has done a brilliant job in making this game they keep adding in new features and they listen to The_Community i give this game a 8 5 10"
Csgo,"why can t i get in to to the Csgo but i can get in to the other game"
Css,"gmod is one of my favourite games on steam i reccommend this game to everyone note you need Css counter strike source or at least the content used in Css in order to play most game types"
The_Community,"i have a friend i play this with but multiplayer is pretty boring alone The_Community is dead"
Dota_2,"played Dota_2 as pudge and i was hooked 10 10 would be hooked again"
Csgo,"red_heart Csgo is one of the best shooters i have seen so far as its graphics are stunning the gameplay is simple and is competitive i recommend anyone looking for a shooter game to buy buy Csgo red_heart"
Tf2,"psa overkill s crimefest updates have added pay2win microtransaction weapon skins with stat boosts that are a straight copy of cs go Tf2 h1z1 weapon cases down to rarity wear muh super rare legendary knife omg this update also ruined weapon balance as pistols are now the most powerful weapons even moreso than shotguns overkill has made poor attempts to make right their decision of copy paste microtransaction systems by adding drills keys as droppable however the droprate is ridiculously low and shares a weekly timer with the safes crates the crimefest updates were meant to be free for the whole community and long ago promised they d never put in microtransactions but now if you want the best possible experience of this game you have to a buy the gameb buy the dlcc play for several weeks and hope to get crates and or drillsd give in and buy the drills and safes to get a random weapon skin that may not even be the one you need so that you can have the full stats if people continue to accept this kind of behaviour it ll never stop and become the norm do not accept this as something that s fine to do even if they made drills droppable nobody knows what the droprate for them is and it appears that having a higher infamous droprate does not in fact affect the chance for dropping safes drills as a result payday 2 has become an extremely greedy game that you need to dump a lot of money into to have the full experience and can not be recommended i will modify this review if these changes are ever removed or altered enough to become reasonable again"
Evolve,"let s get all of this clear i played over twenty hours in the beta and it refused me to play any more apparently my beta time ran out however throughout every hour of this game i was finding new ways to play new tricks to try and new methods to win the round i had only played two different classes trapper and monster only two i can t imagine what else i could have learnt about the game if only i had played more i played twenty hours and was still stuck on how daisy worked when i first saw gameplay and trailers i was insistent on how un re playable it seemed i stuck around though i entered for the beta and as i mentioned earlier i was hooked wow that looked pretty epic and i wonder if they would fall for was coming out of my mouth at least once each round they say in the evacuation tutorial tutorial for the evacuation gamemode that there are and i quote over 800 00 possible combinations for the ultimate in replayability that s the so called campaign of Evolve there are something like five gamemodes at the moment if you weren t blind enough to read the text if you chose the evacuation gamemode then you would know this not to mention the amount of tutorials they had already released in the tutorials section which displayed information about all the gamemodes that were going to be available on release so for all you whiners out there about how boring it is and how you got bored after two hours and how that must have had an oh so terrible impact on your life keep reading it gets even better i also read in a lot of the thumbs down reviews that the game is multiplayer only for your information i have just tested the single player completely offline disconnected from the wifi offline and i almost got my teeth kicked in by a bunch of normal difficulty bots i tried both teams you can play not only evacuation mode but also any other game mode that you wish ready offline and still have a hell of a challenge to it if you had only stopped to understand that when you get access to the open beta for a game such as this a game designed to play online with other people that the developers must evaluate how the game operates under stress of course there are going to be a hell of a lot of bugs of course there are going to be faulty optimizations this is what a beta is for so that you may tell them that there are bugs and so that they may fix them i found over thirteen little glitches in the beta one included a little bug where if you tried to climb a wall and the dome fell right in front of you as you went mid animation to climb you would simply slide down the wall and get stuck halfway inside the dome when it was released yesterday i immediately went to try it out and well fixed same place probably not the exact same time in the animation but it was definitely within the time frame needed to get me stuck stop complaining about bugs if all you did was play the beta in hopes for it to be perfect okay one thing i must sit on the fence about is the dlc costs i agree that it costs too much but i disagree that it s enough to make you not buy the game firstly because the dlc does not add any bonuses other than aesthetics and different characters ok cool different characters great mhm you don t need them at all whatsoever nobody said to you that in order to play this game you have to buy all the dlc or in order to enjoy the game you have to buy all the dlc not a single person but those who didn t bother reading what the dlc actually is the tier system in the game does not i say again does not give you access to new monsters and characters because they re stronger it gives you access to them to keep you playing the game to find new play styles and combinations and weaknesses and strengths and opportunities where one person s ability might come useful where yours currently isn t that doesn t mean that you will completely forget the first character you used in a certain class no instead i went back to the original character because her toolkit suited my playstyle sorry for the fairly long post everybody but i just hope that this clears any doubts that you may have had about the game be it with singleplayer issues or bugs or dlc if you have anymore questions then feel free to contact me through this account or send me an email at RIRE gmail comthankyou for reading and go slay some monsters"

Terraria,"this game i would recommend but that recommendation is slim deepworld is more of just some timewaster hobby than it is a game most quests i have done are too restrictive or i deem are impossible due to the current state the world doesn t have a unique pattern of scenery griefing seems to be the top contendor of that issue and the game still has current bugs and glitches that are yet to be patched even though they are simple to encounter and the idea that the entire game revolves around online play is despicable maybe add some sort of singleplayer mode or custom since the game kind of revolves on Terraria take tips off them but there are some reason that i have that make me feel this game could be one of the best the skill bar is a fantastic idea more unlockables and it makes the game more challenging and addictive different weather and environmental hazards such as acid rain keep you on your toes while i said this game was more of a hobby i didn t mean a bad one"
Tf2,"team fortress 2 is one of my favorite steam games plus like how you can get alot of infinite weapons and that most of the weapons can be sometimes overpowered i like the really cool cosmedics that you can get in the game and that you can craft weapons and trade from your inventory too my only downside is that there hackers and cheaters in there which they can actually hack in some valve servers but other than that this game is really extreme epic awesome and cool oh and p s i like the man vs machine mann co battles that is all i have to say for now but i have a lot more that i have to share about this game this is my own opinion on Tf2 and do the best that you can do with this game valve"

The_Community,"this is possibly my favourite game of all time despite the shotty job that they did porting it over to pc some simple to install mods make this game one of my best experiances on any platform the challenge it gives you is the perfect thing for anyone who wants to test their skills as a gamer the way The_Community has decided it works is in my opinion quite good the higher your level the worse you re doing and having a higher level makes the game harder since the better players that you could summon for help have lower levels then you would think this is a almost perfect game if it didn t have the issue of people modding characters to be op despite their level and eqiupment none the less this is an amazing game and anyone considering buying dark souls should buy it while they can you won t regret it"

Undertale,"slightly spoiler y as silly as it sounds my experience playing Undertale was just that an experience gameplay wise it s incredibly simple walk talk battle enemies but it s how it utilizes those simple elements and creates a powerful story centered around it as you walk from point a to point b you can feel that you have made a journey you re exploring this foreign perilous world you grow attached to the interesting and quirky characters you meet and the way you face against your enemies is actively shaping the outcome of your adventure this is a game were like in real life everything has powerful consequences that you can t just run away from even if you try the age old habit of save scumming something that Undertale loves to pull apart and analyze a lot can be taken from Undertale and very rarely does a game succeed in so many ways on leaving a mark on its player many of the game s concepts the deconstruction of the rpg the psychology of in game characters and the godlike powers of a player to manipulate the game s world can of course be preached by lesser artist s but tobyfox has combined visuals gameplay story music and character and shaped them all into such a unique game that has proven it deserves all the recognition it gets while i may not have the heart to play the game again i absolutely want to see other players experience it for the first time like i did please pick up this game if you have the chance it s worth it"

Terraria,"let me tell of a recent adventure i had while playing this with my friend we started on a large island wasn t as large as i thought it would be but it was large enough of course we started gathering woods first so we could have a shelter for the first night whereas my friend focused more on the framework i focused more on making our shelter look pretty by adding a japanese themed roof once we placed the last chair the guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his our first night wasn t bad we just stayed inside made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range so for the whole night we shot zombies with our bows and arrows the rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that we collected woods and sometimes stones improved on our shelter which eventually turned into a tower and eventually mined we kept mining a specific network which in time lead us to the underworld now mind you we played on hardcore so if i died then i die for good on that server anywho our first trip to the underworld wasn t too bad we made a hellevator and rode it down to the underworld we scouted for a bit until we were attacked by demons when we lost more that 50 of our health we knew it was time to go back and so we teleported back home with our magic mirrors so from that day forward our mission was to mine the hell out of hell now this is where the story ends i thought for sure that i would have died from a demon or fell and slipped into lava but no it was from something else entirely i decided to discover more of the network of caves and hope to find treasure chests here and there but no i stepped on a pressure plate and a boulder fell on me i died while my friend laughed and stole my items that was when i stopped playing Terraria then update 1 3 came and i was like yipee i wonder what other deadl y contraptions redigit has in store for me pls excuse bad inggris"

Well_There,"poor oversight by magic 2015 developers in the game positives include a catchy theme song ability to construct a deck to however you like storyline is not a bad inclusion opening more boosters to provide anticipation and excitement sadly however the negatives definately out weigh the positives you are restricted in deck building to a limited selection of cards after you have completed the campaign unless you which ti invest in boosters to increase your card pool matching up against others who have superior cards or even duplicates or sets of 4 card s whom have purchased additional boosters not only makes deck building difficult ineffective but also increases the likelihood that you will be demorilised over and over again in matches against other opponents in 1 v 1 or free for all matching i generally enjoy purchasing this product for the puzzle games last turn puzzles a few years ago were amazing and difficult challanging 2014 however showcases some very sub par puzzles games and this year Well_There are none i played one game of free for all on 4 v 4 and i felt so far away from the game table i requested my flatmate to provide me a magnifine glass myself and another player also realised 4 turns in that we had already lost when one of the players threw down some superior cards for which we had not even access to this put me off continuing playing this game into the future as really there is no point unless i am wishing to invest into this suggestions would be to at least bring two headed giant match making back a level par card selection by perhaps charging a set 15 fee from the start and not this micro transaction booster option which is poor oversight in my opinion and perhaps even a tournament mode where equal par magic the gatherers could paticipate tournaments of 10 players etc round robin to then provide a level based system and a decent points rating for those wishing to climb to the top in rankings over time by winning more tourney s etc rating interface music score story concept 6 10 as what else can you do with a story really gameplay campaign 5 10 as well the ai seems to get the perfect run of cards sometimes s deck building feature 8 10 as this is very flexiblecard selection 2 10 extremely limited unless additional investments made gameplay vs human 3 10 for the reason you will become frustate that you are unable to build a deck that is consistent without investment into more booster packs overall i would probably rate magic 2015 4 10"

Csgo,"this game has surprised me before i thought it was bad so i didn t get it and now i just tried and i am in love with this game suprisingly it nearly reached the level to counter strike global offensive besides the graphics year and different game modes however this game is very casual like team fortress 2 if you have experience in Csgo and cssource will be very easy as they ar pretty much the same however this game might need to improve a bit in the model of how you play so in my opinion i think this game should be a must have for casual players not sure about competitive so thumbs up i reccomend this game"

The_Community,"cs go this game is not for all people The_Community is so so weapon balancing is a large issue only certain maps are decent with the rest underpopulated or terrible and it has a monopoly surrounding what your guns look like in game with no redeeming value outside of my gun looks cool look at it look at it aren t i cool but i really don t give a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit about any of that stuff because the game is amazing infinite replayabilty online with intense competitive modes fun community maps to have fun with and a great casual mode to let you get some practise in basically this game is a first person shooty bang bang kill bad good guys within time limit or boom kind of game with a learning curve to be good you must 1 learn the maps and all callouts yes i said callouts 2 learn how the guns work spray patterns magazine sizes varied damage decrease over distance where to shoot a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit pull out time reload time etc the list goes on 3 communication learn to talk with your teamates or you are basically useless if you do not have a headset and mic do not buy this game 4 and a whole lot of other stuff that i dont want to list because it would take too long and im lazy but you don t just need to learn it yourself thousands upon thousands of people post tutorials every week about the game i would personally recommend warowl through youtube and other media sites watch a pro game or two the competitive side of cs go can be viewed as a learning experiance as well as entertainment this game is great but you need to commit if you want to get better recommended if you like tough fps not like cod 8 10"
Portal,"makes other physics based games like Portal look like piles of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit"
Dota_2,"this game has a huge learning curve if you want to enjoy this game you will have to practice a lot but once you get past this learning curve the game gets infinitely more fun it s especially fun when you play in a party with friends communication is key in this game there are dozens of awesome experiances you will have with Dota_2 if you put the time and effort into it there are also heaps of guides and help that you can use from the game or the internet to get you started please try this game"
The_Community,"so i came into this game full of hope and high expectations the game delivered on all of them however The_Community did not if you enjoy brigading biased moderators and a generally smug passive aggressive pve crowd that will go out of their way to shutdown any remotly pvp inclined interaction then this is the game for you there is no player versus player piracy bounty hunting or combat in general short of highly organized and rather drab league play nothing dynamic and engaging basically this is a space trucking and tourism sim"
Terraria,"i love sending zombies sprawling from my laser minigun which i got from a martian saucer which can only be fought after defeating the golem who is the boss right after plantera who is a giant angry rose that will give you a staff to summon tikimen these tikimen are really good for taking out the mechanical bosses who are the bosses that spawn after the wall of flesh has been defeated the only to summon the wall of flesh is by killing a voodoo demon and dropping the guide voodoo doll into the lava of the underworld which is the deepest point of Terraria before going to the underworld you should take out all the prehard mode bosses"

Evolve,"this game is very fun im a huge fan of the total war series and this is a great title and probably better than rome 2 or some of the other newer titles great combat awesome seiges and you have to use a good degree of strategy to beat your opponenet but what really make this game for me is the mods the mods are the best making total overhauls or just small adjustments its what makes this game long lasting for me my favourite would be age of petty kings a game of thrones mod great fun as i conquer my enemies and crush their skulls the generals also have alot of character as they Evolve over your playthrough the spearmen are op and you can basically destroy anything with them with minimal loses in my playthrough also on my desktop which has windows eight the game crashes every time i open it be carefull about that recomend you get this fantastic game and replay value over 100"

Portal,"the ball is a fps puzzler game from teol studios and tripwire interactive the publishers of killing floor and red orchestra this is takes about 8 hours to beat like the desciption says this game is like Portal meets gears of war and why because for Portal the ball object is like the companion cube where you place that spot and place another and that and gears of wars the underground level designs and the creature aliagator things are similer to the locust soldiers and the graphics is powered by unreal engine which looks good the story was ok and the combat mechanics didn t impress me that much when you beat the game there s also a surivial mode which you must surivie which waves of enemies i give this game a 6 8 out of 10"

Undertale,"this is another game similar to the likes of the stanly parable it is not so much of a game and more of an experience an experience which if you do not do a huge ammount of dawdling and exploration cant last more than 2 hours the gameplay consists of walking through hallways listening to a narrator discuss what you are seeing the only gameplay clearly visible is the use of a simple puzzle as a mean of storytelling if anyone had trouble with that puzzle i am curious to know how you continue to function however the content taht is within the game is difficult to review its a bit like Undertale and other heavy story based games where if i mention something within the game it will ruin the experience overall though i would not say that this was an allright experience but it feels kind of like something i would have found on the likes of gamejolt for freebies rather than a 10 game even so it is still worth playing in my opinion and at the time of writing it is the holiday sale which reduces the price down to 6 which can be a more justifiable pricetag in my opinion just know that 1 it is not a game2 it is entirely possible on the first playthrough to beat the game in about an hour and a half 3 the ideas explored can be done better and have a very specific person in mind which would give a great emotional response if you happen to be one of those people social anxiety otherwise it may not be a worthwhile experience 4 for someone to get the most enjoyment you must be soemone who does creative work not specifically games you could be an animator artist designer ect and still get the same expereience as a game dev overall i would say for the price of 6 i paid for it i would give it a 6 5 10 however i beleive that it should still be played for the experience that it offers"
Tf2,"first things first this will not replace your desktop no matter how much you try it is just too inneficent to replace a wall with icons to double click and open up nearly anything with a 3d enviroment that will take time walking inbetween shortcuts the only scenario where i think aa will be faster is in the case of a webcomic where instead of going to a website click on the icon wait a second and it opens up on your 3d desktopyou are playing this game because you want points for style and my is there much style to be had here even with the basic game one example i can give is if you find a good enough map you can make rooms for different items remember this game can be mounted onto other source games meaning you can use those maps a good thing to do would be to go into the gmod workshop and find a good map mount gmod onto aa and build a map from that whilst you are on the workshop look also for ragdolls models and other objects you would want to put onto your map my map has tanks from warhammer 40k legendary pokemon an artificial forest all on a star destroyer all with all my games creative software movies music ect neatly catergorised and placed onto the map from which i can see all visually rather than having to explore a music library or look down a list of my steam games of which i have hoarded over 100 now i even have a room dedicated to comics that i had bought on comixology and i can read them straight from that room anarchy arcade like many have said can be considered a mancave simulator i have to agree to an extent consider the possibilites of what you can do to this mancave do you want a simple appartment with quick and easy access to your items or do you want to go all out put your cave on the moon on one of those Tf2 trade servers i am working on rebuilding my cave in minecraftrealmsv2 at time of writing and will probably post to the workshop when i am finished working on it on a star destroyer or even if you really wanted to create your own map and share it to the workshop the source engine allows for that and its a matter of your skills as to whether or not you want to do that do you want your mancave to be simple videos posters music or do you want guards tanks a sphinx or my personal favourite a scarab from the halo franchice tldr this is for those who do not care for efficency and can only be considered more useful when you have too much stuff on your desktop where it becomes near impossible to read otherwise you can create the coolest desktop mancave the source engine allows for that"
Tf2,"this is a great game with adventures and also battle sprites they are cute i invite you guys to play tthis game is also best like Tf2 or dota sort of pbut just play this game band up and go adventure dalso good luck by ranking up leveles see you guys there my name is the campion add me tho p"

Undertale,"Undertale more like underbutt RIRE"
Csgo,"it s Csgo but way more difficult and tactical and instead of being round based it s more objective based where you complete the objectives on a map blowing caches up capturing points and when you get to the end that s a round maps are pretty good there s a good variety of long distance and close quarters combat eight different classes with different roles modular gear system chose your weapons attachments armour plate carrier etc it s good i personally prefer co op mode basically vs waves of bots with unlimited capacity"
The_Community,"dont be put off by my hours i probably had hundreds before this came to steampros tons of different biomes and scenarios give heaps of replayability unique events always make sure you have something to deal with great developer who always communicates with The_Community lots of work put into making colonists feel human decent combat system good ui lots of variety to how you build your base complex injury system hardly any bugs or crashes nice art stylecons making a base that isn t either built into a mountain or surrounded by mountains gives you a big disadvantage especially on higher difficulites end game can be a bit lacking either build a spaceship and escape or eventually get overrun by raiders overall a fantastic game well worth 30 usd"
Nether,"well as i ' m sure most of you have read do not buy this game if you do not like pvp or you are not very patient as for the game itself it is rather basic atm loot spawns in predefined areas the map is rather small smaller then dayz easily there is a lot of grinding to get later tier items or to build large bases unless you raid a lot most of the guns can be hard to handle that is why i prefer the pistols and bolt action my advice to new players is to find a server that has a low pop the closer to zero the better then you can learn about the other parts of the game also a well hidden base is better than a bigger base any day everyone can break down even the mightiest fort given enough time spent 12 hours once breaking down a castle with grenades also google an online map and get used to it also take note of loot spawns and areas that have a high resource density wooden buildings decay much faster than metal and are easier to break into when you want to build you have to craft foundations onto which you place pillars 4 in each corner depending on design you can then place a ceiling on it on which you can place more pillars since it also acts as a floor place walls windows doorways in between or place a stairwell in it it takes a lot of resources to build big buildings as well and then you have to maintain them on top of that animals also tend to spawn near loot areas but you can find some scattered around the map they are a great source of food and i have never had to go hungry past my first 3 days so actual survival is not that important if you do all right at the start once you get to high levels you will start to get bored and either want to raid pvp or build a big base after that though there is not too much you can do besides raiding and collecting airdrops graphics are okay buggy but it is in alpha sound is okay gunshots sound nice but might need tweaking explosions need tweaking not to many glitches and i have had no crashes my self netcode seems fine heaps of servers with little lag basically dont get this if you hate games like Nether and dayz unless you find a nice helpfull server or you dont understand what alpha is and have a short attention span i have had fun with it but it has reached a point where there is nothing new for me to do appart from kill people atm probs not worth 20 for what content you actually get but it will be interesting how they expand this and could be worth more then that in the future"

Dota_2,"heyguys as a long time addict i would like to give a honest though undoubtedly biased review of this game lifestyle drug playing this game is like taking yoga for 5 years training mercilessly day and night then finally surgically removing a rib in order to one day suck your own heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit only to discover that the relentless physical torment has left your junk in a hapless defective state what you will experience from playing this game is 99 9 flaming scapegoating and being killed by players more invested in this video game experience than you could ever hope to be the majority of mechanical game play consists of attacking an ai controlled unit at the last possible moment in order to obtain a pitiful amount of gold from it and then proceeding to repeat this action hundreds of times every single game still interested i will not question what may be wrong with you but seeing as you have read thus far i will let you in to this little secret the reason why people have played this game since it s inception and have never gotten bored of it this is the little 1 of pure untampered ecstasy it is the moment that the scales fall from your eyes to reveal the next level of complexity within the world of dota you once believed to be much simpler the moment you first overcome your opponent with skill you have sacrificed your blood sweat and tears to develop when the stars align and that wombo combo aces the 5 heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit boys stupid enough to challenge you and your brothers in arms when you comeback from mega creeps a checkmate in nearly all cases to snatch the victory which dangled so precariously in the jaws of defeat followed by talking so much heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit to the early good game flamer on the other team your mouth may as well be a colostomy bag this is the high you will achieve from this narcotic we call Dota_2 and you will without a doubt spend the rest of your life crawling miserably through the toxic sewerage ala public games in order to once more experience it in all of it s richness and warmth truth be told there is no guarantee that you will ever feel that same way again but it s worth trying i think"

Starbound,"29 8 15personally i think Starbound is excessive in a good way it has a mass of different places to explore along with so many features and quest rivalling terreria the main point is that there is still more to come and with so many features every addition is welome to an already pretty completed game"
Half_Life_2,"this is a testament to the fact that great mods and games come out of the half life series Half_Life_2 may had some boring times probably because it is a bit outdated but in this game there were none i do reccommend not having so many locked doors in the sequel also kudos to the ability to acess a computer"
Team_Fortress_2,"well im probaly not the first to say this but best fps game in the world the reason i like it so much is because its orginal unlike some of the other fps games out there you dont even have to fight you can just go around the map exploring and finding new things there is also so many taunts like the conga high five and many more there are also so many weapons to be found like the pain train the classic and so many more weapons there are also so many hats that are really cool get this game by the name of Team_Fortress_2 it is the best fps out there100 10"
Tf2,"okay after over 300 hours i will give a good review of this game after the hours of playing i can say if you are willing to be addicted to a game this isn t the choice it eats up a great amount of time and can litterally take money off you this game can be called hat simulator 2015 as it is litterally a hat simulator recent updates such as the gun mettle update gave this game elements of another game sold and published by valve counter strike global offensive or cs go using the reskin part of the stock weapons so far Tf2 is one of valve s most success full games but due to high amount of players moving to cs go due to lost interest in this game i highly suggest you take a look at cs go first then look at this unique piece of software that has been developed thank you for read and have a good one a501ut3z3r0"

Team_Fortress_2,"an interesting fps tower defense game light hearted and witty commentary and voice lines unique story and easy challenging levels of gameplay for both novice and experts alike the graphics are beautiful and have a very Team_Fortress_2 look and feel to them i ve logged over 70 hours in this game and have gotten every achievement and i still have new maps to play new weapons to use and different strategies to implement i definitely recommend this game as it s hours of fun for you and a friend if you wish regardless of what way you like to play up close and personal or further back and let all your traps do the work this game can cater to you but whatever method you choose to use just remember these orcs must die"

Super_Meat_Boy,"the rage Super_Meat_Boy is probably one of the most rage quitty games that i have ever played yet i still play it and try to beat the levels that i have rage quitted on in many occasions its a fun arcade adventure game with many levels and bosses but don t judge a game by its cover it is bloody gutty vommity and ragey it even has squirrels and rabbits jumping into saws so get this game and enjoy it if you can RIRE"
Team_Fortress_2,"another great game by valve Team_Fortress_2 to me seems like an fpsrpg first person shooter role playing game because you can choose between 9 classes each with different special abilities you can also buy find and do something else that i am not aware of to get items which range from humorous hats to show off to your friends to curious crates which may hold something special within i definately recommend this game to all you pyrotechnicians and assassins and everything in between because this will give you endless hours of fun"
Team_Fortress_2,"this is the type of game that can make anyone addicted especially a low life like me gameplayin Team_Fortress_2 you play as one of the 2 teams red or blue and choose beetween nine classes each having a specific role the speedy scout the idiot soildier the mysterious pyro the drunken demoman the russian badass slash cuttie patotie heavy the layback egghead engineer the helpfull though slightly crazy medic the australian steriotype sniper and the fancy guy that looks more like he should belong in payday then he does in a game spy you can collect weapons to dominate your oponents and hats dont even get me started on hats theres a good reason as to why this game is also known as hat simulator there are so many hats that not having one is considered a sin no matter how good you are at the game if you have no hats or are running around wearing a gibus with pyrovision googles and a mecanery badge sorry but your a newb you play in a majority of fairly straight foward matches and different match types control points capture the flag payload king of the hill doomsday and the most unique being the rage inducing mann vs machiene this game is high on teamwork and your gon na get your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kicked if you go in alone it is also noticable that there are many mods that keep the pros around like the slender mod the deathrun mod and the jailbreak mod even though g mod had all of these first this game will keep you playing for a very long time due to the constant updating of new material and bugs to play around with characters each character is very different each other they all originated from different countrys besides the scout the soildeir and the engineer that resides in the u s and they all brought theyre steriotypes with them and theyre atitudes and playstyles are so different its almost hard to beilieve that they get on fairly well graphics this is not the type of game that consentrates on being beutiful but the cartoon violence itchy and scratchy type gore is in high enough definition to satisfy most people looking for gore and yes there is a difference beetwen cartoon gore and horror gore replayability yes definitly you play as one class you get bored of that class you go on to another class and once your bored of all the clases your ready to try the first class again and as i said before this game keeps on updating keeping valve quite busy maybe thats why half life 3 hasnt been anounced also there are so many mods so many different maps and so many non porpuseful tactics cough friendlyism i just cant stop if you want a game that is fun and will last you years before you have done everything and has you slowly clawing your way to the to the top and where you meet freinds valuable trading partners go for it its free and is very cheap too go premium gameplay 9 10graphics 7 10overall 8 10 play it"
The_Community,"i m surprised the overall ratings for this game aren t negative or mixed yet still a decent game though just buy the game and dlcs during a sale to actually play the game without spending a lot of money editsince update 100 came out and microtransactions were removed the game is now going back to its roots overkill listened to The_Community and that the next generation of safes will be completely free except for the old gen you ll still need to use a drill to open them the revamped skill trees introduced by update 100 have changed the way you play the game in my experience at least some skills were nerfed inspire others were buffed sentry guns and some were merged with other skills in a way this new system allows more roleplay and tactics during heists oh and the update made akimbos and the saw to be usable by default which should have been in the game from the start anyway overkill also announced that they now own all the rights to the payday franchise which means that they ll support the game throughout this year to the end of 2017 i don t know what ll happen to the game at this point overkill gained most of their fans back and they support them in return so i guess that the game will survive after all"
Team_Fortress_2,"dirty bomb is a free and very enjoyable fast paced action shooter right up there with the likes of Team_Fortress_2 the game is fair on all player skill levels you ll find many servers with a level cap ensuring that everybody gets a fair chance there are micro transactions in place but there is no emphasis on using the system as all items that can be purchases using real cash may also be purchased using in game credits what s more is that these credits are earned very quickly and there are often events such as double xp and random loot drops which ensure that evey player gets the same opportunity to see what these top tier items are like yes i am aware that at the time of this review being written my playtime hours are rather low but that is mainly due to the fact that i am playing on old system while making do with a sub par internet connection with that being said i have made sure that i have explored most of what the game has to offer and i can come to the conclusion that diry bomb is a great game that deserves a place in everybody s steam library and after all it s free"
Portal,"nothing comes close to the entertainment money ratio that Portal 2 raises the bar to at least in the puzzle genre worth buying at any price"

Portal,"red trigger was an awesome experience its got a mysterious yet intresting storyline tough but good puzzles it s also one of the few puzzle games that require timing making the game more unique interesting and worth playing i would love to see a concept like red trigger become a big game that lasts hours like Portal 2 it s short but only made by one person with a tiny bit of assistance by others definintely an 8 10 especiialy because it s free"

Csgo,"jesus this game has it all first of all this is one of only a handful of shooters that offers proper competetive gameplay for people who dont want to make a team and sign up to a website and all that second this game is not pay to win you can still spend money but it all goes to cosmetics so the only factor that differs between players is their skill level just a quick thing the community the community in Csgo is massive and of course it has its ups and downs all communities have toxic players hackers scammers etc as well as helpers and friendly players but the one thing that strikes me about this game is that the devs gave it to us and we figured it out from there we discovered bhopping trading techniques and heaps of other stuff and that is what really strikes me about this game its that we as a community figured this game out for ourselves and even found some things that the devs didnt third the skins now personally i dont see why you would spend hundreds of dollars on an item with no beneficial value whatsoever but thats just me but apart from that the skins are actually a way of making money if you know how to trade you can go from bloody 4 cent skins to a 100 dollar knife without spending a single cent on the way p s never open cases they are a complete waste of time and money if you can get past the toxic players the hackers the smurfs the scammers the glitches and the plenty of other issues in the game its a blast good luck"

The_Community,"for those not familiar with what squad is it s essentially the new version of project reality which was a bf2 mod back in the day and is now a stand alone title that focuses on realism patience and teamwork however the game is quite dated now and has needed a serious upgrade like this for a while squad is currently in its alpha and while it looks much better than pr it s stripped of a lot of the features that make pr so great but rest assured these will be coming in the future i e vehicles even in alpha the game is well worth the price you re not going to find a more realistic team based modern shooter simulator outside of arma but in many ways this is much more accessible than arma as you don t need a clan or a good sized party to enjoy the full experience if you have yourself a good team who work together and know what they re doing then you re going to have a lot of fun with the game however there are a lot of new players right now who don t know how to play the roles so some games can get frustrating most players here as in project reality use mics and you re not really going to get by without one so i recommend you have one before purchase disclaimer this game requires teamwork communication and patience you might go an hour without getting a single kill and that s fine this isn t battlefield do not purchase this if you re not familiar with the likes of arma project reality or red orchestra or if you re not willing to learn the maps are huge with thousands of possibilities and choices when it comes to strategy and tactics the weapons are accurate sound effects are almost too real teams work together and you can see some amazing things in this game with a little initiative from squads The_Community is friendly supportive and willing to help always this is only alpha and there s so much more to come but for now what other game on steam can let you build a 50 cal position on a mountain top and rain fire on enemies kilometres away while your buddies help you with targeting and adjustments"
The_Community,"i have sunk 20 hours into this beta i dont think i have ever done that for any game in beta chosing to wait until it is a finished product but this was simply the 4x game i was looking for at the time and there are some reasons why it stands apart from other 4x s at the moment and why you might want to think about getting it unit customisation in gc3 you make military decisions from your technology choices through to the artistic choices you make for your units do you want lasers rail guns missles armor plating shields are you going to have terran looking cruisers or the most alien creations you can imagine i had a truely fun time every opportunity i had to design a new ship star bases probably one of my favourite aspects of gc3 were the use of star bases having extra things to throw resources at when a planet has filled its current building possibilities was great and i think is missing from other 4x games there are though many finishing touches to be made to gc3 but with The_Community around it the mod s that will come should make this game the 4x in space game every one has been waiting for jump in and have a play you would be hard pressed to be disapointed"
The_Community,"alright i ll be completely honest here i had a lot of faith in this game when i bought it the constant updates every day or so The_Community etc until about a month or two after when updates basically halted to once every three weeks and with every update that brought content or fixes another bug would arise this game is great in it s concept however leaving a game that has it s whole back story influence to a russian guy is like letting an indian direct a movie about the american civil war it makes no sense whatsoever this game had so much potential for growth however it looks to be just a cash grab for the dev as he seems to be focused on making another game and it looks to be that he is pretty much porting stuff from that game and putting it in dsj honestly buy it if you ve got the dosh to spare but don t expect much"
Portal,"who knew that a game that classified as an open world space sim could be scarier than all of the fnaf games combined anyway onto the story after many legal trading missions with low reward i decided to do just one illegal mission it was to take 4 slaves to the neibouring system easy enough the first halve was simple as i flew close to full speed out of the station and jumped into hyper space how hard could it be i thought to myself out of hyper space and heading to the starport then out of the corner of my eye i see a direct message from a federation navy ship telling me that i was a suspect and will intredict me at that point my heart was already in my mouth and the other ship about to pull me out of supercruise i finally pulled myself together and managed to line up with the escape vector still in supercruise and the navy ship is still after me the interdiction was easier this time the navy ship left me alone untill an enemy tried to intredict me and succeeded i thought i was as dead as the companion cube in Portal but somehow he didn t want to fight this newbie and left me alone the rest was a breese as i docked the ship and spammed the starport services button to recived my pay 13 12 would get this lucky again"

Team_Fortress_2,"a free game with mechs awsome hawken is one of those games you find mechs in it cool but when you start to play it you will be greated with the sight of pure fantastic visuals and fred fred is the name of your first mech as soon as you start to play you will start to go through the ranks earning many valuable and weird items along the way this game deserves to be not only on steam but many other sites aswell it may take some time to get into but when you do you will love it 6 multiplayer modes 1 mode to explore maps and 2 co op modes bot survival and co op battles the game has plenty to offer and will likely become a game nearly as popular as Team_Fortress_2 this game deserves to be played try it out you might just find yourself in a armour plaited flak cannon and rocket launcher mech you never know till you try"

Terraria,"hurr durr Terraria no really its a good game"
Evolve,"this is a really fun game packed with action and suspense Evolve consisit of 5 classes my favourite is trapper so i highly recomend this game"
Dota_2,"Dota_2 is a fun rage inducing game that requires imo around 50 hrs to grasp the idea and mechanics of the game with over 100 characters to learn master and build to the situation the game offers endless possibilities with a skill bracket ranging from complete and utter n00bs to that of professional players beware though you can be sucked into the game and possibly ruin your life RIRE"
The_Community,"ridiculously fun game spells are powerful but defenses are equally powerful so it s always a matter of out thinking and out playing your opponent the best part is the decision to exclude a mana system so there s not really any micro management going on the developers really listen to The_Community and are very public with what they are working on and going to work on"

Half_Life_2,"how to describe this source mod of Half_Life_2 well first it s quite a unique game one that you don t see too often anymore purely atmospheric with some very appealing lighting and graphics there is little to no music in the game leaving you walking through a quiet and somewhat eerie area even so this sets a perfect atmosphere calmly yet it still keeps you on your nerves admittedly the story is somewhat cliche but is still portrayed quite well as you progress through new areas you meet a few new people who give you small tasks that help you towards getting off of the stranded island you are on with an unknown company blocking any outer communication these characters are not always friendly some attempting to kill you just trying to survive in this perilous land the voice actors are brilliant bringing life to the game and to the characters they play the graphics in this game are while not perfect and somewhat buggy still quite beautiful there were multiple occasions where i would sit there for a few minutes and gaze out into the virtual horizon taking in the quiet beauty the lighting used in the maps are just worthy of a comment in itself dark areas have a dark glow to them while the happier lighter areas have a nice bright tinge to them the infected are somewhat bland looking as though they came from star trek and just have glowing yellow eyes but they don t pose a threat they are more there to remind you of the reason that you are there as a total game i found this to be quite impressive i highly recommend this game to those with a passion for atmosphere considering this was made with the hl2 engine and is only the first act of many to come i can only wait in anticipation for the next few acts this game has impressed me quite a lot with it unique atmosphere and dramatic music as a total this game brings back what was missing in the gaming community atmosphere modern games incorperate as much action as they can sometimes not letting you take a break and take it all in but this game let s you play and take it in at the same time very impressed with this game can t wait for the next acts"

Dont_Starve,"it is a great game i suggest getting it it might just be me but i am completly addicted to this game i think it could be improved by being able to create your own chracter and and build a base settlement as i think it kinda suits the game i think if there where more npcs quests and a choce feature being able to change the main story just a bit i think that it would be a bit better but all these suggestions are what i would like to be implemented to the game but over all i think its a fun game in which you could have alot of fun with friends or on your own forever alone in my opinion it is a realy good game but that is my opinion it wasnt as hardcore survivail that i would like it to be there is water food items every where its good if you just want to play it casual but not the best game if you want to play hardcore chuck norris style over all i play alot of zombie games like dayz deadrising dead island state of decay and left 4 dead but also a lot of survival games like rust Dont_Starve and neather and overall i give it 7 10 freedom 8 10 survival 8 10 graphics 7 10 story 9 10 awesomeness"

Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"now before i begin i haven t played either of the two dlcs that add a couple extra missions recently during the christmas sale i purchased xcom enemy unknown and proceeded to play the living crap out of that game pretty much making it rule my christmas a few days later i saw this game on my queue and decided to go ahead and buy it the bureau xcom declassified not only has a hard name to spell but is also a great game for a prequel to enemy unknown and the general xcom franchise for the casual gamer such as myself this game provides quick medium length missions which are generally 20 40 minutes meaning i dont get stuck for hours in game like i do for say civilizations v or Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive if you re looking for a casual game that includes a very well made squad command system that s not star wars republic commando seriously check it out its amazing and you don t mind the third person perspective then this game is for you be warned this game is not an xcom game quite far from it it s a well made and fairly challenging prequel to eu i ve been playing on normal but from what i ve gathered via others veteran mode is a fairly difficult challenge originally you will have some fps issues if you ve got a toaster like myself set a couple of the graphics settings to medium or low and you ll be hitting 60 fps in no time some of the early levels during this game are retrieve this or save him etc but the mid to late stages of this game make it well worth it the combat is relatively annoying at first especially when you face the spoilers sorry 3 for strategies tactics i ve mainly relied on the scout commando classes due to their abilities being useful no matter where they are on the map pros nicely paced game that doesn t stray too far from what we know and love about xcom agent carter s hat is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing amazing if it gets knocked off you can even hit e on it to pick it back up amazing fits in well with the enemy unknown timeline in certain places i ll come back to this later nice combat mechanics and the alien ai really knows what their doing set in the 60 s how many alien games are set during the cold war vietnam war era squads can be trained up to reach high levels and you can collect alien equipment to arm them the hat cons storyline for me so far can be a bit clunky some fragments of the storyline dont fit with enemy unknown total campaign is estimated at probably 10hrs of gameplay for a casual gamer but this comes to personal preferance squad commands are a bit hard to get used to can t keep agent carters hat on for the whole game storyline issues slight spoler warning while i do recognize that the xcom saga hasn t been known for its whole lore shizzle whizzle some things don t add up during the events of xcom enemy unknown it is stated by dr vahlen that they have never seen these aliens before hang on a sec this is set in the 60 s while eu was in 2015 i realise that firaxis 2k may not have anticipated that this game would overide their original script for eu during enemy unknown we must also research plasma and laser technology however i can bring home weaponry that includes both laser and plasma based weaponry to conduct research overall this game started out fairly well with me but after a while it came out brilliantly the story revolving around the main character is a bit clunky and doesnt make sense with eu and ew however i d reccomend this game to the casual competitive diehard xcom gamer who wants a 3rd person tactical game that has the backing of a major developer such as 2k overall rating 7 10thank you for reading this if you stayed this far i ve been considering starting a curator page yt channel so let me know what you think p s muton elites will literally destroy you unless you spam the living heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out of it"
Tf2,"it s quite sad that i ve had to come to writing this review i ve invested 600 hours of my life into this game yet i am still terrible no matter what class i play Tf2 has been a great ride i was late to the game arriving to steam in early 2015 obviously as most people do i picked up Tf2 first being a console player at the time i was amazed at the game being free i played about 6 hours all at once when i first played and was addicted i played like that for 1 whole year obsessed then suddenly in late 2015 i think gun mettle happened this changed up the game alot with a bunch of up and downsides although i loved the new map suijin they cs go ified Tf2 a little although i didn t care and continued playing the game the next major update was tough break which in my opinion wrecked the game nevertheless i kept on playing having fun on pubs pubs valve servers in this very recent update valve removed valve servers and replaced them with casual mode it isn t very casual though as it s a big hassle trying to get into a game and it doesnt let you pick your own game i like to pick a game with low latency and about 20 people playing i like the new hud but casual is trying way too hard to be competitive recently i have decided to quit Tf2 this is an extremely sad thing for me to do but i no longer find this game enjoyable i do not recommend this game to my fellow steam users thank you for reading my review on the game team fortress 2"

The_Community,"this game has a lot of room to grow what with its short playtime and whatnot however the gameplay is particularly fun and engaging and the game comes with a level editor that enables The_Community to build their own content for the game my hope is that in the future the game will be even more moddable which would make it even more expansive and fun"
Well_There,"the reason why i like this Well_There are many buying this game is like buying a seed it s cheap it grows and branches of into different fruits thats all of the games and minigames i definitley reccomend and i hopped this helped"
The_Community,"this game is horrible and full of cheats every server i went to there were players flying in mid air hovering around in mid air and one shot killing me and other players even with both anti cheats systems in place lots of people still hack in this game which makes the game unplayable and unenjoyable a typical run in rust begins with you running for 2 minutes then being head shotted or instantly killed by a fellow player this is what happens 90 per cent of the time to players who don t hack while the cheats can do as they please because they are armed to the teeth The_Community in this game is a joke more like a community of trolls and angry children which most people just kill you for the hell of it there is no team work or friendly people to build alliances with in this game and it in the end becomes a battle between you and the hackers hacker groups which you don t stand a chance to sum this game up is to say that it is a run and get gunned down simulator unless of cause you use hacks don t waste your money on this crap game it will be 20 dollars down the drain"
Half_Life_2,"i m really enjoying the game but let me get something straight this game just isn t for everyone it s hard people kill you monsters kill you either way someone will probably loot your corpse and take all your stuff i really enjoy it like that also i don t think you can get a house unless you sub but i really don t think that it is that bad look at world of warcraft they have the same cost subscription but you also have to spend alot just buying the game for somethng that repetitive my stat side of the reviewgraphics 6 10 it s better than half life but not as good as Half_Life_2 graphics gameplay 9 10 it plays alot like mount blade and there is just so much freedom community 8 10 only thing that annoys me about the community are the people who heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit about it like i said it doesn t suit everyone if you don t like it don t heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit about it to everyone who likes it just log off and go play something else crafting 7 10 i like the crafting but i think it can look a little hard when you first start overall i give this game 8 10"

Tf2,"i m so sick of all the kids who download this game to get the free Tf2 hat and say the achievement doesn t work and just leaves a bad review if you have nothing good to say then get out of this community because that is the cancer of spiral knights this game is just a simple dungeon crawler game with a lot of good mechanics it might be irritating to play but when you reach a high rank and you find the item that you need you feel happy inside i suggest actually giving this game a try i have been playing this game from 2013 2016 i quit for two years and i always loved the game i didn t quit because i was bored i quit because i didn t have any time i highly suggest this game to someone who has a lot of time"

Half_Life_2,"although it only has 4 maps this game has a lot of potential remember it is still in alpha and future updates are coming soon this game runs the source engine which also run gmod and Half_Life_2 and also originally a Half_Life_2 mod like gmod i see great things for this game although it has its flaws it is still good i suggest leveling up adding more maps and ability to change your guns and customize equipment 9 5 10"
Tf2,"after playing hours and hours of the old ace of spades see buildandshoot com i bought this game with high anticipation and excitement sure this game is a minecraft Tf2 inspired fps combat that feels relatively new in a genre that is completely overrated it s fast paced combat certainly sets it away from a crowded fps genre and its zombie mode is surprisingly the best mode in terms of balance and fun another positive is that it offers map editing and the ability to share custom maps sadly each of ace of spades four classes certainly have their pros and cons which significantly imbalance the game depending on gamemode for example the rocketeer jetpacks across the map with an smg in capture the flag which seems unforgivably lopsided furthermore the minecraft building aspect seems untouched and is hardly used which is also hampered by a bugged reticule"
Tf2,"awesome game to me loadout is an extremely customisable version of Tf2 with a bit more cartoon blood just like borderlands 2 the range of weapon and character customisation isenormous and the fact all weapon customisation options are available to all people is amazing gameplay is fun and very fast paced making for quick and exciting combat that is excellent esoecially for casual gamers only down sides are that character customisation costs unless you get items through daily prize and sadly it is difficult at times to find an active match of humans vs humans apart from these loadout is a fantastic game many of you should try 7 5 10 very good"

The_Community,"the best word to describe verdun would be brutal but in a very very good way overall opinion fantastic historical a damn good game and well worth the price if it s on sale it s a must verdun one of the most historically acurrate games i ve ever played from being hit by gas attacks to being shot mid stride and watching your body slump down into the mud and battling it out in trench warfare on some of wwi most know battlegrounds most weapons are extremly satisfying to use with most rifles downing a charging enemy or and entreched one in one shot pistols maybe taking 2 shots on average but having the advantage of being semi automatic making pistols extremly formidable even at long range this game will make you work espically in the trench warfare mode where this game comes into its own you will push up to cover or the enemy trench most likely die in the process but you know you ll do it again because there is that chance you will make it into that cover or arrive into the enemy trench bayonet at the ready verdun succeeds in creating a very tense atmosphere from merly lying in no man s land waiting for your squad or slowly creeping through the enemy trench knowing that your probably going to get shot from behind you and your team will have to rtry and detremine which part of the enemy trench is the least defended or create a space for your team mates to enter the teams i have played on usually worked together i havent really noticed much toxicity which is a postive thing and i hope it stays that way although it can be daunting for new players as getting shot from seemingly no where can be frustrating and not hitting your mark on long shots because you werent compenstating for bullet drop and travel time can be slightly most players will pick things up like compesation and not standing straight up at the edge of your trench or in the middle of no man s land overall this is a history buffs wet dream and damn good shooter very solid for an early access game although its missing a few minor things i d love to see them add more battlefields and more forces like gallipoli which would hopefully cause the dev s to add the anzac forces to the game for which the australian and new zerland members of The_Community would be very grateful for also the addition of more blood and gore would add to the already fantastic immersion i m sure the dec s will continue to polish and improve this game and i cant wait to see what it becomes"

Tf2,"this game is very uumm how do i say interesting this is a extremely fun game to play with your friends it allows you to be creative and to troll your friends with that creativity garry s mod is a limitless game it allows you to do stuff even minecraft can t do although there are those people online who take some stuff too seriously unlike Tf2 check it out that is why it is better to play with your friends but playing online with other people is not so bad"
Tf2,"this game is unique it is like bringing a mmorpg to a fps game and it is amazing the way valve design this game is brilliant every class and weapon has it s own strength and weaknesses plus adding things such as taunts and hats makes it more fun and hilarious but the most amazing thing about Tf2 is that you can be an idiot or a fool and no one will get mad even sometimes people will be a idiot with you it is a game nothing like coc or rift it is a legit fun game where you can laugh your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off and never get bored especially with friends i highly recommend it"
Dota_2,"awesomenauts is a fascinating game i mean come on a 2d moba shouldn t be good but it is awesomenauts flawlessly combines a platformer with the moba genre the game is balanced a lot better than Dota_2 or RIRE it has an easy to use interface is highly accessible and always action packed this game simply put is outstanding for a moba 8 5 10"
Dota_2,"ah valve why do you torment us so Dota_2 is a moba as many people would probably know due to this game being the most played on steam Dota_2 is a solid game and i would say due to the nature of the game s genre being a rather unpopulated market the best one in the moba genre i say this for a couple of reasons but i will list those later Dota_2 stills holds much to warcraft 3 the game it was based off of now Dota_2 attracts me for a few reasons those being it s very simple but effective party or solo play the potential profit that is able to be made and of course my affnity for strategy games being a free to play game Dota_2 is amazing valve did a brilliant job n it and altough things could be improved in some areas it is still a perfect example of what valve is capable of pros excellent combat variety of heroes variety of items excellent party system gripping game that has the potential to reach high tension when victory is unclear level system works well purchaseable items are only for cosmetic effect keeping the game balanced potential gold mine for economically minded playerscons some broken heroes matchmaking they ll never get it right community is mean to newcomers tutorial is boring and does little to encourage playverdict 9 10 one of my favourite games on steam if they just fixed up the minor things wrong with the game itself it would be more deserving of a better rating"
The_Community,"it s about time i reviewed this game europa universalis iv is simply amazing i pour a lot of my extra time into this game and are never disappointed with the game the newest update to euiv added a lot of new features for free something that is rare in this age of gaming developer support simply the best i ve seen in years paradox are one of the few companies that don t milk their customers for money and actually listen and respond to The_Community euiv is updated regularly and every now and then a massive update comes out even though this game has an incessant amount of dlc don t allow that to throw you off unlike the civilization franchise of late you need no dlc to enjoy this game much of the dlc is for a more in depth experience and reminds me of a crowdfunding system graphics the graphics of euiv aren t going to win any awards anytime soon but they fit the game and it s genre most of the graphical elements within euiv is the map itself and there is decent detail for this military units naval and army are rather generic and bland and this is where the main clump of dlc comes in most of the dlc are visual enhancements to the game adding varied unit appearances in terms of the gui i personally love it the gui without any menus up is rather spartan but provides all nescessary information to the player with menus however is where euiv shines the menus are complex and indepth easy to navigate and sometimes a bit unclear difficulty i ll say it now if you have no patience you are probably not going to like euiv the game has a steep learning curve in comparison to most strategy games and that can be accredited to the game sitting by itself in it s own subdivison on strategy it is neither and rts or tb but rather an rts that is pauseable ruining the entire purpose of an rts to new players menus can be confusing and war may be a major attractor to new players personally i say learn the menus first then unpause the game gameplay gameplay in euiv can be boring if you let it be most of the time the game attempts to keep you involved with events and issues around your country i ve had a friend turn away from this game due to them not bothering to learn the menus and hopping right in as sweden then he immediately declared war on his overlord not pretty war is painful in this game to conduct properly and to be honest it is extremely hard to play as a non european civilisation once the colonial countries come all in all euiv is worth every dollar with an excellent developer who supports their game and listens to The_Community and an invloving behemoth of a game it is truly worth the 40 i payed"

Dota_2,"Dota_2 has been the most addicting game i ve played till now besides for minecraft i ve played around 100 games although not many i ve been playing with a lot of heroes the only problem i ve seen is that some hero is really annoying especially rikimaru rikimaru can be countered with wards dust gem and really squishy in early game but in low ranked games people dont know that they usually just stay there getting xp and then when riki blinked strike them they run away and let riki get fat i really suggest nerfing riki a little bit early game just to make him really squishy make him not and easy hero too nerf his skill a little bit so people dont always win after getting a fat riki overall this game is awesome i seriously recommend it for you people"

The_Community,"i have noticed in the review section of this game that a lot of people are giving this game more of a negative rating rather than positive which is quite frankly true pre patch 1 37 7 8 10patch1 37 10patch 1 37 was supposedly to make the game better in the way it was more balance RIRE infact it made it worse throught my few hours playing the game after patch 1 37 i have come to believe that gaijan have become greedy like activision treyarch in the ye old days like 1 29 you could quite easly come out of a match making around 10 20k profit depending on whether you have premium or not i not saying this because im bad but here are 3 reasons why gaijin had screwed up the game after patch 1 37 1 matchmaking after 10 games in the new patch im not sure if it was unlucky or absoluty garbage i prefer to play in the british line up while using stuff like the wellington beaufighters ect the problem i was having is i would get over the bombing target in my wellington ic and then be killed by 8 fighters who can climb to your altitude within a matter of minutes which resulting into easy kills aircraft have now been sorted in tiers rather than ranks you may think that is true but infact its the complete opposite the aircraft may be a tier 3 but the battle rating which can be found while hovering over the aircraft is the acctually ranked lobby you will be put in for example the mustang mk1a which is a british fighter is a tier 4 but its battle rating is 5 3 they say they would be changing this but can we really believe them 2 leveling up prier to patch 1 37 if the people who are reading this just started you had ranks rather than tiers like any game you get kills lions xp more aircraft kills which was all good you could quite happly level up now you need to research the aircraft the developers said this new system would acctually help you unlock aircraft quicker wrong infact it would take you 4 5x long to get a single plane in the game for example the f80c shooting star you need 3200rp to unlock if you get an average of 1 3k rp for that aircraft note not all rp earned in a game goes towards an aircraft the rest is stored so you can use it later but there is a twist it would take you atleast 100 150 games to unlock and a normal game goes for 20 mins 20x150 3 100 24 41 so it would take you around 1 2 days of non stop gameplay to unlock it lies 3 pay to play as this person has explained beautifully on the war thunder forums so let me sum up it here instead of playing and enjoying the game gaijin wants the players to 1 buy gold 2 buy premium 3 play the game a lot 4 realize you can t do it without premium aircraft buy premium aircraft 5 lose your xx on repair bills because you can t use your fully upgraded lower planes for higher level plane research xp 6 use your golden eagles to buy lions at exorbitant rates 7 rinse and repeat stop locking these threads people need to know what gaijin did stop censoring the threads mods your job is not censor the posts of the paying members and communities response we all know the mods are purposely locking these threads trying to downplay The_Community response to this patch which is designed for one reason and one reason only to make the game take much longer and force a whole lot more golden eagle purchases we are not stupid we can see right through you digital zombielink http forum warthunder com index php topic 89224 research really as you can see gaijin have become so full of themselfs they cant control what they have become without starting over many people would agree that dont waste your time on this game till they get there heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit together regards shifty"
Portal,"i really am not sure what to think of Portal 2 the charm of the first is lost though this doesn t make it a bad game at its core Portal 2 is a simple puzzler in an fps shell and offers a great distraction to more indepth games its definately not half life type awesomeness and i guess you need to expect that though i would sacrifice both Portal games for another entry into the half life universe i will put this just under bejewelled in regards to great puzzlers 70 100"

Tf2,"when i first got this game i spend about 100 hours getting skills and getting ready to take on online people and pros this time was well spent as i was playing so much better than some players that went directly to multiplayer for new players offline bots do help a lot now i was up to the stage where i felt that i needed that paid to play ptp so i went ahead and got it the second i got that ptp it opened up so much more of Tf2 than what it was like before ptp however after finding my first hat ptp Tf2 players will find that Tf2 was almost a man s dressup game or as most people would call it now a hat simulator as ptp it is important that you don t get fustrated when you don t get stuff you want even though you find items about 15 50 faster than free to play ftp users then it happens again but this time you unboxed your first unusal everything changes again and the game becomes much more exiting i found that most players that have unusals kind of going to use a common ftp reference like to train and become better at that specific class as ftp you will see peeople wearing those unusals and become either jealous fustrated that they are so good and sometimes call them hackers and who knows maybe they are hacking but overall you can worry about how good you look but just look good in those freeze cam and show how good looking you are but that shouldn t stop you actuly being a ftp and playing the game even though you are ptp lastly what you should note about Tf2 is that it isn t repetive like some games like neverwinter etc there is always going to be new players with new styles of gameplay that makes this game very interesting too reguard less if they are ptp or ftp my final thoughts this game is great also makes a good time killer if you have some spare time on your hands this game can keep you hooked for hours on hand and as ptp you do a lot of trading so sometimes is good to watchout for scamers or people in high demand for something in addtion this game is extreamly good looking as well in both gameplay and graphics Tf2 is going to be a hard one to beat 9 10"

Metro_2033,"long story short a run of the mill modern military shooter with a meaningless and short single player campaign while neat with graphics and sound the 15 seems a bit too much on a rather easy and generic 6 hour game pass it unless you re very interested disclaimer while i haven t played the sequel yet metro last light i ve heard a lot of the narrative is improved upon with that game i have also not played the redux versions as of yet Metro_2033 is a first person shooter that takes place in the tunnels of moscow in the somewhat distant future you play as artyom a dude who is trying to get to the other side of the subway to save his hometown from mutants on the way you encounter bandits creatures and a strange supernatural entity while the goal of the single player is made clear from the start it quickly loses track as you meet up with other characters and basically go through escort like areas with them it s hard to keep focused when you re constantly meeting different people and experience different kinds of gameplay for example one moment you re fending off a minecart from mutants the next you re sneaking through a bandit hideout stealthily killing each person you find the next you re walking down a corridor talking to a guy with very little coming at you each with some different npc leading you the whole journey feels disjointed and inconsistent throughout the game you acquire a bunch of weapons most of these function a bit differently but some just seem outright pointless like the ball bearing shooter which can barely even damage enemies runs out of ammo quickly and occupies the same slot as the shotguns my biggest issue with the weapons is that there s very little variety there s nothing past pistols assault rifles and shotguns these weapons can be found on the ground alongside medkits which quickly restore your health and gasmasks which basically are a time meter for above ground sections my issue with the medkits is that the game is a cover based shooter where all of your health eventually regenerates in gunfights with other humans medkits are only there to save time rather than hiding behind cover in fights with mutants medkits are pointless as the regenerating health mechanic pretty much saves you from any hits that the mutants do provided you dodge their attacks a bit all of these items are also sold in shop areas which appear in the first half of the game they oddly never appear again after chapter 4 i believe an interesting concept here is that bullets are the currency of the game my issue with this is that the kind of bullets that are used as currency are also the weakest bullets which removes the whole purpose of them so the gameplay has you going through a bunch of different locations meeting a few different kinds of enemies you ll fight humans who all hitscan you if you move out of cover the gameplay for these guys is pretty generic and bland while their ai is good in moving into cover and such there s just no variety between them throughout the game the other kinds of enemies are the mutants there s a few different kinds but they all can only melee attack you making running backwards in circles and firing wildly an unfortunately effective method these enemies also deal a surprisingly low amount of damage even on harder difficulties making them very easy and nonthreatening targets which is a shame as they re supposedly the huge threat of the story there s also a few stealth sections in the game artyom s watch has a coloured light section that indicates how well seen you are but at least for me it doesn t work all that well there s been times where i ve hit the red light and have still been able to run through unnoticed other times the light is green and i start getting shot at stealth is a very weak element of the game and fortunately or unfortunately it only comes up three times in the game of course there s a lot of on rails sections where you re on some sort of moving vehicle and you re shooting at stuff these vary the story up a bit but in general are a bit easier than the rest of the game and lack the depth or challenge that you d be expecting during these usually explosive sequences i don t know if it s just me but i experienced a lot of bugs with the game there s the above stealth system which sometimes doesn t indicate the right thing i ve had ai glitch up and run into walls constantly i ve had times where a scripted sequence at the beginning of the game ended to my death i ve had times where the ui would not come up the worst one i had though was that my gas mask would not come off my face which was okay at first however with the gas mask taking damage starts to crack the visor making it extremely difficult to see and since i couldn t take it off i was forced to play through literally half the game with my screen almost obscured loading a save or checkpoint wouldn t fix it graphically the game looks alright depth of field and fancy lighting and particle effects makes the tunnels and overground look starkly different the sound is also done alright the music builds up at the right times although it s pretty generic and the sound design works well as sounds echo in the tunnels and fade off in the overground sections unfortunately the engine can not make up for the game s shortcomings Metro_2033 was not that enjoyable for me i played through the game twice once on hard and once on ranger hard which hides the ui and makes everything including you die very quickly both playthroughs were plagued with issues for me i didn t enjoy the game that much mainly because it was short and didn t offer anything substantial in terms of gameplay and that s a shame because my friends tell me there s a great story tucked away underneath it all it s just i was too focused on the gameplay to really experience that there s a couple of side things to collect and there s a second ending that isn t purely a decision at the end of the game but especially the ending i felt that the game was giving me mixed messages about who was the good guy in the story which would be fine if it was a bit more clear cut what the implications of my decisions were Metro_2033 is a modern military shooter first and foremost if you like those kinds of games you may find something good here the setting is unique and ultimately you might have a good time with it however if you like me don t like those kinds of games pass on Metro_2033 as it won t do anything that amazing to interest you rating 0 up 1 downmy up down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre less ups and downs total and games that are interesting but flawed more ups and downs totals ups relate to how much good a game has and downs are how much bad a game has 0 ups 1 ups 2 ups 3 ups not worth playing skip it alright play it if you re into the genre very good play it if you re looking for something worth trying one to go down in history a must have for everyone table 0 downs 1 downs 2 downs 3 downs nothing detrimental in the game a few things wrong but doesn t ruin it kind of broken or aggravating you may not be able to put up with it very very broken a lesson on what not to do table"

in the first half of the game they oddly never appear again after chapter 4 i believe an interesting concept here is that bullets are the currency of the game my issue with this is that the kind of bullets that are used as currency are also the weakest bullets which removes the whole purpose of them so the gameplay has you going through a bunch of different locations meeting a few different kinds of enemies you ll fight humans who all hitscan you if you move out of cover the gameplay for these guys is pretty generic and bland while their ai is good in moving into cover and such there s just no variety between them throughout the game the other kinds of enemies are the mutants there s a few different kinds but they all can only melee attack you making running backwards in circles and firing wildly an unfortunately effective method these enemies also deal a surprisingly low amount of damage even on harder difficulties making them very easy and nonthreatening targets which is a shame as they re supposedly the huge threat of the story there s also a few stealth sections in the game artyom s watch has a coloured light section that indicates how well seen you are but at least for me it doesn t work all that Well_There s been times where i ve hit the red light and have still been able to run through unnoticed other times the light is green and i start getting shot at stealth is a very weak element of the game and fortunately or unfortunately it only comes up three times in the game of course there s a lot of on rails sections where you re on some sort of moving vehicle and you re shooting at stuff these vary the story up a bit but in general are a bit easier than the rest of the game and lack the depth or challenge that you d be expecting during these usually explosive sequences i don t know if it s just me but i experienced a lot of bugs with the game there s the above stealth system which sometimes doesn t indicate the right thing i ve had ai glitch up and run into walls constantly i ve had times where a scripted sequence at the beginning of the game ended to my death i ve had times where the ui would not come up the worst one i had though was that my gas mask would not come off my face which was okay at first however with the gas mask taking damage starts to crack the visor making it extremely difficult to see and since i couldn t take it off i was forced to play through literally half the game with my screen almost obscured loading a save or checkpoint wouldn t fix it graphically the game looks alright depth of field and fancy lighting and particle effects makes the tunnels and overground look starkly different the sound is also done alright the music builds up at the right times although it s pretty generic and the sound design works well as sounds echo in the tunnels and fade off in the overground sections unfortunately the engine can not make up for the game s shortcomings Metro_2033 was not that enjoyable for me i played through the game twice once on hard and once on ranger hard which hides the ui and makes everything including you die very quickly both playthroughs were plagued with issues for me i didn t enjoy the game that much mainly because it was short and didn t offer anything substantial in terms of gameplay and that s a shame because my friends tell me there s a great story tucked away underneath it all it s just i was too focused on the gameplay to really experience that there s a couple of side things to collect and there s a second ending that isn t purely a decision at the end of the game but especially the ending i felt that the game was giving me mixed messages about who was the good guy in the story which would be fine if it was a bit more clear cut what the implications of my decisions were Metro_2033 is a modern military shooter first and foremost if you like those kinds of games you may find something good here the setting is unique and ultimately you might have a good time with it however if you like me don t like those kinds of games pass on Metro_2033 as it won t do anything that amazing to interest you rating 0 up 1 downmy up down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre less ups and downs total and games that are interesting but flawed more ups and downs totals ups relate to how much good a game has and downs are how much bad a game has 0 ups 1 ups 2 ups 3 ups not worth playing skip it alright play it if you re into the genre very good play it if you re looking for something worth trying one to go down in history a must have for everyone table 0 downs 1 downs 2 downs 3 downs nothing detrimental in the game a few things wrong but doesn t ruin it kind of broken or aggravating you may not be able to put up with it very very broken a lesson on what not to do table"

The_Community,"this game is incredible fun challenging hilarious at times and overall a pleasure for people thinking of buying this game keep in mind this game is still in alpha there is a lot of optomization to be done still a lot of content to come and of course a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ton of bugs that said you will not regret this buy another piece of advice to new players official servers are an absolute grind with multi hours tames for some of the most basic dinos play on an unofficial server i d reccomend 5x tame and gather it s not too much not too little you have the choice of pve and pvp offline raiding is a massive thing if you want to pvp prepare to wake up to find your stuff destroyed time and time again play in a tribe if possible solo is hard and you can not learn to build everything by yourself an intended feature low end pc s you can still run this game but you will likely run it between 10 25 fps on low settings still a beautiful game despite this lastly the dev team are amazing The_Community representation and response is nothing short of incredible these guys care about their player base they want to make the best game they can and they re constantly taking advice from the player base whether it be tiny things that make ark that little bit better or massive changes the devs listen and care quite often ideas and suggestions from the ark community have made it into the game"
Team_Fortress_2,"i find it halarious that this game lets you build anything at all from your imagination if you can afford it p enormous freedom to make anything and you literally about to build then you freeze realising you have no idea what to build the game lets yo make anything you want to kill players around the world with their designs and live to tell the tale the game makes you stressed when you re under fire from that one smg tank and you re worried about dying then a majestic plazma bomber saves you you regenerate from the helpful medic and heals you for the rest of the match and kill everything like a medic and heavy from Team_Fortress_2 the amount of weapons is helpful with missles smgs plazma launchers railguns aa guns and mediguns each weapon makes you play differently for every moment like railguns you need to be hidden and efficiant with shots however smg s you re going up close and doing as much damage to people as possible 10 10 would recommend for creative intelligent people with the ability to think under pressure"

Portal,"if you come into this game expecting orcs must die 3 or something like RIRE or dota than your going to be dissapointed that doesn t mean this game is bad by all means it s a great game the general gameplay of seige mode pvp is really fun the trap building is very cut down to a basic form compared to the other orcs must die games but adds a level of strategy to dealing with incoming waves this is understandable as your focus is on this push hold gameplay style but to ultimately break through the other team s rift room jungeling in this is not really a thing it s destroying caches and getting minion Portal upgrades which is essential to win and doing this playstyle means you need to know when to support your team during pushes survival mode is the pve gamemode where you defend your rift against waves of enemy minions this mode feels lacking especially if you ve played the other orcs must die games most of the time if your team isn t dumb or your down a player you will win games don t feel long enough or are not difficult once you ve figured out how to force minions the long way survival does need improvements and hopefully later in development it gets better not saying it s not enjoyable just that gets bland after a 3 5 games in one play session free to play means pay to win right no sure you can get a boost from paying for heros and chests but doesn t mean that if you don t buy you will have to grind to be good at the game the grind isn t too bad for traps and minions which determine your strategy of winning however for heros and other things will take longer to obtain in my opinion buying the calssic hero pack is not worth it and the grind for them is find for free to plays"
Tf2,"this game this game this game has brought numerous gamers countless hours of fun and procrastination this game may not bring much to the table in terms of gameplay and it may come across as a childish and perhaps overrated game and maybe just maybe you re right but let me tell you what has been told a million times before this game is ridiculously fun seriously no money to hand over no advertisements and you start with a fair bit for a f2p game this is singlehandedly the best multiplayer game i have ever played from it s ever expanding community do it s deep roots with the past to it s ever changing gameplay this game is amazing not only that but the openness of the game must truely push the source engine to the limit i m going to stop ranting now do you have 15 ish gb of internet to spare on a game that will stay alive for years to come you do then get the game all those pictures of spycrabs and rapping demomen will make so much more sense when you actually start playing edit i have just gone through the negative section and 90 of the negative posts go something along these lines Tf2 has hats hats ruined game seriously if you don t like trading are tired of getting scammed think the trading community is bad then guess what don t trade hats aren t an integral part of Tf2 i ve met many good players who wear gibus for the sake of getting surprise kills there are three types of people who play Tf2 the players the traders and the mvmers please invest in them all it s a good learning experience heck when you become and experienced player you can help other new players but please if you do find a reason good enough to drop the game comment it below i would love to hear it 3"

The_Community,"ok i noticed that there are alot of reviews saying that the developer jens isnt really talking to The_Community about this game and isnt updating it at all i would like to say thats not true at least not now if you follow the blockscape website and facebook page you will get updates every so often of what jens is working on now as far as the game goes its quite good for the current stage its in it has some very pretty graphics and has pretty good building mechanics aswell however they could still be worked upon but this game is at least i think is worth supporting i dont regret purchasing it edit again i have seen even more people say that the dev does not update The_Community about what he is working on although i can forgive this as it might be hard to find the devlog for some people http ww blockscape com v2 devlog there is the devlog he is updating quite frequently on what he is trying to acheve and what he has accomplished the extremely infrequent updates are making it seem like no progress is being made on the game however i believe that the dev is waiting until he has developed enough content to then release a decent update for the game as you can see in the devlog he is most certainly working on things my view on the game has not changed as of late oh i should also mention it is only one man working on the game 2nd edit well a year on and the game has gotten no updates there has been some post made by the dev on the progress of the game so he is working on it and has shown some new screenshots of the game and how it looks now but as of right now i would not by this game i think its potential is honestly extremely high still but the future of the game is pretty uncertain at this point here s hoping it all turns out okay"
Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"what is counter strike source it is a multiplayer first person shooter which is a remake of the original counter strike that focuses on the teams of counter terrorists against terrorists this game includes plenty of maps including some well known maps such as de dust2 with the gamemode of bomb defusal and cs office having the gamemode of hostage rescue this game involves quite a bit of skill unlike other first person shooters out there which can be hard to get used to how it works this game takes quite a bit of skill as said previously it requires knowledge and understanding of the game this can mean learning the economics of the game from nade usage to shooting and compnesating spray control as you progress you will start to learn these things learning is what makes this game longer lasting and more enjoyable than other first person shooters popular gamemodes bomb defusal this is a gamemode with the main objective where the counter terrorists try to prevent the terrorists from planting at either bomb sites a or b there are 2 ways that will give you victory as counter terrorists you can eliminate the enemy team or defuse the bomb before it explodes when playing as terrorist you can win doing the same thing as the counter terrorists which is eliminating the enemy team or planting the bomb and letting it explode hostage rescue a gamemode which has hostages that are placed where the terrorist spawn same concept with the wiping out enemy team but instead of the terrorists objective to plant the bomb it is the counter terrorist to rescue the hostages and take them back to where the counter terrorists spawn custom gamemodes lastly in counter strike source you will be seeing a lot of custom maps and servers which make up majority of the servers nowadays these gamemodes go from minigames to bhop and surf with plenty of other custom gamemodes to chose from custom gamemodes are especially fun to play when you are bored or just looking for something to play with your mates conclusion well worth buying it if it goes on sale a little bit cheaper as it is a little old and not worth the 20 at the moment worth all the 200 hours on this game however there aren t as much servers as they use to be because it is getting old and there are mods that are available which are a load of fun to play such as jailbreak and zombies hands down the best game for its time and maybe even today at least for me i do recommend this game to those who are thinking of purchasing it although you better purchase it soon as servers are getting wiped although if you are still wanting the counter strike experience you can switch over to cs go Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive its a good alternative but i still prefer counter strike source over it9 5 10"

Dota_2,"what can i say after 100 hours i still feel unwelcome in the obnoxious community and still get absolutely stomped but i just can not put this masterpiece down defense of the ancients was a pioneer of the moba genre and it s sequel remains a strong contender with the likes of smite and league of legends Dota_2 offers a pool of over 100 absolutely free heroes and both a casual and competitive approach however you choose to play the game you ll be met with an array of toxic cussing and hateful individuals who will trash talk and rage at you for the simplest mistake a thick skin is necessary to obtain full enjoyment out of Dota_2 ignoring the savage community Dota_2 has perhaps the most engaging entertaing and satisfying gameplay ever it feels amazing to initiate a succesful teamfight or to just win a close game most heroes are balanced meaning most victories are owed to the skills of the players however a keen sense of mechanics knowledge is mandatory due to the game s reliance on different damage types and various other integral factors whilst it can be difficult as a new player persistence and resilience can introduce you to many hours of fun for the best possible experience playing with friends will both save you from hateful people and allow you to synergise your strategies Dota_2 is free so you have nothing to lose from buying it except maybe your social life"

The_Community,"payday 2 puts you and three friends in the role of a criminal gang who steal destroy kill make drugs steal some more and make lots of money doing so some missions are for the sneaky some for the control freaks and yet more for the just plain blood thirsty the missions are short yet engaging the atmosphere fun rather than immersive and the rewards simple more money more guns and more masks yes masks are a thing you would have thought they were just there to hide your face wouldn t you and you would be wrong but don t think about it for now now it should be pointed out that you can solo this game but the ai is pretty bad in loud missions and the game really rewards playing with friends especially on the higher difficulty levels but probably the best thing about this game is The_Community and the development team for the game there are constant updates and new heists new weapons new skills and even new faces some of these will cost you and some are free but in the end for the sheer amount of time i have spent in this game and the fun i have had this game and all its dlc have been superb value for money gopher youtuber livestreamer sums it up well"

Nether,"from the zero punctuation review there have been many rpgs that let you define your character s personality to a certain extent say you re given a quest to get a schoolgirl s cat down from a tree on average you ll be given three options neutral where you get the cat down and accept the schoolgirl s allowance as payment good where you waive the fee and fondly tousle the schoolgirl s hair as she scampers off and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit where you set fire to the tree and jump up and down on the schoolgirl s face and speaking as an heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit this offends me there are so many wonderful ways to be a complete ponce that these games rarely cater for why can t i rescue the cat but hold it to ransom for her dad s porn collection or get the cat down by throwing rocks at it so it breaks all its legs on the concrete and then still expect to be paid with the infuriatingly infallible logic of a complete tosser why can t there be an rpg that covers the entire heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit spectrum well good news ponce fans now there is alpha protocol follows mike thorton a member of a covert u s government agency with strong ties to a private military company that might as well rename itself kitten stranglers plc he gets betrayed goes rogue has to work alone to build a case against them blahdee blahdee blah but what s important is that however you play him mike thorton is the is the ponciest ponce that ever ponced past a poncing parlour the dialogue system lets you switch between three attitudes a professional by the book sort of ponce who wouldn t emote if the angel gabriel blow off in his face an aggressive ponce who sounds like he s five seconds away from snarlingly flipping the global crisis onto its front and pounding away at its Netherhole with a franchi spas 12 and the suave ponce who might as well just save time and mace himself every time he opens his heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing mouth best of all even if he only ever talked about his favorite breakfast cereal he d still sound like a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit because the voice actor delivers every line in the level smug tones of a highbrow film critic archly dismissing the latest superhero blockbuster as he spoons himself another helping of baby seal let s get the good over with quickly for once this is a game that claims that every action has consequences and actually means a consequence more significant than a character maybe wearing a different hat for example although the hub based mission system lets you do the operations in any order during the one i chose to do last an informant mentioned the previous operations i d completed in conversation heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit i said this game s just showing off now so i immediately became an aggressive ponce and slammed his head into a desk after which there was more security in my next mission because the informant went crying to his big brother or something the rpg action stuff reminded me of deus ex in a good way it s nice to see a game where your character has to work on their gun skills and can t expect to draw their pistol and immediately hit the on button on a tumble dryer from nine hundred years and i was also impressed by the lockpicking and hacking minigames which nicely balance skill and incremental difficulty and i can t think of a joke for that sentence so here s a picture of a dog in a hat the thing about deus ex though was that you could arguably specialize completely in combat or stealth or hacking or playing the cello and still beat the game even the final encounter had equal parts monsters security systems and incomplete string quartets to allow any approach alpha protocol on the other hand is happy to let you sink all your points into learning to waltz only to find yourself stuck in an unavoidable freestyle disco competition i was a stealth close combat specialist and there was this particularly obnoxious boss fight that i couldn t sneak out of and whose cqc attacks wrecked my heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit i had to inexpertly spray at him with an assault rifle i knew as much about as i did a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing nuclear reactor then whenever he got his knives out let him chase me around the room like benny heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing hill the skills you can upgrade are stealth hand to hand combat and then four kinds of guns which i feel makes little sense why the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit would anyone specialise in shotguns when a shotgun is a situational weapon what are you gon na do if there s an enemy more than ten feet away throw your shoes at him the dialogue system gives you about one second to pick a conversational attitude that is summed up in one word and it s often hard to decipher you might be talking to a sexy lady for e g when suddenly an option comes up reading say trousers and there s no way of knowing if this means the poncemaster general will change the conversation to the subject of trousers or draw attention to a specific pair of trousers sneaking up behind them or whatever so you select it out of panic whereupon el ponco promptly pulls his trousers down and slaps his bum while mooing like a lost calf spoiling your reputation with the character somewhat dialogue seems a bit buggy at times too which i guess is inevitable with conversation trees as labyrinthine as this there was a moment when i was gabbing away with another sexy lady when the option came up to initiate a quick knobbing which went down reasonably well then afterwards she started repeating dialogue lines she d been spouting beforehand wow i thought i literally heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ed her brain out there are a couple of other bugs here and there like how the distinction between a wall you can take cover on and the ones with ponce repellent wallpaper is known only to mr thorton but none of them got in the way too much because after a while my stealth skill was so high i could literally turn invisible and run around insta killing every possible threat with my bare hands and nothing could pose a challenge after that short of the invention of some kind of ponce seeking missile all in all alpha protocol is weak and poorly balanced like a three legged dog with an eating disorder but i want to come back to the story for a bit you know that extremely brief summary i gave about five paragraphs ago that s literally the extent of the plot i understood the rest was an incomprehensible miasma of factions motivations and betrayals through which i was just dumbly acting with zero understanding towards the end a line of dialogue got drowned out just before a boss encounter and i honestly didn t know if i was supposed to be killing or protecting the guy maybe this would be helped through repeat playthroughs oh sega you crafty heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit es"
The_Community,"payday 2 is easily one of the best multiplayer experiences i ever had i wouldn t call it the most polished game considering the single player aspect of it isn t the best due to the friendly ai s inablility to do much except shoot and move around with friends or without multiplayer gameplay is insanely addictive and amusing however stealth is a bit finicky bugs are quite rampant and The_Community can be quite undesirable"

Evolve,"thank you for this experience spoilers may or may not be implied be warned life is strange is an unusual ride a blend of story and deeper meanings mixed in with some hints of the supernatural themes rEvolve around morality decision making what could have been who should come out on top or whether anyone should at all but most of all it makes you think about basic humanitarian needs and how similar we are in the long run or at least it did for me maxine is a quiet and introverted photographer whom has returned to her home town after five years away as such i can relate to her character in various ways you are presented opportunities to help others at risk to your own safety which is something i personally regret not being able to do in previous scenarios in my own life as such this conflicts with other characters whom may have been threatening the ones you most wished to assist which further reinforces a feeling of loss as they may not deserve your pity but nonetheless are also a person with a personality and dreams which you have helped to hinder or obfuscate in some way in order to help your preferred character episode one goes along a solid path and i will most definitely be purchasing the subsequent episodes as i believe they will make me think and cry as i have with this episode what a work of art i m not going to go into detail about the graphics or sound but i believe they were beautiful in their own way if you enjoy reading listening and absorbing a fantastic story patiently i recommend this to you"

Evolve,"enjoyed the hell out of the beta loved the game on release my mates and i pouring many hours into this game some free and paid dlc comes out which is fine as i m keen for more maps however the dlc keeps coming and coming begin thinking overkill is going overboard with the dlc still waiting on things that were promised before the beta was released features that were fairly basic and should have been in the game i was content to just stop playing and leave it at that but then overkill brought out this microtransaction weapon skin heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t despite their insistence that microtransactions would never happen so now i m here giving this a negative review it s a shame really because the game was great at first but then they just got greedy and now we re left with this before they implemented microtransactions i would have said at least they didn t get as greedy or as stupid as turtle rock studios did with their Evolve dlc but overkill went the step further and completely one upped them which is a pretty un impressive feat damn you overkill you ruined something that was fun"

Half_Life_2,"a great wild west themed tdm team deathmatch or free for all free to play game for anyone who like realistic fps games with a bit of fun this is where you should go it started off as a Half_Life_2 mod but the fan base grew so it became its own game this is one of the few free to play games on steam that are a must have just because of its simplicity i won t go into much detail but this game is like a classic shoot em up game except with a realist element added in there are a variety of very different maps and more to come in future updates the game is being updated regularly so don t worry about any bugs the game might have they get patched quickly the combat is fairly balanced besides maybe running around with a hatchet unless you come across an experienced player there are a variety of weapons ranging from pistols to shotguns to rifles to fists and legs there are some weapons that are extremely unfair for example the sniper rifle or colt walker but they are much harder to get there are 3 different kinds of chests each with their own level of weapons inside there are blue chests low tier red chests mid tier and gold chests top tier also where the sniper rifle and colt walker meantioned before are kept this chests restock with weapons after a little period of time each map has its fair share of chests but beware it takes time to open them and you must be standing near it for this to happen this also means you can not move or attack when opening a chest which leaves you vulnerable for attacks from other players if the weapon take is successful on the other hand it gives a noticable advantage when compared to the starting weapons to heal health there are whiskey bottles that respawn once drinken but they leave a kind of tipsy effect on your character for a few seconds where aiming is a bit off overall this game is definitely worth getting i mean it s free come on there are no in game purchases either and i d give it an 8 10"
Dota_2,"i began playing Dota_2 at a time when i thought moba games were the weakest of the game genres i always thought it was weird to play a game like this and whenever i saw gameplay videos of Dota_2 i had no idea what the heck was going on it never occured to me though that this game would have baited me in for more hours of playtime when i first started dota there were some training missions i had to go through these explained the basics pretty well to me and eventually i thought i knew what i was doing also i also thought there would ve been some sort of story mode due to the way the training was presented unfortunately there was none but i could see some potential for a story like mode although during my first public matchup i did feel like quiting because i really did have no idea what i was doing and my teammates were complaining about how bad i was to the other team that s right the other team our enemies then they all began calling me a noob the amount of insults i received were terrible but eventually i had a few other friends play the game along with me and that s when things began to change that s when Dota_2 became something i actually loved to play because of friends and because my friends and i got better it came to a point when we started to insult the enemy team whenever we trashed them everytime we do that it would just end up with us having fun regardless of us winning or not that s what Dota_2 is for me having a good time with friends and having fun i then tried RIRE and i came to the conclusion Dota_2 RIRE since this game is free to play i highly recommend it it s free so i say why not it s best played with people you know after all it is a team based game there are more things to talk about in dota but if you want to know what they are play the game experience it"

Team_Fortress_2,"i don t really care enough to write reviews but this game i found genuinely dissapointing i saw it on sale for about 16 the day before it s release i remember seing the e3 presentation of the game and thought hey seems like it could be a nice mystery game with decent decision making that would effect the outcome along with some rather pleasent to listen to voice acting so i had an interest in this title but did it fare to my expectations nope here s why now i am going to avoid spoilers because i respect that some will want to give this a shot themselves but i strongly recommend waiting for a sale like 5 00 sale i m going to start off with the pros because despite my over all disappointed there are some commendable attributes pros voice acting this is definitly the golden prize of the game interactions between henry rich sommer and delilah cissy jones are engaging and rather entertaining it definilty does a good job and genuinely making you feel involved in the characters relationship soundtrack the ambient acoustic guitar throughout the game never got tedious and kept me enthralled and quite relaxed art style a rather pretty lookng game i definilty sense heavy inspiration of Team_Fortress_2 especially in player model a modded asset from Team_Fortress_2 environment is pretty to look at but ultimately feels kind of lifeless story acts one and two the sense of mystery surrounding the game specifically in the first two acts definilty made a rather intense on the egde of your seat impact it was what drove me to keep playing till the end but this is where i get into the cons cons not enough depth i thoroughly enjoyed the first 40 minutes of playing i initially felt the game could ve had a lot to offer in terms of exploration i mean look at the map when you first get into the lookout it seams plentiful like there d be a lot to find and discover but unfortunately there s northing really to keep from following the rather linear pathway to keep the story rolling i didn t get the flashlight till near the end of the game and i pretty much didn t even need it lifeless when you start off and come across an elk and then a tree scratched to heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit by a grizzly i thought huh maybe there ll be an encounter with a grizzly nope asside from the gran total 3 npcs to come across there is very little wildlife present in these woods even though the game warns of these encounters they never occure ever length having finished the game in only 3 hours i finally understand angry joes contempt for short heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit titles i ve often avoided them because they aren t worth the asking price i honesltly hoped this would ve been a bit longer 8 9 hours atleast illusion of choice one thing the game did interestingly was the choices of dialogue between henry and delilah but ultimiately this was meaningless and has little impact on end game even the text based intro makes no difference whatsoever except for a naked sketch of you depending on how you choose pose that s it ending sucked a game presented like this at least could ve had multiple endings there s only two and they re both exactly the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing same all in all i give this game a 4 out of 10 it s not really worth 20 if on sale for like 5 00 and you enjoy dialogue heavy games then maybe give it a shot but for the most part it s pretty meh"

Team_Fortress_2,"a game much like Team_Fortress_2 fistful of frags is a fun western shoot em up which involves four teams to fight each other with ye olde weapons the game runs on the source engine which can lead to hilarious events with ragdolls and can cause some pretty spectacular kills 3 5 5"

The_Community,"this game carries so much with it the comedy action drama and the unqiueness of the game world in general is truely amazing the sheer size of the game and how many ways you can play it overwhelms your mind the shooter looter aspect of this game is probably the best shooter looter aspect in any game that is currently out i love borderlands 2 and would recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent experince i m looking foward to what borderlands the pre sequel holds for The_Community"
Team_Fortress_2,"falar sobre Team_Fortress_2 e meio dificil ja que de longe ele e o meu jogo favorito mas vamos comecar Team_Fortress_2 e um jogo de fps first person shooter da valve lancado em 2007 cujo tem 9 classes e uma variedade enorme de mapas alem de varias armas e cosmeticos hats miscs taunts etc entre seus mapas existem varios objetivos ctf koth payload varios e varios objetivos serio alem do jogo ter pouquissimos bugs e os que tem nao prejudicam a jogabilidade e sao engracadas o servidor e bom e raramente da lag o jogo facilmente roda em quase qualquer pc sem lag nenhum cada classe e diferente e nada se repete alem dos itens onde cada um tem sua habilidade e funcao alguns sao reskin o mais importante e a diversao que esse jogo te propoe se ta em duvida se joga ou nao isso eu te mais do que recomendo"
Dota_2,"a most beautiful game a hauntingly remarkable one at that an original ip by supergiant games coupled with the story the watermark art style the in game narration provided by rucks logan cunningham and the marvellous guitar industry soundtrack this game is worthy of any gamer s attention the lore is intriguing and the writing is very well thought out there hasn t been any other game that utilises an in game narration that comments on what you do in the game nor has it ever been used as a story telling technique this game is pretty much the paragon of this idea if it were ever to be used again logan has also done narration for Dota_2 in the bastion announcer pack and i say it would be well within reason to buy it simply for his dedication i ve checked and it s about 30mins worth of lines for every situation in Dota_2 don t do no sweat mode it s pointless and the game already has an in game difficulty changer through the use of god shrines each having a unique effect on ai behaviour and the challenges in the game are definitely not easy favourite things spike on a rail zia and zulf s theme both sung wonderfully and simply original ideas of level design and progression through an actual world that builds itself as you move around secrets are also well rewarding there s even a special secret with a certain three legged robot works perfectly with a controller tight and responsive keyboard not really recommended for the fact it can get very hectic at certain levels and certain degrees of dexterity is needed not able to be provided by the keyboard motionjoy playstation 3 usb controller can be used in place of a xbox360 controller"
Well_There,"as one of the players during its time as a subscription model this was a enjoyable experience in terms of graphical fidelity this game has a beautiful backdrop and lighting effects and artstyle of somewhat cartoonish look gives the models of both characters and monsters some justice and fits Well_There are 4 races and nine classes to choose from and each does have an interesting style for each one but some classes are locked for others and there is varying difficulty per class lore and narrative gameplay allows the player to actually meet many of the characters from the stories like strider gimli thorin oakenshield and gandalf the grey before their demise or journey in middle earth in the starting areas the loading screens also give some additional lore to what happens as players transition between towns i also love the music making system from lutes to harps in terms of gameplay however this game is a hotkey setup and does suffer from some odd pauses in combat"
The_Community,"a fast paced fast acting and very team orientated game that revolves around pushing lanes with a diverse range of characters this game does enforce the idea of specialized characters known as pros and they each play very specific roles in terms of composition of your team each comes with 3 special skills and weaponary fitting the classes appropriately for example combat girl comes with a turret named combat kitty a combat laser and a turret buff each character also comes with a unique grapple attack that is quite fun especially if it involves throwing other players off the map commentators can get annoying at times there is a very and i mean very steep learning curve and unfortunately the tutorial does not give it justice for what happens in actual matches it does not hold your hand this may deter newer players and The_Community may actually push that considering they do not take kindly to newer players but like all games there are nicer people out there"
Tf2,"a very fun yet free Tf2 game go download and play it"

Tf2,"this is a shining example on what to not buy im sorry to anyone offended however this is from my point of view and how they weakly attempted to supply anything new or making matchmaking pointless single player great i ve always taken a liking to campaign s of the various cods i liked how interesting characters were reoccuring and didn t leave you with stoney silences seeing as just like every game your character is mostly mute i however found that these new exo movements were magically selected for missions that specifically had those obstacles also how they were mostly used on one mission then discarded for the rest of the game it had interesting cut scenes ingame and premission multiplayer terrible taking exo survival into account when suddenly i remind you not everyone has 1mb download luxuries wow its really come far as in from a uav spamfest to a asm1 spamfest so about the other part of multiteamdeathpit is what i currently call multiplayer teamdeathmatch is the only played gamemode except mosh pit making most daily challenges more challenges of you patience weapons the asm1s lazers plz no positives item drop system everything found is completely free looking at you Tf2 hat sim upcoming zombies gamemode short version sp great interesting plot characters nostalgic to older games multi bad doesn t cater for bad internet dissapointing as usual silly exo moves final statement im reading up on the new cods before i buy them from now on"

The_Community,"i remember playing this game a while back and thoroughly enjoying it i never got the full version however so when i saw kag on steam i was like oh boy a game that i liked better go buy it when it downloaded i opened it and already ran into a bug the game s window was bugged i went to the options panel on the menu but nothing nothing about fullscreen or the resolution just controls and other nonsense it took me 5 minutes to find on google that you had to change it before pressing play on the little window that pops up why not just put it in the settings is it some sort of limitation on the software used to create the game so after fixing up my resolution i decide to play a little bit of sandbox and god it s horrible back in the old time of kag it had a simple building layout with 8 things on it simple and easy now you have all these wires and lamps and other bullcrap that don t actually need using what the hell is wire doing in a medieval game anyway i couldn t even select things properly they just select themself when you scroll over them this is when i quit honestly i couldn t give two damns about The_Community i just want that damn build menu fixed until then i m going to have to give this a 2 10 why must you hurt me in this way"

The_Community,"ok here s my reveiw for this game standalone mod for hl2 pros the game can be used for many things such as modelling stop motion animation firefights pictures art and buildingthe game also has a wide range of minigames withing the games multiplayer servers these range from sandbox mode to hide and seek the game is highly moddable it has a community following of modders porters for multiple games for example you can spawn in a w a c plane a type of mod that adds planes helicopters and gun down some poor innocent covenant elites from halo cons the game does offer very little in vanilla content but thats not the important part its almost nit picking the game requres other games such as cs s for most of The_Community mods this can be annoying but overall i d give it a 10 10"
Evolve,"this game is a sleeping hit more in depth review through the whole post pros story great story great ending gameplay even tho it gets sturdy and there aren t many combos you can do it s still when time comes a fun aspect of the game graphics cons voiceacting was pretty bad mediocre at best if you want it explosion effects camera sometimes it can really annoy you how when you re fighting a boss it focuses and switches you from one place to the otherit starts of really fast and you kinda bump into a story there s no background there s nothing until you progress a bit through the game even then you will ask yourself few questions like how did i get here where i am what actually happend but even those loop holes that exist in the story are minority and should be ignored the game picks it up once you go past the first chapter the combat Evolves and you feel more connection to the characters for me personaly the way it was produced i didn t feel special bond between main character nor the girl that was with you all the time story is something definitely memorable and if nothing you should check the game only for that gameplay and graphics are something that are also mediocre i would say levels are linear so there s nothing really to add up to it gameplay gets robust after a while but what s interesting in this game is that there isn t that much of a combat as i thought it would be there are few puzzles here and there but that s pretty much it graphics are also for a game that came out in 2013 i would say pretty solid nothing spectacular effects when popping up the mechs aren t fabulous but that doesn t stop this game to excell at what it s best"

Portal,"this Portal 2 mod has got to be one of the greatest things to exist on steam it had the smooth unknown atmosphere which made it seem like you dont know what will happen to you or the environment around you the detail put into this was just amazing Portal stories mel had also kept the challenging atmosphere from Portal 2 making you think harder and also making you think twice before you solve a test chamber the soundtrack was also brilliant and amazing and fits in perfectly with the style of the test the achivements are a reason why you got ta keep coming back to this i got ta say some of the achivements are challenging and worth it too virgil was a very funny sidekick to have around he was pretty genius but at the same time pretty stupid and hilarious aegis was a very cool villan to have but however his over all design in the boss battle didnt look very good if i had to recommend this i definitly would do so its really good and worth waiting for the hours to pass so it can download potatos citranium"

Besiege,"i would never usually buy a game in early access after the complete failure in my opinion of dayz standanlone which still doesn t have choppers but after looking at gameplay of this i thought i would give it a try Besiege has a fantastic engine which feels so smooth running at 60fps i have yet to find any game changing bugs and the only thing early access about it is the lack of content the way it should be i would highly recoment this game to people to try out and at this cheap price there is no point in pirating it"
The_Community,"great game tho i wish things where explained more through the game with out having to go to outside resources for help but over all 8 10 keep up the good work since the game has been released i find myself comming back new features are being implemented monthly The_Community is pretty decent and the mods for the game just keep adding to the game its a great little game well worth the price and also deffinetly a must have if u can pick it up on sale"

The_Community,"the game is perfect the only flaw with it would be The_Community and its trading and the squeakers and those p2p players that call f2p players idiots for no reason at all and those cod players that shoot every window trying to break it but as a free fps the game is absolutely good with a very very minor flaws on its gameplay but i can t really explain stuff you just got ta play the game"

The_Community,"this game is probably one of the best early access games you can get on all of steam right now beautifully optimized looks great with unity5 worth the 20 mcdee s family meal heres one such fun experience i had which had me and my mate laughing for half an hour straight pro s cons at the line we were getting constantly raided on a modded aint nobody got time fo that vanilla stuff server we made a large town with the admins of the server and named it gastown it was probably the best settlement i ever built by far fair distance away from the beach slap dab in the middle of the desert landscape there are three in total snow ice which wards off freshies and great for nighttime stalkin stalkers gon na stalk forest grasslands highlands for all the first timers who enjoy being in the presence of mutha nature and theres the desert desolate wasteland lots of quarry and pumpjack locations perfect for the marauders of the server and we had it all armoured tier 5 max protection up since we had more high quality metal than we knew what to do with we slowly invited people into our settlement of pumpjacks and mining quarries we slowly began to become the biggest band on the server long story short we got raided by ddosing hackers that kicked off everyone on the server including admins and fly hacked into our well fortified complex then ending the kick wave and letting us spawn back into our bases to find that they were all c4 d thats one of the many struggles of rust dem hackers eac seemingly does jacksh t against these hackers vac just likes to create problems on all other games that don t use source but this is rust those who played the original alpha would have known that hackers were rampant in that thus one location on the old map dubbed hacker valley mainly because only hackers were able to get there in the first place like seriously who didn t hack back then jokes aside we were kinda fed up about the whole ordeal so we took it upon ourselves and decided to go mess around with ladders and power pylons the big ones we ended up trying to spodermin up and trying to stand on it which we so hilariously failed hardcore but then we discovered we could put signs up on the pylons making a platform what was even better was that we could place furnaces n chests n sh t up on these sign platforms we pretty much had the most heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ist base on the server hell even the owner decided to come base up with us we always had plenty of freshspawns nudemans to harvest for food since they always tried to come up and raid us with rocks and spears yet we still held our ground with just crossbows and beancan gurrnades best moment of rust so far storytime aside lets see the pros and cons of rust pros well built engine uses unity5 uses it well too plenty of different experiences each server you never will know what may happen on the next server you join lotsa gunz rust has plenty of guns to fit everybody s playstyle like going as the sniopah get a bolty like it up close and personal grab a shotgun or custom smg pathfinder grab a thompson r250 rusted p250 and slap on a suppressor light packer grab the r250 and knock in some incendiary or explosive ammo you won t regret it wabbit sesun hunter grab a shotgun and load some slugs you ll have plenty of newman carcasses to feed you for a while as you see these are just some of my preset kits but ofcourse you can go ahead and go full pirate with the ak dress in red and go raiding make some of your own combinations weekly devblogs on what s going on facepunch does an excellent job of keeping The_Community up to date on what they re doing every friday of each week and we can t forget their trello trello com page where they post their conecepts on where to go for rust and it s great to say that the concept art they do is quite nice looking too especially the trainyard radtown concept lookin foward to it guys every second week updates they do an amazing job of keeping to their update schedule unlike most other ea devs fun theres alot of fun to be had in this game like me and my mate how we discovered the spodermin pylons all by happy mistakes now comes the cons hackers ofc this was going to be one issue but eac and vac are seemingly unable to deal with the hackers that run rampant on some servers theres always going to be someone who is able to crack the security there is always a way in admin abuse another big issue i forgot to mention theres some servers that have 16y o teens who think they can tell people what to do on the server and kick whoever they want just because their iceberg base got raided you will actually be suprised at the lengths people go to heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off an admin it is very entertaining p sometimes game ruining updates i have only encountered one of these bugs during a server restart where the world would not save and wipe the map of all bases but this has been since resolved a few months ago would i recommend this post apoccalyptic manhunt with explosives i fu k yes i would 10 10 ign 8 8 while i finger my prostate"

The_Community,"what can i say counter strike has always been an excellent shooter and cs go is arguably the pinnacle of the series the addition of ranked competitive matches are essential to the experience in cs go with other modes being generally less impressive than straight forward public servers seen in previous titles cheating is more prevalent than ever within ranked matches leading to many disappointing experiences especially within the higher ranked matches the monetisation of skins is purely optional and while a total waste of money it is reasonably unobtrusive if that is not something you are into the addition of wagering on professional matches in the game probably warrants an ethical discussion especially for younger players the dlc packs are generally not worth a purchase as they are now no longer required to play the maps and only offer additional achievements and vanity items having said that the quality of these dlc maps overall can be a mixed bag but regular content updates are always great to see i probably wouldn t suggest this title to younger players as the monetisation options can not be disabled The_Community is generally quite abusive and the amount of cheaters may lead to more frustration than fun for committed but less mature players having said that this is probably one of the best competitive first person shooters ever made there are quite literally hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay here due to the depth offered in both skill and strategy unfortunately much like in many other competitive online games it is The_Community that lets the game down the most with rampant cheating and generally unpleasant people being never too hard to run into i would recommend this game to any shooter fan but it s certainly not for the faint hearted expect to get seriously beat up on if you are coming in cold"
The_Community,"despite the low server population and steep learning curve this is one of the most underrated and rewardingly deep first person shooters ever made it has a genuinely unique premise excellent graphics is well optimised and stable and boasts an impressive depth of both skill and strategy to the gameplay if not for the dwindling population and high likleyhood of getting utterly detroyed by veteran players i would totally recommend that every fps fan play this The_Community is somewhere between welcoming and scornful and while newbies may be welcome in some corners this is a game where you should expect to get totally and utterly destroyed by series veterans this will forever be one of the most underated games ever made"

Nether,"reviewing each episode individually then the game as a hole spoilers ahead plus the fact that this review will be influenced by the choices i made season 1episode 1 8 10 one was definitely my favourite episode with the introducement to the main characters jesse axel olivia and lucas this sets off as the three friends attempting to build a fireworks stand at a builders tournament and a introduction to the order of the stone in which the victor gets to meet gabriel the warrior one of the members of the order after all of this crap happens you lose your pig and got ta find him meeting petra the female feminist empowering character you and her out to sell a wither skull she has found to the main antagonist ivory or as i call him the shady guy after the interview with gabriel ivory builds a wither in which the flask inorder to control is stolen from your good buddy axel and the witherstorm gones ape s t and starts consuming endercon completey after a chain of events in which you can save petra or galbriel you enter the Nether after this you find yourself at the order s temple you have to finish puzzles in order to use the amulet galbriel gave you oh ye he gives you this magical amulet to track the order you have to choose to go with olivia to find ellegard or with axel to find magnus a great fun episode episode 2 6 10 in this episode you have to choices i went with olivia so i will tell the story of ellegard you find her in her city redstonia in which you have to do some redstone crap and get into her thinking block there you must help her build a command block before the witherstorm comes and flips s t up yet again after you return you find galbriel just chillin in the temple with lucas also axel went to find the other dude after this you find the tracker to my boy soren and attempt to track his footsteps at his temple the two order members you picked up get hella mad at each other and leave after you run into ivory in which you find out he was a former order member you engage him in battle until he uses some elixir and runs away trapping you and your buddies in a library this was an ok episode probs oh though i still reckon it was the worst out of the four episode 3 7 5 10 in this episode you attempt to find soren yet again losing the amulet while diging out of the temple finding a mob grinder leads you to the end in there you find a whole wool world sorens built and a bunch of enderman he is attempting to make them build after putting the enderman suit on you try to find him after finding him he punches you and takes you inside his house there the enderman siege it and you and your buddies must escape after coming back to surface you make the super tnt crap and magnus and ellegard are back together fighting the witherstorm there you build the bomb and blow the thing up leading to the death of either ellegard or magnus getting surviors you see that the command block is not damaged and it starts sucking everything up again yet this time there is 3 of them finding either petra or galbriel you run away into the next episode this was a good episode exploring some unique themes of the power of being alone for a long period of time episode 4 8 10 in this episode you run away from the witherstorm once again and retreat to a crib in the mountains there you find out that petra has forgotten everything and doesn t remember you in which you try to figure out stuff about the witherstorm ivory comes along and soren gets hell mad that the bomb didn t work but ivory figures out to destroy it using a enchanted sword in which you and some of your buddies have to use the horses to go the far lands when finally getting there you complete this maze in which it leads you to ivorys lab there you find out the truth of the order of the stone and craft the weapon strong enough to destroy the command block in the witherstorm after leaving you finally engage the witherstorm in combat and destroy the command block but not without pay your poor pig reuben dies after galbriel reveals you and your friends are the new order of the stone in the end you can tell to reveal the truth about the order or let the people dream this episode was sick finally ending the witherstorm and knowing that nobodies can truly become legendary overall minecraft story mode is really fun game with unique character creation semi predicatable and for a so called kids game actually pretty dark with touching moments and moments of sorrow and lack of salvation though the game was pretty quick only took me 7 hours to finish it s still a really funny sick game defiantly worth buying 7 5 10 lets say 1 4 is season 1 regardless as it all links together season 2 will review when all episodes come out"

The_Community,"note this copy was given to me by the developer for review purposes this however does not change the review in anyway overviewpythagoria is a challenging puzzle game which requires you to put your maths skills to the test the game requires you to find the missing value in various area puzzles the twist is that the puzzles can only be solved by whole numbers and not fractions or decimals qualitygraphics the graphics in pythagoria have a simple look giving it a nice modern touch the puzzles themselves are drawn nicely reminding me of a blueprint of a house or building overall the graphics are drawn in great quality sound pythagoria contains a very calm sountrack that sooths you when playing and keeps the stress down from the puzzle the game includes a few different tracks instead of just one to keep the lack of boredom up gameplay the gameplay is pretty self explainable in pythagoria after you pass the first puzzle you ll get hang of it quite nicely the controls are really simple the puzzles aren t as easy though the help section is quite helpful with some tricks and suggestions on how to solve the puzzle but you still have to use your brain for this one guys ppros conspros easy controls interesting and unique gameplay has cards in the making soothing soundtrack challenging twist counters to shortness of the game great developer kind and is concerned about The_Community of his game has working out tools on right hand side pencil and eraser cons can restart can t restart game or tutorial not customisable can t change colour or font of pen and you can only erase everything on screen instead of one thing suggestions make pen and eraser customisable as in colourconclusionto conclude pythagoria is a well made brain teaser for those who want a challenge especially for a price of 1 99 i do hope the developer continues to work on it by providing more puzzles and more customisability 9 10 my rating for more recommendations by ll s game giveaways and reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here"

The_Community,"stardew valley is a heartwarming game you may pass this up in your queue as another boring indie game with pixel art graphics but if you look closer you ll find a beautiful game masterfully created by a single person with great graphics an intriguing plot and a real sense of community if you re anything like me you ll get lost within the game within your first hour many draw comparisons with harvest moon and i definitely agree but as many see it as a reimagining i see it as a spiritual successor building upon the farming and marriage aspects of the game and adding things like events community fishing mining combat foraging and The_Community centre the few things that bring the game down are its audio bugs very few gamepad support using a keyboard and mouse is much better shallow combat scheme could be built upon and pixel sizings not matching sometimes which never fails to look like a beautiful meadow with dead cows in it by this i mean when watching tv and several inventory items but all these are tiny nitpicks compared to the full game i would definitely reccomend stardew valley in fact it s my independent game of the year so far and one of my favourite games of all time and it s made by one person also it s a pretty cool game to 100 achievements are fair and not too time consuming and it s an overall fun game and The_Community centre thing is one of the best things to 100 this year in my opinion final rating 9 1 10"

Evolve,"innovation is almost always a good thing especially in the relatively saturated and homogeneous survival genre procedurally generated post apocalyptic worlds need wood get wood build block based houses form groups with other human players to survive these are elements that are as overused as the faded tighty whities that i continue to wear to date and who can forget the zombies it s always another bloody ugly zombie and that is why the long dark feels like a drop of pristine water on a wretched pair of lips its art style is bold and deliciously refreshing in a game that is intended to simulate survival in the harsh conditions of the northern canadian wilderness its rogue like elements such as permanent death and a finite amount of loot in the world shifts the player s focus from spending hours upon hours developing a character and his or her humble abode to spending hours upon hours replaying just to beat a previous personal best in terms of the number of in game days survived and instead of surviving against zombies players in the long dark are tasked to survive against mother nature which manifests in the form of biting windchills and harrowing blizzards as well as the wolf denizens that perpetually roam the snowy terrains the sound design of the long dark is also extremely well done everything from the crunch of your soles on snow to the groaning and creaking of wooden floorboards as you scavenge a log cabin for much needed supplies to the resounding bellow of your hunting rifle as you fire it at a menacing wolf sounds engaging immersive and realistic yes realism is the long dark s home address being caught outside while there is a windchill can be devastating but hiding behind rocks sitting in the path of the direction of the wind can provide temporary relief to slow down the onset of freezing the game s hunger system is also caloric based foods that you may loot from the environment have calories similar to their real life counterparts albeit scaled up slightly since all activities including sleeping and standing still burns calories in order to survive your character has to consume a certain amount of calories each day in addition he or she also has to drink at least 2 2litres of water a day to prevent being dehydrated on the other hand innovation can be a two faced heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit if taken too far it can detract immensely from a game s production values and amount to a gigantic waste of a developer s time reinventing a tried and tested wheel or removing core gameplay elements of a particular genre for no apparent logical or worthwhile purpose are typical examples of taking innovation one step too far as much as the long dark is a unique game that stands well apart from the rest in the survival genre hinterland studio has adopted a couple of gameplay design choices that are difficult to comprehend and for lack of a better word paradoxical the biggest culprit lies in the long dark s surprising lack of player interaction with the environment besides interacting with the game s various containers that exist in the form of drawers lockers cupboards stoves starting a fire and the occasional shooting of a wolf or deer there is little else that the player can do to change or manipulate the environment necessary activities such as the cooking of food harvesting of meat from an animal s carcass or the boiling of snow to make potable water are reduced to dull and meaningless loading bars that signal the progression of an activity there is no farming there is no fortifying of a prefabricated house to better ward off the cold or wolves i could think of a hundred more things that a player as a survivor in an icy wilderness would be expected to do to survive better sadly players in the long dark are robbed of those options because the game limits the ways in which they can interact meaningfully with their environment why this should be so in a survival game is bewildering it metamorphoses an otherwise open world survival game one that should be a suitable platform for the inception of personal survival stories whether heroic or tragic into a linear game of repetitive choices this is not to say that the long dark is bereft of player made choices in spite of the game s limited player environment interactivity players still have a good amount of decisions to make that dictates how well or how long they will survive in the long dark for example constantly traveling in the open when there is a strong windchill will result in your character burning more calories as he or she freezes thus requiring you to expend more of your limited food supply each day restoring those lost calories similarly being greedy and attempting to carry all of the loot scavenged from your most recent exploration trip will also result in more calories burnt as your character shoulders the heavier load making a second trip on another day to carry the remaining supplies back to your stronghold may be a better strategy finding a way to make the most out of your limited supplies is an obsession that will occupy players especially the compulsive ones for many hours on end nonetheless the negative effects on the game s longevity as a result of its decision to eschew player interactivity in favor of simplicity and ease of uptake are manifest despite the long dark currently sporting 3 different maps for players to explore in sandbox mode the relative constrained size of each map and the finite number of prefabs for players to loot means that each map can support at most 4 5 hours of proper gameplay beyond that the game starts to dEvolve into a tiresome cycle of hunting for deer or wolf foraging for wood cooking meat and boiling water to sustain your character s physical needs and resting in bed there is nothing else to do you can not build you can not farm all there is left to do is to wait for the inevitable end a most unfitting conclusion to a game with so much potential at its current sale price of usd 19 99 on steam the long dark is barely worth a buy my suggestion is to wait for a sale before spending some of your hard earned money on this game the long dark will most certainly become a better game with time on the other hand you are also unlikely to regret if you choose to invest in this game now it is one of the most polished and interesting early access survival game that is currently available on the market and if you enjoy a rogue like survival game that challenges you to do better in each successive game that you initiate the long dark is capable of providing an almost endless number of hours of enjoyment i am therefore giving the long dark the thumbs up"
The_Community,"i personally love this game it s so fun and intense every match does feel like i m in a horror film and i f ckin love it yes there are bugs with matchmaking there are some things that still need to be ironed out but at its core it works and it s fun this is a very great start and the developers are clearly driven to keep updating and improving the game they re very involved with The_Community and they have weekly twitch streams which i highly reccomend checking out i personally would urge anyone to buy it i get if it s not everyone s cup of tea but it s a fun fast paced game"
Castle_Miner_Z,"Castle_Miner_Z is a great game however it seems to be a complete rip off of minecraft it only adds a new textureless mobsno hungerharderenemy spawn at any timeand more weaponsbut other wise its a good game"
Tf2,"some people are saying that this is like team fortress 2 and it is in every good way this game is like getting quake Tf2 and gears of war all crammed into one awesome game and dare i say it this game could compete with Tf2 the only thing restricting this games true potential is the crude gameplay that involes nudity extreme gore and crude body language also you can shoot peoples genitles off and that sells it for me"

Team_Fortress_2,"i could write a detailed review about this game but come on it s Team_Fortress_2 dammit"
Portal,"if there are people like me out there who just weren t satisfied for long enough with the Portal 2 co op mode then this is the modification for you this mod had me thinking really hard from level 1 and at level 4 i even brought out a notepad to work out the positions of my players this game starts at the end of the Portal 2 campaign and helps give some fan made closure on the Portal series as did Portal prelude with the beginning of the series all in all this is a game i would certainly buy if the bugs were patched"
Portal,"it is the best Portal game yet"
Team_Fortress_2,"i ve been waiting to have at least a month of playtime to write a review but since day one you have pretty much everything you could expect from a game of this genre topped i m not a veteran of this kind of game by any means only played diablo 1 and not even a fan with this game it s a complete different story everything that went wrong with diablo 1 that i can call out myself and diablo 2 3 by others as it s a constant comparison with the now ex king of the genre is made right in path of exile it s even considered by some its rightful successor what was expected from the latest diablo title and just came out short as Team_Fortress_2 draws people from many likings into a first person shooter poe has players who are not even that into rpg s but there s something that lures them in the lore the scenery the loot system something aside from the latency drawback it s a game that has much to give to the hardcore players as to the casual ones it s made by an indie company that actively hears their player base and deploys frequent content updates and fixes still not enough reasons to try it out it s free to play damn it"
Tf2,"hi guys on m personal opinion Tf2 is one of the best games on steam for free i tottally recomend it and love it so much if your new to the game i can gelp you out just join my group at this link http steamcommunity com groups officialbrownyif you need i can teach you how to play but youll learn fast you also can play in 2 mods mvm and pvp mvm is when you hae a team of six and you vs robots but it costs money to play pvp is onlne servers so player vs player you can trade and sell anything pretty much and do heeps thx i recomend this game Tf2 i give it a 9 10"

Tf2,"at first glance hawken may seem like a fast paced easy to play balanced game you are wrong first i would like to point out some issues with this game a instead of using your own steam account to play you must make a different account which has caused me and others to wait for long periods of time just to wait for the non steam account to sync with the servers b the main menu of hawken is very confusing to most new players because it is filled with lots of advertisments to buy these special packs which is preposterous in my opinion c your starting mech looks like a friggin tv with thin limbs and legs and to customize it and other mechs you must buy some camos and decals with real money the only other way you could customize it is to change the frame of your mech and all it does is add 0 01 more colour to it d the primary guns in the game have almost identical stats as of 3 19 14 which make you waste your hard earned rewards on things that are almost the same as your stock weapon e for those gamers who ve played fast paced games such as loadout Tf2 and call of duty i would like to say that no matter what mech that you play as you will be slow and it is hard to tell if you actually damaged an enemy or not f the hud that you will be using in the game will make you feel like you re actually inside a mech which is actually nice but if you move or walk the interface will shake in what direction you re going therefore making you dizzy and or distracted by it g in the matchmaking of this game no matter what level you are you could fight anyone so what i m saying is that you could be level 1 5 but you will fight people who ve tested the alpha version of this game a long time ago and they ll show no mercy overall this game has potential but i honestly think that the devs need to work on almost everything to make this game more appealing to gamers who have played countless fast paced shooters"
Css,"i plan to write a decent rendition of why i think this is the best 4x game i have played however for now i will just say this nothing gives you more of an adrenaline rush than playing a long ironman game and having to fight a massive multi participant battle over your own homeworld as it is bombed by xenos hell bent on your annihilation with your fleets lacking a tech edge or numbers try not to shed a tear for your little virtual peeps as they migrate make friends do science and fight to the death all under your direction will you be a happy little camper in your own little corner of the galaxy or will you risk it all to bring all empires into the fold of you obviously better empire i found earth destroyed by nuclear warfare i uplifted cockroaches and allowed them to own an entire sector after a grueling war they saved my economy due to their immense help and the help of my other alien races within the uCss i gave all alien citizens the right to vote and run for any office several years later a cockroach general was on the ground when i defeated the armies on two of my long time rival homeworlds nellpa xo and it s many allies started the war with me because the uCss was making their hippy vibes feel bad not even kidding they are space bug ghandi from civ 3 wars with there alliance one loss the uCss had to give up multiple worlds one white peace we destroyed much of each other s fleets and finally victory never give up never surrender and fight if you haven t bought this and you like being immersed in games i highly highly recommend you buy this tl dr i press f to pay respects to the 1st chosen fleet that saved my homeworld and was wiped out as it lured away several empires worth of enemy fleets"

The_Community,"aight for starters this game looks mad but the gameplay is aight after you put in a lot of time and effort to get your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit together so much cancer and respawning for the first 90 levels it gets better once you re about level 90 and above you will encounter countless amounts of virgins who dedicate their lives to this game as i have encountered many getting heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit every time to counter that i have a lifeless virgin who leads me and i use to bait smashdog weapons don t really matter as much as it would in cs go how skins make you better but the guns in the game do have special stats or abilities some are utter heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t it s all skill and tactics two things that i do not possess therefore this game is too hard the thing that makes me continue to play this game is the strive to unlock useless heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit like max level abilities that make no heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing difference The_Community is crazy funny and nice unless you re kevinrudd each faction has their unique skills and weapons which i call all of them op because i m toxic the one thing i would like to change is the customizing of characters there s armors and camos that you can buy but none of them are nude pls add nude armor"
Tf2,"this game is one of the best fps games around you can customize your hats or play the game only achivement idle servers with other people max on valve servers 24 others 32 once you get good at Tf2 will be able to trade with others for weps metal hats and many more this game has a lot of updates that make it feel fresh and new end of the line was the best update for players who have been playing the game since 2007 or later cant remember when it came out you could also get into comp if you win you could get a medal trust me its better than it sounds or you could just not win and play other fun gamemodes like surf boom boom mvm for the RIRE cp hydro what is that or just some valve server always a guy with hats on i can never kill skrubs without being sniped so there you have it one of the best plz keep updating most fun unless you get rekt fps balenced disable team balance games p s dont play pyro in mann up mvm with zero tours you will get kicked"

Team_Fortress_2,"surprisingly fun even for someone like me who is hardly a poker player make sure you turn on the character banter because they have some hilarious conversations between each other going into this game max was the only character i didn t recognise but coming out of it i went and purchased the sam max game series because i found the character that entertaining extra fun to play if you own Team_Fortress_2 as you will unlock one special item from each character that can be used in that game"
Portal,"10 10it s even more entertaining when you do things the wrong way and it still works out testing the Portals on all surfaces and trying to reach somewhere ludicrous has never been more hysterical the community levels add a new dimension to the possibilities of this game the creativity of genuises out there is astounding"

Tf2,"awesome game would recommend much like Tf2 RIRE dota mc etc just one of those games you can come and go to from without hesitation wicked time killer as well if you really get into it my only question is why sometimes does my controller reverse its settings for no reason"
Team_Fortress_2,"Team_Fortress_2 is one of the most fun games ive ever played i mean if im sick of the other shooters like planetside 2 im not syaing its a bad game its certainly not or ghost recon two i turn to this game i mean with its adorble cartoony graphics and good trading system and good combat system i could spend a whole day on this"
Dota_2,"as incredibly popular as it is the game mechanics seem to be very much rendered to appeal to those already experts in the genre these finite and interesting mechanics seem to tease new players of low skill level another detterent for new players is the immediate unlock of all heroes this means that in order to find ones favorite hero players have to play through dozens of matches with new strategies and skills as a preference i would reccomend league of legends over Dota_2 for players new to the moba genre simply because of it s more accessible interface and more newb friendly system"
Terraria,"Terraria is a fun and easy to learn game it involves key building elements similar to minecraft but also includes great exploration and customization this game is a great game and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable different game"
Super_Meat_Boy,"from the creators of Super_Meat_Boy the binding of isaac is one of the most interesting and unique indie games on the market every play through is a blast and you will never have the same run twice as there are randomly generated rooms and floors to explore however in some aspects the game s enjoyment is withered and incredibly frustrating within the first 10 20 hours of gameplay and as a result you will die alot one of the finest elements that refine the game is it s randomly generated level this gives the player loads of replayability and intrigue in what might happen next time i play with these randomly generated levels the designers also placed over 20 bosses that get more and more challenging as you progress and strategies may need to be employed to bring them down but it doesn t stop there there are close to 100 items that you can collect which alters the game mechanics and even your characters appearance and that s not even including dlc with every game there are the negatives and we must discuss them so what s wrong with this game well the first 10 20 hours will kick you in the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit you will die many many times and if you don t learn from these mistakes and adapt to an enemies fighting capability you will keep getting your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kicked also be prepared to open up a wiki because when you pickup an item for the first time there is no telling what it will initially do however if you can manage to have the patience to get over that first 10 20 hour hurdle then the game will be a blast too long didn t read let me summarise positives randomly generated levels no two runs will be the same tons of unique bosses items and enemies also mini bosses comedic tone and references throughout game negatives almost sadistic first 10 20 hours no item descriptions blandly tells you item functions wtf almost unplayable without consulting the wikithis game is undoughtably fun don t let those negatives throw you off this game deserves to be played i payed 10 for this game and iv e probably milked about 5 times it s value out of it for 5 on steam 3 dlc that you should only buy once you ve completed the game several times this game is a bargain and deserves your utmost attention 9 10"
Tf2,"this game is just great it has the one thing most fps games lack that one thing is community made game modes maps ect the fact you can get the game fans and followers to create items to be put in the game is amazing it also brings a lot of diversity to Tf2 and i love playing something new everyday 8 10"
The_Community,"this game is a very fun game although very untidy it is a ton of fun and a barrel of laughs there is a warning upon startup of the game that tells you that the game is a work in progress so you can not really complain about all the bugs and problems it has but regardless of it s errors that will tick you off sometimes it is still really really fun sometimes challenging sometimes easy it really depends on the server the time you play and where you spawn the only thing that really grinds my gears is The_Community most people will just shoot you before they ask you your name so unfortunately it s shoot first or die sometimes you get the good person that is willing to help you out like myself but most people are pretty merciless also some bambi s fresh spawns will pose to be of good heart but the minute you put a weapon in their hands you better be ready to quickly draw your weapon so that is the only big big problem that might not able to be fixed but i definitely do recommend this game"
Csgo,"walking down a beach and seeing a light house walking up to it and looking up to see the massive scale of this light house scale thats what makes this game so enjoyable is the scale as i found this rock pool and i look up and see the georgeous blue sky with these rocks around it just looks so dam good now beware this is a walking sim but that doesnt make it bad as when i get home i like to relax so it s nice to come home to a plesant view and yes i am using vr but it isn t the htc vive or the oculus rift insted it is my samsung galaxy s7 and the viewmaster vr getting samsung gear vr i am also using an app call trinus vr now i can hapily say that this game is great to calm down and it s only 0 99c so you know sell a Csgo skin or a steam card to get this game"
Metro_2033,"a very short summaryMetro_2033 is a post apocalytpic first person shooter video game based on the novel written by dmity glukhovsky the story follows a young man named artyom as he travels through the dark and dangerous tunnels of the moscow metro while fighting for his life against mutants and bandits whether it is the darkness of the tight tunnels or the open space of the destroyed surface above i simply love the atmosphere i mean it s similar to every other post apocalyptic game that i ve played but this one just seems different somehow plus tiny features such as cracks on the gas mask and the heavy breathing of the protagonist makes it even better in my opinion the only downside s of the video game is the voice acting i m assuming that they were trying to steer away from the stereotypical russian accent or it s just me and my knowledge of russian accents but let s just ignore that the frame rate isn t the best either there are times when it would dramatically drop then randomly rise again i don t know about everyone else but then again maybe it s just me all in all i think it s an excellent game and to conclude this short review i give it a 4 5 5"

Garrys_Mod,"sin duda uno de los mejores juegos de accion con zombies es tan divertido es como un Garrys_Mod pero no es un sandbox y esas cosas la comunidad los mapas todo en este juego es hermoso"
The_Community,"at first i found this game a bit challenging but after a bit of getting used to i have found it easier and is one of my favourite games of all time recently i have been playing heaps and The_Community is a lot friendlier behind this game aswell example at the end of a cs go game gg at the end of a cod game you fkn suck go to hell the game is well made and the continuous content updates are great a good thing that separates golbal offensive from source is the new guns and the weapon skins for each gun giving you the ability to have cooler looking guns and more importantly stattrak which gives players who can afford it the ability to count their kills the micro transactions in this game are not forced onto you but it is a good way to gamble like if you spend 20 on an unboxing and get a 120 knife from it you made profit or you lose money that is why it s gambling and the operations which give you earlier access to community made maps and keep a personal record of your competitive scores this game is one of the best first person shooters out there and i d give it a 9 10 the ems competitions give players the chance to try get their name out there in the cs go community and also win big cash and for those who are not a good enough player who can t assemble a team it is great fun to wath"

Evolve,"i ll start off by saying that the pc port is absolute heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit even on the best hardware around this game will not stay at a stable 60 fps on high settings but i still prefer the pc version over the console version on the xbox 360 and ps3 the game often goes below 30 fps and crashes from time to time at least the pc version never crashed when i played it and it never went below 30 fps on my pc also the online doesn t work anymore because gamespy closed down so if you want to play with a friend you need to use hamachi or Evolve and run a lan game"

Dont_Starve,"Dont_Starve is a brilliant game and playing with friends just makes it all the better however there have been some pretty large changes and additions from the base game that alot of people do not like so dont expect the game to work and be exactly as the solo game but otherwise i think this game will be perfect once the through the ages dlc comes out"
Dont_Starve,"if you were left feeling a little let down after Dont_Starve s meh shipwrecked dlc then you will be overjoyed by the flame in the flood i think it s basically what klei wanted to do with shipwreked but coudn t the nomadic survival gameplay that they tried to push with the new characters is exactly what this game nails as you are forced to progress in order to survive"
Men_Of_War,"this is my previous review when i hated the game you can read it but my new review is after the below i thought it was an extremely fun game i loved the d day mission in campaign and even without the expansions it is an excellent game until i went on the game one time and found that all units and bases were invisible i tried everything and even looked solutions up on youtube but to no avail sadly this game was a waste of my money and it is now unplayable because the enemies are invisible and it just ruins the once amazing company of heroes i am now sort of hesitating to buy coh 2 becuase it could happen with that game too and coh 2 is 50 so sadly this game was a waste of time and money and unless it gets fixed i won t and can t play the game again but to wrap up on a good note i had plenty about 4 matches of good times and it is an older game so i can t expect too much cya and hope the the gods it gets fixed edit so i reinstalled the game after deleting it and i happily found out that it didn t turn my men invisible i replayed the 1st campaign 1st level but on the second level all my men and enemy men were in t pose with their guns sticking out of there chests and to make it worst everythng but the ground was black not bien racist i couldnt see my objectives becuase a huge black wall would appear in front of it and it is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit i will uninstall this game forever and go play Men_Of_War assault squad a real strategy game mowas is soo much better than ths junk and in mowas there is an editor though complicated this game is stupid and i will never waste money on sequels ore anything even if it is on sale screw this game edit sorry i raged quite a bit when i wrote the review now 2 years after uninstalling i downloaded it again the new steam version and it worked perfect i have played heaps already and i am soo happy my favourite strategy game is back in action thankyou whoever changed the game u r the best 10 10perfect"

Team_Fortress_2,"sorry for the bad english as a gamer who played formerly played world of tanks this game is one of those hidden gems in the world of gaming from your usuall fps games counter strike Team_Fortress_2 i really like it but my rating to this game is its a good game but i want to gave a low rating cause the new 1 37 patch it messed a lot in the tier of playing and the progress just to get a good plane because of the new patch im late in the tier of the german aviaton all i have is 3 planes of tier 2 plane and 1 tier 3 plane i was outgunned outpowerd outtactic with it so the lost of my interest in german planes for the new who played this may not notice but over the years playing it they will notice how long the time to just to get good plane the graphics in this game are unbelieveable with its texture and detail of just the ground its amazing but after all the need of the golden eagle in game currency is pretty much very high im using the british planes who made it to the tier 4 who is always struggling with in game credits im ending up bankcrupt this is what i fear in high tier gaming the need of a higher currency of something premium just play without any loss the in game matchmaking is one the worst that i would review the new tier system making a lot of pro players in tier 3 and the new players who just made it to the tier 3 are very unbalanced considering myself using russian tier 3 planes i see this often sometimes i get too good because of the new players that i dont like it because its not challenging enough and a whole of pro players that pretty much dominates every one but some of those pro players are positive hacker because i once saw a low tier plane a6mn just ripped a wing of a well armored bomber b 25 mitchell in seconds of firing it so the match making system one of worst in war thunder overall this game is perfect for the players bored with the ordinary first person shooter game a high graphic picture its more a pay to win game"

The_Community,"at first i was not 100 sure about buying or passing mostly owing to the simple art style and the fact its a tower defense which are a dime a dozen now days however after looking at reviews and seeing some high praise and checking the forms and seeing active dev s interacting with The_Community decided to give it a try the first thing i met was a user agreement which is fairly common now days however unlike others i actually read it was very simple and easy to understand made a nice impression and told me about their attention to detail before even accessing the first screen of the game this attention to detail was further proven once within the game the customization in just the options menu alone warrants this game being noticeable i can t say if you will find it worth your money but if you have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket or see this on sale well worth full price in my opinion grab it this game and its developers are like a unicorn in this day and age they clearly care about their players and the product itself will be keeping a eye out for future releases from them if you have any doubts look at a few of the stickied threads to see the developers love for The_Community and the game and notice that to date there are 377 positive reveiws and only two negative p"
The_Community,"i m sorta torn on my opinions of this game while gameplay is definitely fast paced and fun some game mechanics are a little broken imo for example some of the duel wielding smgs can three shot you in the knee and still kill you while some of the assault rifles take 4 5 shots through the chest also some players who have played the game and the series for a long time will have better perks and weapons so they can just get a few easy kills get a massively overpowered killstreak reward and dominate the entire game The_Community could also use a little dusting up visuals are nice and run smoothly on old pcs and games can be fun if played with the right people of similar skill level price tag is very overpriced imo for a game that s two years old and already has had 2 sequels released in the period"

Portal,"this game will throw you into a pit where once you kill all the enemys which don t play around a Portal opens and you decend to the next stage whilst playing i found myself being torn to shreads by some of the most simplistic enemys all because i was not prepared for there to be 15 of them tearing through the game as quickly as possible is on of the most funnest but most stupidest ways to play this with such a limited amount of health and with enemys that do extreme amounts of damage it becomes a slaughter house if you don t prepare this game is thrilling and will keep you wanting more but will make you rage like a russian 12 year oldcykaa"
Evolve,"pros doesn t require a super computer to run challenging game play that doesn t require superman s reflexes and batman s intelligence to get past the third level visually pleasing doesn t rely on hyper realism the storyline is decidedly not about people murdering each other in a gory war between good and evilcons very weak cliche storyline there isn t really much time during the actual level to plan what to do and it can quickly dEvolve into a mindless click fest usually to your detriment in later levels somewhat counter intuitive interfacei rate this 3 moe out of 5 kawaii"
Portal,"pretty good game trilogy good story and character development one thing that i find really impressive is how alyx vance is a follower in most of episode 1 and 2 and she never gets annoying and she barely gets in the way either its also pretty cool how its set in the same world has the Portal series it needed a better soundtrack though and the gameplay can get a bit boring and repetative at times and it has very few wow moments its a pretty good game and i cant wait until half life 3 half life 2 episode 3 comes out if it comes out"

The_Community,"i remember seeing this game around a year ago lets say it was good then but it s even better now maybe not everyone likes this game but the amount of detail put into this game is just amazing the game is about running a prison and it sticks by it your prison is in your hands but my favorite part is that it s not fully in your control sure you can assign patrols and use non lethal but very effective tools to placify an inmate but even with that you will always get terrified if one prisoner starts rioting and they take out a weapon the guards can fight them but they attack other inmates then its the matter of getting a guard asap to the area or risk a life or 2 and recently when the ability to fail was added suddenly you couldn t let the inmates escape or let a riot go on for too long which made it more intense when a riot broke out the developers themselves are probably the most best ive ever seen they never get off track with other ideas as explained in one of their videos but they take ideas from all the players and get The_Community and are now working to wipe most of the bugs out of the gameas mentioned before not every person may like this game partly because of the amount of patience needed but i dont care in my opinion also the freedom of the modding community is perfectthis game takes the idea of running a prison and strategy and mashes it up into one game would i reccomend it of course i have put hours not only building my own prison but downloading others huge riots fires and a prison built for 16 must quickly be adjusted for 45 you dont have to but to sum all of this up in 3 words they would be buy this game"

Tf2,"an excellent game combining the foundations of the classic moba genre with the frantic fast paced shooting of Tf2 would definitely recommend"
Tf2,"this game is absolutely amazing if you re a hardened fps veteran or even a newbie you will definitely enjoy this game first off i have never played any quake or unreal games so i m very new to the fps sub genre that ratz occupies so this game was completely new to me but boy what a breath of fresh air it was firstly the graphics never have i seen a game with such simple but at the same time elegant graphics having such simplistic graphics not only makes the game look nice and modern it also helps you spot the enemy rats that could be lurking around the corner just waiting to shoot you secondly the level of customisation in this game is astounding you can customise your fov so you can either be like a quake pro or have a call of duty esque fov like me but that s not all you can also customise your laser colour type enemy colour gibs crosshair and team colour you can also disable the ingame music so you can add your own heart pumping music to suit your playstyle also the gunplay is very barebones but at the same time very fun and enjoyable everyone gets the same beamshooter gun which means that no one is every at an advantage over another player and therefore who gets the kills is determined purely by player skill rather than a weapon advantage also if you re familiar with Tf2 or other games where shooting rockets at your own feet is beneficial you ll love this game the beam jumping in this game is so fluid even at a high ping that you ll be impressed by the mobility you can achieve with your beamshooter with the jumping you can constantly strafe around the map but you can also reach strategic map positions that can help you gain an advantage over your enemies the maps in this game all have their own unique style and i ve also noticed that they all seem to have a different colour palette for example one map may be predominantly green coloured while another could have mostly red tones all maps which i ve played seem to have a good balance between stratergy and fun although some maps are definitely more enjoyable than others in the end no matter what map is chosen you should have a blast playing finally the gamemodes due to a lack of players i ve only been able to play deathmatch so far which is enjoyable even in its own right the other gamemodes are classic staples you have duel capture the flag and survival i can t really talk about these modes since i ve never played them but according to other people they are great fun to play overall this is an excellently made game that excels in all aspects of its design from the gunplay to the customisation you should have an excellent time playing ratz"

Starbound,"so far i have only played 36 hours of Starbound and i would certainly recommend this game pros has quite a lot of features considering it is an early access game that might be because it is nearly out of early access some people might think i am talking rubbish here has very little bugs has a very detailed character creation giving you the ability to customise your character to your likes music is also very nice the interface is very easy to used to and after a while feels natural to expand on reason 1 you can upgrade your ship mater manipulator basically starter mining tool that can mine everything but slowly every race a little back story to it you can get special abilitiescons some quests are a bit ridiculous e g for one quest i travelled at least 3 solar systems trying to find a floran villageto sum it up i think it is a pretty polished up game and it has a lot of content and will sell well"

Evolve,"great game so far even though its in alpha i still think stranded deep has a chance against big titles such as rust or ark survival Evolved it will be amazing in the future with ideas such as multiplayer co op and non co op aswell as a proper finishing game storyline i hope this game gets lots of support in the future for this could be the next game we see at e3 o"
Portal,"best Portal mod ever"
Undertale,"just finished Undertale after weeks and weeks of playing so worth it"
Portal,"this game projects a similar atmosphere to that of Portal 2 puzzles both simple and complex a very institution like environment and an almost complete lack of storyline or context that leaves you wondering at the very end wait what a brilliant game that is well worth the money"
Portal,"ignore everything you see and hear while playing this game because your senses will lie to you countless times i believe polygon nailed it when they labelled it a mobius trip a brilliant game full of simple yet complex tricks and puzzles that challenge you at every corner while instilling upon you a deep and meaningful rhetoric i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the puzzles present in the Portal games"
Tf2,"this is a good game its cool funny and you can buy items like Tf2"
Evolve,"i really enjoyed dead by daylight when i could get a game they basically took the concept of Evolve but did it much better the only problem i have with it is that it takes forever to get a game because it only searches for a couple of seconds and if it doesnt find a game it says no matches found and you have to click search again which can get really annoying if they fixed the searching i would say it is one of my favourite games but i just get bored of waiting to find a game and its not like you can go watch youtube or anything cause you have to click search every 5 seconds"
Evolve,"the game has very nice graphics that could be improved on as well nice smooth controls when skulking around pun intended as you don t have to constantly hold down ctrl like in avp although you do find yourself stuck on little objects a fair bit and it is a challenge to sometimes get on the roof of a room however i m not saying that is a good idea as you will have trouble getting to your enemy before you get shot making it sometimes difficult to get away although due to the small objects that are included you can t easily blend with the wall you can however easily use the small pieces to do nice leaps from wall to wall to accelerate you that was only talking about the graphics and skulk though as the aliens or karah you can Evolve into different types flying slashing tank and the cute support allowing you to also Evolve to the new types each set with separate abilities the marines look like they have it tough but in fact they do not as the marines being equip with an arsenal of ranged weapons along with jet packs allow them to dodge attacks and kill something before it get to them usually it may seem that the game has a variation of 2 gametypes to play fast and abusive or slow and stealthy but there is also a third variation the commander without the comm commander you will be screwed and without a good comm you will also be screwed as a comm on either team are required to be able to place support structures and upgrade you this means that if you are more of a good strategy top down player then you don t have to go looking for another game honestly its like 2 games in one there s one major floor with some of the levels though some are too wide this makes it nearly impossible for the karah to win there are some rooms where the moment the marines capture it the karah aren t able to even enter the room as they are to wide open there is also glitches in the maps that stop the comm from placing connection nodes called cysts these cysts are the karah s way of transferring energy where you are meant to be able to an annoyance is that sometimes you will get base rushed and that s the end of the game no joke once your base is attacked within the first 15 minutes you are placed in a permanent disadvantage this problem is in many games though and can not be solved by devs so nearly every player on this game has a mutual understanding not to egbr early game base rush so it is currently quite rare to see a base rush within 15 minutes or so of a match starting another major problem is the difficulty curve due to the fact that there is practically no training trying to understand how to play properly and learn how to dodge bullets is simply not possible the training in the game is mostly just a movement tutorial as the bots are very unresponsive although there is a video tutorial which helps when trying to understand the games mechanics in total ns2 is well balanced and if you stick with the game long enough it will end up being incredibly fun it only takes about 1 hour to fully understand the game well for me it did i almost forgot to mention the loading times take about 5 10 minutes graphics extremely smooth controls multi genre teams are nothing like each other acceleration physics used as mechanic original character variety proper stealth mechanics character traits stay for only that character type modding support bias maps map glitches egbr problem anti egbr community mostly difficulty learning curve training practice mode helpful tutorial bad bot ai loading times scoring 22 pros8 constotal 14 prosn number of cons pros totala answer depends on cons majority or pros majority 0 1667 n a 50 1667 14 2 334 5 7 3 10"
The_Community,"the game alike its brethren endless space has stunning graphics however it is styled in 8 16 bit i e the game keeps style with the old bit like games but does not look completely like an old cartridge game the game play is surprisingly smooth and easy to understand but the game gives quite the challenge regardless what character you have or how skilled you are every level and play through you will have to think strategically and place defences so you also have to keep a constant watch on your hero s life as well make sure that your producers are all equal or close in production or focus mostly on one type as you traverse through the seeming less endless floors every item that you get holds a big value even if it is a stray jacket there are a few glitches left in the game but all are being fixed quite constantly by a very active dev team which are probably the most friendly dev team you will ever come across and The_Community even friendlier the music is done by flybyno the musician for the well known endless space has again created more masterpieces the music in this game is very well thought out as the music does not make you have to battle with it in order to think of strategies rather it helps you while setting the mood and vibe very well the calm music slow paced and thought inventiveness is what makes the entire game so relaxing most of the time yet so frantic at others the multiplayer however is still having difficulties but has only recently been released so is technically in beta still the multiplayer regardless of your upload speeds download speeds has a big lag problem which is getting much better slowly over time as it isn t amplitudes forte but they have worked with multiplayer on turn a based game before at first glance the game looks entirely turn based d o t e is part turn based part strategy and part real time the turn based comes from the doors and the material obtaining being that each turn is counted in doors the strategy is obvious planning where you will go and where certain things go along with the difficult choice of weather should i have all defence in here or make it a place for my hero s to heal or both will be asked about in every room that becomes available to you to place defences an the such there is more strategy in the characters as well as you will have to plan who gets what and who should have what role which becomes even larger and harder to do in multiplayer more on that later in fact you even have to plan your escape finally the real time comes down to doing all of the above whilst being attacked placing defences watching your health equipping items you name it you can do it in real time when the waves of monsters are out multiplayer doesn t only have problems with lag or randomly disconnecting but also somewhat in communication and majorly in sharing items when there is an item no one knows what the chest holds so no one knows what the item is until they pick it up once the item is picked up instead of the item going into the global inventory it goes into the personal inventory which if you cant equip the said item for any reason you cant drop it nor trade it in any way this makes the game more difficult as loot gives more bonuses and traits than levelling meaning your entire team is more likely to die unless you all get lucky next problem is communication due to the lag building things and claiming a room becomes more difficult as more than one person may try building claiming at once the only way around this currently is to let the host of the server to build claim meaning your entire team will depend on you if you are the host all up the game is well balanced not pain numbingly boring even after a few plays and looks very good for its chosen style great graphics design smooth controls very easily understandable simple tutorial awesomely challenging extremely well balanced multi genre active devs extremely friendly devs extremely friendly community perfect music multiplayer very laggy disconnecting multiplayer very interesting mechanics mutiplayer inventory problem muliplayer communication problem 34 pro s8 con stotal 28 pro sn number of cons pros totala answer depends on cons majority or pros majority 0 1667 n a 50 1667 26 4 334 5 9 3349 3 10 if the mutiplayer was fully fixed and the tutoral a bit more advanced i e more interactive it would be a 10 10"

Terraria,"starbound is a stunning and fun game that is easy to learn and play by yourself or even with others you can choose your race and customise the appearance of your character you are spawned in a random planet that is chosen by the computer from a variety of worlds similar to Terraria you have to scavenge for supplies weapons and resourses to build a home and live in a safe friendly environment except in starbound you don t live on just one planet for the whole time you can gather fuel such as xoal for your ship to run and take you to a new and completely different planet filled with totoally new generated caves enemies dungeons and many more as starbound is still in early access i think the directors of this games have done and outstanding job so far i think this game deserves a 8 5 10 based on the early access stage"

Well_There,"this game starts off really well as the transition from the old 8 bit era to the 3d part is pretty cool but this transition happens in a space of half an hour and the game turns for the worse after the game becomes 3d after that it becomes a bad zelda and final fantasy clone the turn based strategy is way too easy as your partner has a heal spell that is effective considering how little damage the enemies do she doesn t do a whole lot of damage except for x crystal but the hero can do just as Well_There is no limit on how many times you can use her spell and it heals both characters at the moments when she isn t around you have enough money to buy a bunch of potions to last you until your partner comes back because of this the battles will get boring and mind numming very quickly and you ll start running from battles just to get past them the action adventure gameplay isn t as bad as some of the levels have intresting mechanics like shifting back and forth from 16 bit to 3d but these sections don t last as long and they don t get repeated they should ve stuck with these ideas as it could ve added more puzzles and ways to get around them instead it focuses more on the combat which is stiff to say the least overall it takes a lot of ideas some from other games and some entirely unique and sticks it all together instead of getting a few ideas and expanding upon thoses to make the game feel like an exploration through the action adventure genre rather than a game that took ideas from other games in hope of it working well combined the fact that the game is really short and that it s 10 this game isn t worth getting"

Starbound,"best sci fi game sound track ever this game has sucked more hours away from me than dayz but it does it in a non intrusive kind of way unlike dayz where you feel every second of every minute of every hour of the day Starbound eases you into a false sense of control what was once a quick 11pm mining run easily and unnoticeably turns into a 3am dash for cash to the center of the earth been playing a little of the single player campaign to learn the ropes and get a feel of the mechanics but this game really shines with a few mates online in a locked down server working together for hours and hours on end crafting building hunting looting cooking etc many a times have we seen the sunrise while playing this game and thought to ourselves another day at work with less than 3 hours sleep totally worth it"

The_Community,"after the recent patch robocraft has become quite similar to a moba now while some of The_Community has disliked this i feel this will help it in the long run the new gameplay mode does take longer however it does provide new opportunities for interesting gameplay as well as becoming longer the devs have added a shield around the base that heals you and goes down after the opponents have control over all the newly added towers these new game mechanics have really added to the strategy of the game no longer will your opponents rush at you trying to take your base early instead they will try to take towers as you fend them off and try to take towers of your own one of my favorite moments in this game was when i was the last surviving member of my team and the enemy was attacking my base using the new shield to my advantage i and a large amount of drifting and strafing i was able to destroy the attackers and with the overclocking i had gained led a successful charge on the enemy base after we had taken all the towers overall the game is very fun and i would recommend picking it up"

The_Community,"it was such a good game all the way until almir made the worst move he could ve done at the time microtransactions 2 years prior to this incident almir stated himself we ve made it clear that payday 2 will have no micro transactions whatsoever shame on you if you thought otherwise source http forums steampowered com forums showthread php t 3127521 however he openly admits that the incentive behind the black market update the update which introduced microtransactions was money based the success of payday 2 has also changed overkill for the worse and diverted their attention and focus to money rather than support not only has overkill shamelessly defyed their own promise and introduced microtransactions but these microtransactions boost stats i ve supported this game despite the overflow of dlcs being introduced every month but this is sadly the last straw it is much to The_Community and myself s chagrin to see game with so much potential to decline like this"

Tf2,"some people will look at this game for the first time and say something like just another zombie game or the occasional fanboy would yell c o d black ops ripoff but this game is not something like that this game is not just a zombie game but an action adventure game too the characters you play as are very memorable and you will more than likely grow to like them by the end of their group s respective stories which brings me to happily say that the left 4 dead characters are back in this installment with their campaigns remade which could potentially bring a new feeling when playing those levels depending on how you look at it the new characters sport their own set of campaigns that are also extremely fun the amount of different weapons might be underwhelming if you are a big player of Tf2 or loadout but i think in this kind of game that s ok because we don t need heaps and heaps and heaps of weapons i also love how many different game modes there are in this game ranging from a versus mode where you play as the infected one round and the survivours the next realism when you play in a real apocolypse type setting and the many many mutation modes which tweak the normal campaign gameplay the soundtrack i personnally don t think is too good but without a doubt the music mods on the workshop are just amazing this game comes with a fully working steam workshop that can range from hud mods all the way to changing the music of the jukeboxes this is without a doubt awesome and definately worth 10 15 mins of searching through and going on a mod binge i can safely say that this is my favourite zombie game i ve played ever"

The_Community,"this is all based on my own opinion dark souls 3 is a hard game that breaks off then the easy rpg it never tells you were to go and it sure as hell doesn t give you an easy time when you get to the place you need to be when i first started playing it took me around 3 hours to actually defeat starting boss spoilers ahead ludex gundyr and vordt then make it over to the next area i think i made 3 4 different characters to defeat ludex because i needed those firebombs to kill ludex gundyr thankfully my friend s started to help me through the game once i got near the first lord of cinder i ve completed the game over 7 times now i m always trying different builds and seeing if i enjoy it or not most of my play time now instead of trying to complete the game again is helping out other players and pvping and praising that i don t get into a fight club some people you find are fun to play with constantly chucking down hello carvings and doing gestures whilst others don t even gesture before going into a boss fog or slicing you to death a few times i ve gotten a good laugh out of some people i was once invaded someone and they looked like a phantom due to using a ring i waited a bit nearbye and then walked over he did a gesture to look like he was resting at the bonfire he waved i did my thanks i used the bloodlust katana to stab myself and rest whilst doing that i realised that the bonfire wasn t lit so i wanted to be kind and wait for the host to come he constantly pointed at the unlit bonfire and so did i he brang out his bloodlust katana and started to stab himself to do death i clapped constantly he kept going and killed himself a moment later i see on my screen host of embers destroyed tl dr etc is pros semi long game different to other rpg s tries very hard to keep secrets to other areas hard game allows for all different kind of playstyles doesn t matter what class you select at the near end game once you ve found most things community is most of the time fun funny to play with The_Community is happy to help each other out most of the time addicting if you like the game itself etc cons some op weapons some bugs that can pretty much one hit something that can be reposited for some people the game not telling them to go can lead to frustration starting players will try to kill everything in there path leading to the annoyance of dying to things much more powerful then you for some people it is easy to not do one thing right and that will lead to your death etc thanks for reading my review longest one i ve done don t forget to praise the moon have a good day"
The_Community,"ark is a great game i think most people can agree on that and not even finished that s pretty good too but releasing a paid dlc in early access please just no dlc s with more maps that people without the dlc can t play and at a price at 20usd is just an annoyance take payday 2 and arma 3 for example people hack the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out of payday 2 because of all the dlc s just to play them without paying over 200 heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing dollars for all the dlc making another map just splits The_Community and i personally don t think this game can have The_Community split into two atleast in oce servers i see about 3 servers out of about 30 with more then 10 people now would i suggest this game yes would i suggest getting the dlc your choice but personally i m just hoping they make it free we don t need this heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit look at arma 3 like 40 dlc for a map etc in my group of people i play with we literally have to go around and ask each other if we have the dlc required to use a gun or drive a car it s just a pain in the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit and an annoyance thanks for reading i hope this helped you decide on if you wanted to get the game or not lets hope that the dlc becomes free if it doesn t get the sales it needs to become profitable in some shape or form"

Css,"gta v is the great masterpiece of rockstar that is like mona lisa to leonardo da vinci it was originally released on xbox 360 and ps3 in 2013 i will be honest here i got into the hype and preordered the game just because i knew that it would be the definitive sequel that gta iv needed so badly and the expectations did not fail short from the trailers i loved it all the story the driving draw distance shadows combat and the way the guns feel online wasn t great for me but at least i got compensated along with many others 500 00 from rockstar themselves as an apology for the issues in october overall it was amazing to say the least with my experience and it was well rendered on 8 year old hardware now here comes the remastered version for xbox one ps4 and eventually pc now i didn t buy gta v for the consoles because i knew the pc version would out class the consoles themselves and i am happy to report that gta v runs well on my laptop don t ask the texture quality is superbly increased tenfold and makes the game livelier i got more immersed playing it on pc more than the last gen consoles but the next gen would also show similar immersion results modding is also an advantage for pc players and you can now rest easy that rockstar won t ban you for modding in single player i modded the game to have the scripthook mod and radio stations on foot making the rampages more entertaining than the in game music for the graphic obsessed tuners there are a ton of options to tweak them to your liking with many types of anti aliasing such as fxaa msaa and nvidia s txaa with shadows amd has chs while nvidia has pCss if you are confident in adding more beauty there is the advanced graphics option and boy does it punish your pc in performance a lot but the results are worth it but wait there ' s one thing also that the pc version has that the consoles don t have support up to 4k definition more on 4k later the movie editor included is a crafty equipment for when you want to make many genres of television and movies or re create your best moments and brag about in youtube or the social club personally i am really confused about how it works but i prefer modding mayhem to anything else first person mode which was present on the next gen consoles is still present on the pc version and adds an extra layer of immersion to top it off the animations and the extra detail such as floating garbage on run down streets and cockroaches on the floor in trevor s trailer make it more realistic in detail than in third person now about 4k you need a super sli or crossfire to manage up to 60 fps in performance wise but it pays off as it looks drop dead gorgeous to look also if you were an originally playing the game before on old gen and you have a social account linked to you online account for xbox live or playstation network you get special perks such as a railgun hatchet duke o death stallion murder mysteries for noir filters animal photography that unlock a new submarine dodo seaplane monkey mosaics that reward you with a go go monkey blista and exclusive cars that can be won by racing in new muscle races now there are more variety of animals that can be found in the game and you can even play as them by finding peyote plants and chewing on them also there are two new radio stations one of them is the lab while the other one is self radio now in order to get it working put your music in the documents under rockstar games gta v music and place them there it ' s a great update to the game rather than just simply making it nicer for the eyes unlike some other games however not everything is perfect several areas of the map can drop the fps and the launch was a bit of a disaster as people reported that their usernames were causing gta v to not launch at all the download times were also painful when you launched the game after you finished you preload because there is a day one patch for the game that is mandatory and it took me almost an hour to launch the game because of the slow download speeds and the size of it next thing is i had to update my drivers because the fps were fluctuating and it annoyed me beyond irritation however this did not stop me from enjoying the game also you must have a social account because of the launcher requires it it will be mostly annoying but seeing as i already created one it didn t bother me much from a techincal pov the online heists make finally an appearance before and that s also the selling point for going back again other than the expanded amount of people that can go into a server up to 30 players not much has changed but where does this lead to even if it had a few hiccups the pc version of gta v is definitely the definitive edition and i do appreciate the effort that rockstar did even though delaying it is frustrating the result is a pc game that you shouldn t definitely miss it towers over gta iv red dead redemption and max payne 3 in

The_Community,"the alpha of h1z1 was off to a very rocky start the game was absolutely riddled with bugs rendering it almost unplayable and to make it worse we found out that while soe had said that the only buyable objects would be cosmetic we later found out that this was not the case every person on the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit server with a couple of bucks to spare was calling in an air drop giving them guns tools and food so that they would have a major advantage over the competition but luckily those days are far behind us thanks to one of the best alpha development teams i have ever experienced they listen to what everyone in The_Community says most bugs are fixed within a day of them being reported and the rest they choose to keep working on full bore until they are fixed and i must say thank god they fixed the air drops air drops are now easily able to be seen by whoever is in your corner of the map the range in which they are dropped is far greater meaning that as opposed to you buy an air drop and you get it you are instead having to compete with a barrage of other players for your prize and finally the drop rate of things like guns and other weapons in an air drop has been dramatically reduced so that they won ' t set you to far ahead of the competition this has all helped to turn the game into a far more playable and enjoyable alpha if you want to get an idea of what the game might be like then just picture this day z but made by a far greater team with superior skill and coding knowledge who will in turn choose to listen to what their players ask for and fix every bug that crops up this game is how day z should have been the forest could have been and rust will never be i must put this out there this game is the most fun that i have ever had in an alpha or even a beta for that matter and i am putting that down to the wonderful team of devs behind it the animations though only in alpha are beautiful and fluid there is a smooth transaction between different actions and a polished look to them normally only seen in finished games the graphics while not that bad could definitely use some texture updates before the final release of the game as they are currently looking a few years behind schedule but that is only expected in an alpha and finally i must just put it out there to all you gaming bullet fans that this is currently the most polished and enjoyable alpha on the steam market and thanks to some beautiful optimization it is playable on most average systems but never fear if you are currently strapped for cash but wish you could still play the game it will be free to play to the general public upon final release one thing that i have currently forgotten to mention is the beautiful design of the games ai zombies are as dumb as they should be and not much of a problem alone but are attracted to things such as sound meaning if you fire a gun at the wrong moment you could have a pack of as large as fifty zombies hunting you down at once which can cause quite a problem the way they have designed and built this ai really impressed me they act exactly as you would imagine a zombie should dumb and only a problem in numbers and this ai design has carried over to other creatures found in the game world from skittish deers to ferocious wolves ready to attack anything in their sight and terrifying bears who once locked onto you are probably some of the most dangerous creatures in the game the combat in this game has been beautifully designed the actions are smooth and you are actually able to feel the power as you send a fist flying into a zombie s head as they send a hand back flying towards you the weapons while in most cases rare are very powerful and will give you a huge advantage over the competition while items such as combat knives and machetes will give you the upper hand in close quarters combat a bullet from any of the guns can be absolutely devastating but remember that a gunshot can be heard miles away so be careful not to attract the horde or worse another human hungry for your blood so have i enjoyed h1z1 in the two short weeks this game has been out it has come so very far from the buggy pay to win mess it once was to the beautifully polished and enjoyable alpha it is today i must say that it is hands down the most enjoyable alpha or even beta that i have ever played it has been twenty dollars well spent and all thanks to the amazing team of helpful and responsive devs creating it i would strongly advise any of you zombie or survival fans out there to give this work of art a try and all that i am left to say is that i can honestly not wait for the next big update and eventually the final release of the game soe you have really outdone yourself this time check out more reviews and previews at gamingbullet com"

Tf2,"i loved this game however i can not recommend this game after the most recent update Tf2 was the game where you just jumped in and mucked around you looked up the servers you wanted to play on and jumped in and out at your leisure their latest update has killed aspects of the game that i loved valve removed all of their servers from the browser they had the best servers you could vote for the next map kick tossers and hackers now you are left with community servers there are some out there that are good but are prone to advertising plugins and admin abuse hacker s delight pray to gaben that you don t end up with a hacker in casual play in my last game the opposing team had a blatant hacker i don t call people out for hacking at a whim and even his own team acknowledged it however in the new casual mode there is no way to remove these players from the game you can t vote kick them off if you leave you get penalized for abandoning the game which is ludicrous who the hell thought this was a good idea you assume the recovery position suck your thumb and wait for the round to end then wait for the next vac ban wave and hope it s soon casual play randomness you can t choose what game type you want you can minimise the randomness by clicking a few buttons and then hope for the best if you re proficient at multiple maps then great if not there isn t a way to choose specific maps or guaranteed a game type word is some of these things will be fixed doesn t seem likely they ll return the valve servers to the browser real shame that"
The_Community,"this game is every thing i was wishing for its flawless gameplay combined with not being hard to learn plus this game gets straight to the point which makes it a excellent choice for someone who likes to have fun instead of spending 10 minutes trying to figure out what everything does as of yet while im still learning the game in many ways i have not won a single 1 v 1 match and The_Community is rather small but they are friendly and easy to get along with apart from one guy who was raging over the fact i was using strategy in a strategy game if u get this game and cant find a player match bot matches are fun with a smart ai that makes you think your opponent is a human player although i recomend trying to get a friend to play this game with as the game is much more enjoyable with friend to play it with"

The_Community,"note keep in mind the game must be paid for in order to play at the moment as it is in early access it will become free to play at around the end of the year also a lot of the negative reviews on the front page are complaining about issues that have been fixed or changed or complaining about features that are not in the game yet in my opinion this game has a lot of potential even though it is currently in early access it feels like it has enough replayibility to keep me going for hundreds of hours with the latest update now here are some of the pros and cons for the game in its current state some pros pretty art design the way it is done gives the game a more toon feel to it alot more enemy diversity compared to dd1 the game is regularly updated with the latest patch adding loads of content in to the game the people who work on the game interact with The_Community and hold developer streams on twitch every friday according to the developers there won t be dlc map packs so The_Community won t be split the music in the game is good the towers have more personality as i would call it once it goes f2p it won t be p2w betsy and cute propellor cats if you do buy early access you get 30 worth of ingame currency to buy costumes with a few cons it s in early access so you have to pay to be able to play it tavern is laggy and the game feels slightly unoptimized uber skill spheres cost waay too many wyvern tokens i call the tokens betsy bucks level cap that does not take long to reach level cap will be increased later on earlier maps become meaningless to play once you hit level 25 they are adding incursions soon for them to make them playable in late game again bug paradise no controller support yet note most of the problems i have with the game a due to the game still being in development and a lot of the features are not in it yet final verdict while the game is unfinished and has it s fair share of problems it s fun which is what people really look for in games 8 10 in it s current state"

The_Community,"i will start by saying that cs go is a good game that can be a lot of fun the casual modes allow players to play a variety of game modes in a non competitive way so why the negative review the ranking system has severe problems and The_Community can be toxic at times so the problems smurfs - not a lot of fun to play with higher skilled players getting kicks from kicking the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out of lower levelled players de rankers and trolls - can be smurfs trying to drop pack again through ranks or someone getting kicks from being annoying can ' t votekick if 2 5 players on your team are doing it hackers - i don ' t come across these as regularly as some do but still very annoying bad community - if you have a 5 person team you might be okay playing solo it feels like a gamble sometimes you get friendly people in teams and other times abusive people plenty of 12 year olds have had sex with family so they claim also never heard the words heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit and etc used more than in this game so why do i have so much play time the game itself is good to play and when you win it really is satisfying the issue is mostly some people who ruin it for others however it can be fun and casual is always an option if competitive becomes too much"

The_Community,"this would have to be one of the best early access titles that i purchased being a big fan of the original installment when i heard about the second installment i was excited did this game manage to live up to the excitement yes definitely the only flaw currently that i have found is the lack of content but this game is in early access and more content will obviously be added from the as of 24 04 2015 4 hours that i spent playing this game both solo and with friends i feel like this game has incredible promise the good visuals this game s visuals are stunning the graphics have received a very nice upgrade from this game s predecessor without taking away from the style that the first game portrayed performance this game has very good optimization i was able to run the game on medium to high on my low end pc and still manage a stable 60fps with only a few ocassional drops gore the gore system got a massive overhaul which just makes it so much more satisfying to blow the heads off of zeds and watch it literally explode spraying everything in blood each zed has a huge amount of points of dismemberment so you can quite literally tear them limb for limb ui the user interface got some heavy tweaking compared to the first game making everything more sleek and easy to access the vendor pod has a very nice interface as well with everything laid out infront of you without having to scroll down or across classes although only 4 of the classes are available at this point in time the skills class perks feel rewarding for the effort you put in sdk the game has been noted to have the sdk and community creations implemented later on in development which is great as i found The_Community creations one of the best parts of the first game humour that s right the wonderful british banter from the first game makes a comeback better than ever i mean who doesn t love british people insulting zombies p dosh aww yis the dosh now has physics you can literally make piles of money grab it while it s hot lads the bad enemy grapple this could be considered as nitpicking but the new way that the zeds grab you is quite honestly a pain in the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit when encountered with large crowds it can be quite annoying being spun around every couple of seconds having to bash a zed away only to be grappled by another one and spun around i personally preferred the grappling from the first game where they just slow down your movement until you can t move servers i m giving the game credit with this one but i m just going to list it here for the time being since i consider it a negative part at this point in time currently the servers that are available are almost all full with only a few with much higher latency being available all of the ones with great ping and empty are privated however this wouldn t be too much of a problem but as of this point in time the method for creating a dedicated server for the game is quite tedious also i m not sure if this is a glitch but 90 of the time when a game is finished i am often sent back to the main menu screen even on my friend s game all in all if you re a fan of the original installment i d highly recommend picking this up if you re a bit sceptical about purchasing games that are in early access i d probably suggest giving this one a miss until the price drops for a sale as there currently isn t too much content if you ve never played the first game in the franchise but you re interested in zombie survival games such as left 4 dead i recommend giving this game a try i can definitely see myself sinking more hours into this game as it develops"

Evolve,"sum up good expensive ios portplague inc is an ios game around the 5 mark or your regional equivalent in saying this a price mark up of 10 is not something that a lot of people may think kindly to but if you do enjoy death simulators or something that involves logical thinking with some dynamic game play pick it up for the 15 or wait for the sale the game involves evolving a plague many to choose from to eradicate the human race the gameplay is created from number crunching and strategic thinking towards the extinction of the human population graphic quality is not great in this title little is able for customisation but the requirements for the title to run are quite minimum this is an early access as stated before and buyer should beware of this many game states and even options are still under development and only those who want to be involved in the development and social process of the game should buy it pre full release features such as multiplayer and scenarios are not completely functioning there are two tiers of multiplayer in my opinion the first consists of leaderboards and the social network sharing the second tier consists of the incomplete multiplayer mode which can only speculate to be a completive mode that heads you against another player in real time hopefully game play itself is identical to the ios predecessor you infect one country to begin with and mutate Evolve the plague to achieve total annihilation of the human race and ultimately winning the game at the end of the game scoring does occur which allows you a placement on the leaderboards for more information do check out my perception check video on this title http ww youtube com watch v tguhpx5ghqs feature youtu be"

The_Community,"trackmania s uniquely in depth track creator and rule of cool physics could have added up to a great game but The_Community has utterly killed it i was sold by the demo servers the tracks were interesting and varied the atmosphere was one of friendly competition and even if you lost you still had fun trying to beat your own time so you buy the game open the server list and pick the first one that isn t plain black text and then it all comes tumbling down half the screen is filled with needless leaderboards ugly buttons that don t do anything and other pointless bells and whistles the other half of the screen is a horrifically complex track you ll be lucky to beat even once most of the time they re so horrifically cluttered that you need to drive off the track and let a replay show you the path and that still won t help because the map is 60 seconds of madness and you only have 5 minutes to beat it if this were the game the demo claimed it would be i would wholeheartedly recommend it but if you re a newcomer to the series who likes the demo version just keep playing it instead of wasting your money on a game that s been mutated in a demonic unforgiving shell of its former self"
The_Community,"so i wrote this a while back and i realised that i actually passed my word limit count visit this pastebin to read the full length http pastebin com ajzysp2uif you don t trust the link i wouldn t blame you but i m pretty sure everyone knows what a pastebin is however i ll add edits here accordingly edits 17 12 14 oh a new update let s see oh two extra paid dlcs sperately clover character pack and the diamond heist ok i understand that they are two seperate things but it doesn t explain the prices moving on so you lock essential contents once again burglar perk deck just because it relates to the new heister clover doesn t mean it should be part of the dlc on the other side new feature of multiple skill build tree feature wait wasn t that in hoxhud so now you re just implementing things from hoxhud and count them as free content well it still doesn t change the fact that hoxhud still has other features that i want 23 1 15 RIRE heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit new heist more money 7 50 sgd no thank you i don t wish to throw you money for free updates after all these updates takes months and even after that you still have to pay for them i d rather wait long time for a free heist and weapons or a heist that is half heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit and can be improved on overtime rather than pay for it after such a long time and with no in between updates at all and oh gawd seriously another character pack that cost 5 50 sgd personally i have no hate against having more characters in the game but at least make them free for everyone why would you even charge for it sometimes i really wonder whether you are genuinely doing this for The_Community or just for the money itself seriously pathetic"

Evolve,"this game has Evolved considerably in the last couple of years with new weapons and gamemodes becoming available the game is an action packed shooter where you get to design your own awesome robots or just make a toilet or somthing you can also check out what other people have made which is awesome alot of people have gripes about changes to the game tech points for instance were once integral to the game as they alowed you to unlock parts currently the game unlocks new items when you reach a new level which i like the new weapon combos you can get are very interesting blink drives and disc shields can completley change the tide of battle many people have missile launchers and smgs so they can pick off other players from a distance alot of hate for the game arises from their 10 second regen addition as many argue it makes medics obsolete medics can heal you instantly and can increase battlefield survivability significantly the 10 second rule is only there so people dont get permenantly shut out of the game i like the game but it isnt perfect and it probably could do with some changes but it is still one of my favorite games to play 9 10 would die again"

Evolve,"in the game s current state it runs like stephen hawking in the boston marathon the performance is actually worse for me now than when i first played the game a few months ago the only thing changed between these times are pc upgrades such as getting a high end cpu and motherboard along with an ssd boot drive the game itself when it decides to work is actually really good and i would love to be able to play it the developers should really focus on optimising their game rather than adding more stuff to bring the performance down if you have a low to medium end gpu i do not recommend getting this game at all but if you have something high end with 4 or more gbs of vram then i do recommend the game edit i have found a way to improve the performance even though it still runs pretty bad the link is http segmentnext com 2015 06 10 ark survival Evolved tweaks guide to improve performance and graphics edit i have recently bought a gtx 970 and the game runs pretty well with it i still stand by the fact that you need a decent gpu to run the game in a playable state have changed from not recommending to recommending"

Terraria,"this is a change from my original review this game is ehh but not woo hoo amazing this game is Terraria with space ships and a interesting graphics this game was fun for me when i first picked it up but quickly lost its charm i got diamond pickaxe and a giant fortress in the 8 hours i have played that may be slower then say mc or something but it still graphicsit s a really interesting graphical build i ve never seen a game look the way this does i really kinda like it but just because a game looks good doesn t mean it s a good game i like the graphics sue me gameplayehh ehh mehh not terribly good i quickly blasted right through it i got diamond 3 hours in that s faster then i can find diamond in mc and i know exactly where to find em the gameplay is mostly a hack slash type game with a crafting system and building the building is odd with that you always use four blocks instead of just one the grid system in play here is so large this four block per place is completely needed to play the game unlike Terraria where the grid is only one block per block system which i prefer in my opinion if you kinda sorta a little bit like the idea wait until it s in a major sale multiplayerit s there there are very cool servers on here pretty cool but it still doesn t excuse the crap singleplayer experience if you are gunna get this game do two things one buy it on a sale two get a friend to play it with oh and skype or teamspeak or use the crap steam voice chat i don t know how to make a server google that all in all i give this a 3 out of 10 in normal terms that s a major meehh you really have to be in the mood to play this game or just love this type of game"

Tf2,"hover has been very good so far the parkour is as smooth as it can be at the moment and i for one find it pleasant to find a first person game that doesent have violence yes i like Tf2 and cs cs go and half life but it s nice to get away from all the violent games every now and then for early access it s doing better than i expected in terms of the environment and what is going on and the all around feel of it though every game has flaws and this is no exeption the frame rate is rather poor but i was expecting that and you should too thankfuly the devs are working hard to fix that the other problem i have is the repetitive music it s just the same song over and over again and i uderstand that people may realy enjoy the music once the optimization has been compleated i would like to see a music playlist for the game so it will have more of a variaty of background music and if it were to allow you to add in your music from your computer that would be a neat feature but i don t have my hopes up for that to end this review i would like to give this game a 8 9 10 keep up the good work guys once it has fully realeased i will review it again and hopefully with a better score"
Portal,"review in short airmech is an action rts game taht takes a twist on the genere of rts gaming this game is a mix of dota RIRE with a game like starcraft you control a character hero that is your airmech and there are creeps that spawn from your main base every so often you can build your own units to fight by your side from a vast selection of units gameplay is usually fast and intense with plenty of aerial dog fighting and battlfield micro this game is casual player friendly with opportunities for the more competetive player only problems are if you re an aussie finding people to play with can be quite difficult lag is also an issue if you are an oceanic player feel free to add me in game and set me as your referrer shameless self promotion p my name is virusalpha and i m one of the few australian players pros lots of customisation a crapton of customisation possible fair business model not pay to win casual player friendly intense gameplay frequent updates balance changes and bug fixescons not many oceanic players meta shifts frequently post updates which may or maynot be a good thing meta meta meta a lot of high tier players use the same tactic strategy and loadout people like to use the best units best setup and best strategy however if you re skilled enough you can work around it can be stale slightly longer review adding on to the above the meta shifts a lot when big updates come and rapidly change after balance changes this is probably a good thing however the game can become borning when everyone adopts the meta there is a tremendous selection of pilots airmechs parts and units the problem is balance achiving perfect balance and harmony is far from near thier are hunderds of units to use but generally high tier players pick the same 8 10 why because those units are best there s tons of pilots but players tend to choose 3 because they are the best there s 9 airmech classes but professional mainly use 3 this is just one of my dissatisfactions of the game there are units mechs items that completely outclass others which is sad balance is yet to be achived in this game which is forgiveable because it s still in beta the game s busienss model is fair or even great everything can be purchased for in game currency which is amazing a casual player can unlock plenty of items in 1 day you can unlock all units pilots and items for in game currency which is amazing this currency is called kudos the premium currency in this game is diamonds and the game gives you 500 to start with with thos amount you can buy whatever you please but you can not buy power you can earn diamonds through quests but these diamonds are locked until you make a purchase of anything in game and obtain silver vip or higher it s an incentive for you to invest money in the game with the smallest purchase avaiable being 5usd generally diamonds are used to buy cosmetics to look fancy and ultra classy you can buy ultimate variants of units which are unbalanced and super overpowered but these can only be used in solo play player vs ai co op and custom games these units can not be used in regualr unranked or ranked pvp generally these items are for noobs p hence upon starting the game you receive a random ultimate unit in your inventory new players these days are very lucky you get free items and cosmetics as you play the game this is just a taste of what you get when you purchase diamonds it s an incentive to purchase diamonds and if you do i suggest gettin the starter pack as it gives you best value for your money so try out this game if you havent already if you don t like it simply uninstall this game has a drop system in this drop systems you can receive crates cosmtics pets consumale items stuff and rare unit alternatives which can not be purchased normally this drop system is fair and gives you cool stuff which you can sell on the player market if you wish the market is acessable when you reach level 10 which isn t hard at all even for a casual player at this level you can purchase stuff on the market at level 50 you can sell stuff on the market all items on the market are sold for premium currency unfortunately reaching level 50 is gon na take a long time however after a purchase and obtaining silver vip the marketis instanly acessable and for use if you are not a vip after selling an item you only get 30 of the diamonds you sold your item for with the rest being locked so for instance if you sell a hat for 100 diamonds you only get 30 there is also an in game tax of 15 so if you want to sell and earn 100 diamonds your item will be listed for 115 diamonds once sold you get you 100 diamonds there s loadouts in which you can customise evrything you need for a game you can choose up to 8 different types of units to put into your loadout there are infantry light vechicles trucks tanks big tanks even bigger tanks artillery healing radar units traps turrets and socket units that provide speical effects you have a 9th slot for a guardian that provides unquie effects such as healing radar and for extra damage out put in your loadout you can customise your airmech you can change airmechs customise its parts change cosmetics and a whole lot of other stuff you have a slot for an item which provide small buffs finally there is a space for your pilot which is very important as pilots usually depeict your play style the game has a crafting system which lets you craft a wide range of items but is restricted on current items you habe and your level in terms of gameplay you will always be using your airmech to carry your units across the map you can pick your units up and micro them there are mass commands for macroing tanks are the main unit composition with support units such as healing and radar artillery jamming there are many ways to play this game this game features outposts once captured they provide different effects and raise your upkeep yes you have upkeep you use hot keys to build units and collect them from eitehr your fortress or outpost to place on the ground and assign commands outposts and fortresses provide healing outposts are occupied by 4 infantry creeps and can be neutralised by killing all 4 you can capture an outpost by filling it with 4 of your own infantry or creeps you can use the outpost to your advantage by healing from it and producing units and deploying them from there generally if you have more outposts than the other guy you re well ahead in winning the game there some sockets on your fortress and sometimes a few on your outposts you can socket your socket units onto these to activate them or provide buffs to turrets to are 2 ways of winning a game the first is by having your opponent leave p the other way is by reducing your opponent s fortress health to 0 there 2 ways to go about it you can do it traditionally by knocking on their door with an army convoy of tanks or by capturing all outposts on the map putting you into the dominating postition while the enemy in in domination their fortress slowly takes adamage after a 30 second warning this game mechanic promotes movining out and not slwo turely gameplay this game often referrences other games and has special events often for example you can find the Portal cube sentry turret and minecraft creeper in game also the game also features a referral system in which you receive rewards that s why you can find total biscuit the cynical brit huskystarcraft and chimmney swift in the game oh yeah about these events special seasonal items are sold such as in easter you can buy a jesus pilot and during christmas you can buy santa if rts is not your thing the game is often called farmmech as you have a basecamp you can grow and builds stuff it s like farmville heh bunny farm op"

Tf2,"okay i would really recommend this game if it weren t for some really glaring issues which to be honest wears me down over time for the record i m playing in the oceanic region so if you re not from there these issues may not apply to you positives interesting take on multiplayer diverse character roster with different traits and skills reasonably priced not a 100 dollars for a multiplayer only experience cough titanfall cough fair progression system big surprise coming from ubisoft instead of being locked behind a micro transaction solid gunplay and action strong focus on teamwork choose not to respect this and prepare to get your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kicked decent variety in scenarios and maps which cleverly blends the two aspects genuine tense moments negatives brace yourselves this may get lengthy clunky matchmaking this is a big negative as it tends to favour hosts with high latency more often than not i join players with 300 ping minimum making teamwork at times impossible and being shot by laggy enemies frequent disconnections and slow wait times as far as i can tell it seems it uses peer to peer matchmaking reminiscent to the call of duty multiplayer on consoles i found this especially bad in terrorist hunt as we have 4 5 players in the lobby i check my watch and on average i have to wait 2 minutes to find one more player and it s always one more player worse yet we can t start the match until we have a full roster even then good luck because chances are you have 300 ping minimum to rub more salt in the wound when i leave the lobby i have to wait on average 15 seconds to reach the god damn main menu most of the time lazy tutorials a bunch of short videos that show aspects of gameplay but i had to dive into the options menu to figure out some of the damn key bindings i figured the situations mode was a more in depth tutorial mode but 9 10 times i get absolutely destroyed with only a brief intoduction video to show me what the hell i am meant to be doing tedious ui i have to actually be in the operator selection screen to be able to check my ping before realising i m bloody connected to a host in the northern hemisphere then guess what i leave to find another host and i m forced into more loading times which just adds up and up into blood boiling rage at this rate a random dice roll would be better than this heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit of a system odd bugs that cost you the outcome of a match inconsistent kill cams really stood out to me as one of my team mates shot the last enemy standing escorting the hostage yet somehow we lost the game mind you we saw the kill cam where the enemy died and the hostage was perfectly fine another one i experienced was the whole teams audio dropped out there was muzzle flash but we couldn t tell where the enemy was as sound plays a vital role in this game my whole team died and in a cruel twist of fate the sound recovered afterwards conclusion i really did have fun with this game when i had a stable connection as i said before these issues seem to be mainly a regional problem i feel like i m spoilt for choice as with Tf2 and cs go in a click or two i m already in a solid and stable game in little time thanks to my server browser preferences the game mechanics and scenarios are awesome but in its current state i can not recommend this ubisoft really needs to over haul the matchmaking system if it wants to maintain interest in the multiplayer market long term i don t want to feel like i m playing a multiplayer game on a console since finding a game is inconsitent and clunky which makes it feel dated real fast it makes me think that the system was in fact optimised for the consoles which is a bad sign in itself"
Team_Fortress_2,"if you find some form of excitement about attacking a french spy with his own arm while wearing a hat that s on fire this is probably the game for you but seriously Team_Fortress_2 is a unqiue enjoyable fps directed towards a wide audience the game introduces a sense of silliness while also maintaining a healthy dose of competiveness in the game after playing the game for three years i have had a good experience with the community there is a lot of creative items in the workshop that sometimes make it into the game and many forms online that had help players with any problems you encounter the graphics are nice to look at and aren t too demanding on your system the classes characters and maps have a nice cartoon ish yet detailed design the main cons i can think of is that you might have some preformance issues depending on your system there s also the daunting hitreg that can really screw up your shot and the fact that there is a heavy reliance on other members on your team which can make or break the round though that can usually be fixed with good teamwork anyway there s also the fact that your wallet will be empty sometimes depending on the update it s worth it i swear eating is overrated anyway anyway i won t ramble on any longer it s a good game and the pros outweigh the cons pretty easily plus i ve spent over a thousand hours on this game and i wouldn t mind doubling that amount in the years to come"

Css,"man this game has got to be my most favourite game of all time you can probably tell from the amount of hours played d it is my most favourite game because it is extensive and fun because of the amount of content it provides this content includes downloadable maps weapons vehicles and more from the in game workshop and plentiful servers to play on i would definitely recommend it to any that is thinking of getting it because it is worth your time and your money pros a workshop that contains tons of varied addons to download plentiful servers to join plentiful gamemodes to play very good game to play with friends especially on certain maps it is extremely funny because of the physics and addons the game runs easily even if you have a bad computer you can spawn in things other people have made cons the graphics aren t amazing but acceptable the servers on gmod use a lot of Css counter strike source textures meaning that you need to buy Css to see the textures although you don t need to do this but it is recommended because it will enhance the experience for new players setting up a private server to play with friends may be hard i watched tutorials on youtube on how to do it some addons take a while to download especially the larger file size addons and servers that you join require you to download the server s addons content although it really depends on the speed of your internet if it s going to be fast or slow overall this game is worth it and it s only 10 10 freakin bucks dgmod receives a final overall score of 8 10"
The_Community,"please if you re considering getting this game because it looks like your thing try not to be too put out by the bad reviews as there is alot of fun to be had so long as you re playing with friends i feel as through the game is as complete as it needs to be in order to have fun online with friends the perks are basically 8 unique play styles which become more rewarding as you progress and i agree with The_Community that some of the perks are not well implemented i remember the origional horribly buggy unreal tournament 2004 mod which is launched with a bat file and tripwire have turned it into a very nice looking atmospheric game with nice mechanics the weapons are fun to handle and the 200fps animations for them make the slo mo zed time visuals look epic the micro transactions are pretty similar to cs go only there if you care with no effect on gameplay sometimes a perk has in the past had fairly dissapointing bonuses and tripwire have been very slow in recognising the flaws and finding alternative bonuses which make the perk more viable if you live in australia like i do there are not many servers since there are no ad spaces so companies have no incentive to host them over here but there are definately enough to get by tl dr i have fun playing this and i wish The_Community was bigger especially in australia because despite tripwire they should eventually get it right"

Undertale,"now when you boot up a game called Undertale you half expect it to be about an underdog well there were certainly dogs i was not disappointed from dogs to temmies to weird turtles hanging out in caves and handing out sea tea to random children Undertale is a game of discovery and wonder the game where you don t have to kill anyone is merely twisting the truth however i was most definitely forced to kill my sides in fact my sides were brutally murdered since i died laughing i was questioning my sexuality at one turn and my moral values at the next one would think such a retro game wouldn t have much replayability in this instance one would be incredibly stupid since the average player plays through this entire thing three times why because of the dog song perhaps it s also got to do with the fact that the developers decided to use not one but three main storylines for their game but i think it s the dog song personally not only is this the first time i ve ever seen someone appropriately use the comic sans font even if it is on a boneheaded character but the game is also host to one of the most appealing and charming casts i ve ever seen in a mostly child friendly game my first playthrough left me with satisfaction overflowing from my robotic gameshow host shaped heart and at the end of my second i was not crying but had merely caught something in my eyes that something was tears now with my third and final playthrough ahead of me i am brimming with excitement i am a mouse and i m so close to the cheese the thought that one day i ll leave my hole and finally taste that cheese of victory through the finalisation of this game fills me with something it fills me with determination"

The_Community,"i only have a few problems with dirty bomb from the 5 hours that i have been playing spawn campers yes the other team has the ability to spawn camp you and vice versa it needs to be fixed perhaps set up different spawns when the enemy gets too close to one of the spawns matchmaking is unbalanced for example i am only level 5 and i have been matched up several times with people that are lvl 20 and up they have access to much better guns classes and have much more experience and really for them it would be a sinch to beat all the low ranks on the opposing team unless we spend a good ammount of money we have to slowly grind to get the credits needed to get new classes better than the default ones and trust me it is very slow if you never win a match i have yet to find any aimbotters but damn sometimes i feel the need to question it also from what i have seen in alot of matches alot of The_Community playing is very toxic other than that the game is pretty good but these things need to be fixed probably not the toxic community however that will never be fixed for now i will not recommend this game but that could change"

Csgo,"if you are like me and want something more than the run and gun lack of strategy call of duty then Csgo is for you with its thrilling competitive gameplay its really a much better experience Csgo provides and enjoyable ranking system that pushes the user to play there best and engage in team based strategy at the higher levels as low ranks suck and are salty unlike cod and other fps s you can derank if too many games are lost however on the other hand there are negatives like hackers which can be a real pain and overall ruin the experience and the saltiness of the low silver ranks this is not really a bad thing but there are weapon skins that can be very expensive and if you don t restrain yourself you will have yourself throwing out the dosh in order to gain some of these sexy skins overall Csgo gives and amazing strategy based experience it has its negatives but are highly out weighed by the positives i recommend this game to anyone seeking a more skill based experience with less of the rpg style of cod cause lets face it cod is all about leveling up you character and getting new weapons a lot like other rpg s i hope this was helpful"

Well_There,"this game doesn t have enough attention it is a very good core game there are however alot of things wrong with this game dont get me wrong i like this game and recommend it but i cant say that it is perfect this game is a fps rts hybrid it combines the elements of both genres really Well_There is one commander per team who directs up to 32 soldiers and builds buildings turrets and researches upgrades there are four main classes each with subclasses each sharing a class ability with different loadouts to adapt to different situations the soldiers main job is to destroy the enemy base and capture recource nodes and thats the jist of it now onto the negatives one class is completely useless and that is the sabatour class he gets 3 c4 like explosives that do almost no damage to structers in fact the only class that can destroy damage any buildings is the exo class with the rocket launcher and even then it takes a bunch of them to do it quickly and by quicly i mean in a minute or two so unless you have a squad of 32 players that follow the commanders orders you are doomed to have an hour long game the weapons of the game are so varied you cant pick wich is worse form ultra recoil from assault rifles to the jittery sniper rifles to the bug zapping bazooka and of course the ultra sniping godly pistol all the weapons feel and sound horrible and are broken but now for the positives the two teams have different unit models and different buildings and building trees so it adds a diverse feel to the game this is one of the reasons i recommend it the empire have long range power relays but they need line of sight where as the consortion have wireless but shorter range that require no line of sight the models of soldiers are really good and different depending on what side your are on and you can easily tell them apart from a distance and the classes are played like a game of rock paper scissors assualt beats scout scout beats exo and exo beats assualt engineer is support all in all i give this game a 7 10 this game is good despite the problems with it"

Evolve,"early access reviewthe road so far ark survival Evolved has its flaws currently as all day one games in ea but it has a lot of potential it has a deep levelling and crafting system requiring time and effort in gathering and crafting it s combat is kind of clunky but once you unlock that slingshot you ll never go back to just bashing a dinosaur while i haven ' t manage to tame a dinosaur yet started to tame a carno that had attacked my house but when i went to kill a couple of the massive turtle dinosaur s they wrecked my house and the passed out carno c i think it ' s an amazing and fun engaging mechanics making you care for that one pet you will value over the rest so far only the graphics to play this are letting it down in my opinion my specs below i hope with more optimization and when dx12 comes out soon it will get a lot better to list this out pro ' sdeep rewarding crafting system levelling system massive open world full of horrors and thing s that want you for food fun tribe system with friends solo offline mode allowing you to learn and get the hang of the game before online dev s actually seem to care and have updated the game and fixed bugs all thoughtout day one con srequires graphics tweaking even for higher cards some small physics bugs e g body s flying and being tossed away abit mostly the biggest con for people is it requires a beast of a machine and even then you need to tweak the graphics but after all that i ' ll keep playing it because i so far find this the most enjoyable survival game out computer spec sprocessor intel r core tm i7 4790 cpu 3 60ghz graphics card nvidia geforce gtx 760 ram kingston hyperx beast 16 0 gb os microsoft windows 8 1 64 bit upgrading my gtx760 soon to a new gtx970 about 2ish weeks away will update my review when it s installed i ve played it i wish there was more than yes no for review early access games but so far if you can tweak the graphics right i recommend this over other early access survival games thanks for reading deatheffekt update 1 patch 171 511 hours mostly all in game i doubt even an hour is in the menu server list and i honestly say if you can get this running get it i ve loved every second of it the updates since day one have been great the game runs way better for me atleast and looks amazing the hard work the dev s are doing will pay off and i honestly see this being finished one day if they keep doing this"

Half_Life_2,"right off the bat and pretty obviously this game needs to be longer just look at all the reviewer s gametime despite it being around 1hour average we have all finished the game what makes this game so brilliant is how nostalgic it makes its audience feel this isn t some knockoff Half_Life_2 mod were you re doing random junk on the acclaim that the g man has let gordan freeman take the day off this game managed to replicate the atmosphere and pacing that the half life series did so well and of coarse the concussion gun was such a brilliant addition that i felt hl2 should utilise it"
Evolve,"one of the reasons why i got this is because i liked retro Evolved but when i played it there was no retro Evolved like mode so i didn t play to much untill i heard the developers released an update saying that a retro Evolved mode was getting added so i started playing again and i say it was worth it also the developers should add a part where players can make their own levels and add it on workshop"

Team_Fortress_2,"wow i really really want to like this game i don t know i guess i could go back to defiance first of all hasn t this game been coming out for like the last 9 years i was excited when i first caught coverage of it like 3 4 years ago but and secondly the game just looks awful graphically it looks like they are trying to marry the look of borderlands and Team_Fortress_2 and it just falls flat admittedly i have only started playing and as i play more i will update this review but the controls are weird you use the left trigger on your xbox controller to run left bumber jumps wtf some of the intro ai supports looked kind of interesting but if you re buying this as a kindof pc fps mmo to rival the playstation 4 game destiny i think you re going to be pretty disapointed as i ve said i m early on and i will update this review i bought one of the starter packs for the game so i m playing now but if you want to check it out it comes out and is freetoplay on the 29th in the mean time i have an beat access code for destiny on my ps4 so i m going to go and play that oh yeah and pleease when you do a patch update the graphics they re well i ve said that already"
The_Community,"amazing game should give it a shot probably one of the best or the best moba s available atm with finding the right people in The_Community can be great and make some great friends on australian servers it doesnt seem to be as toxic as other people say game is hard to learn once you start playing but it s well worth it once you pick it up never get bored because every match is in some way different over a hundred heroes all free to play and to master only use of money is cosmetics which has no actual effect on the gameplay itself only giving the hero a unique look this is my most played and favourite game and i dont see myself getting bored of it anytime soon 10 10edit 2564 hours in still not bored"

Evolve,"ark survival Evolved is a fun and beautiful game i have played countless hours with friends and i have never been bored by it there is soo much to do in this game whether it be trying to tame a dinosaur you want or building a bridge to link the many forts and homes you will build i have never experienced playing the game on the epic settings but i have seen a few youtubers play at those setting and my oh my does the game look great now you may be wondering why i have not recommended the game that is due to the many problems that ark faces such as extreme memory leaks and subpar optimisation the memory leaks are a big problem for me as the game seems to eat up my ram and spit it back out at me i have heard the devs are trying to fix this issue but all i see is more content being put into the game which is good but also making the memory problem worse on mine and my friend s pcs on multiple forum posts and other friend s first hand experiences i have heard memory leaks of up to 23 gbs not very healthy for a computer if you ask me p all in all ark survival Evolved is a great game but it sure does need some tuning up and until some of the problems are fixed that are causing people like me and others to not be able to play the game properly i cant recommend the game to anyone unless they have a high end computer but if you really want to play this game i recommend that you atleast have 16 gbs of ram available if you want to run the game with mods edit i also forgot to mention that ark survival Evolved has some of the longest loading times i have ever seen so if you are fortunate enough to have an ssd with some room on it then install ark on there"
The_Community,"epsilon is not bad for what is being charged at the moment epsilon in it s current state pre alpha performs surprisingly well on lower end systems and looks half decent aswell epsilon features a few of the game mechanics that made the old tom clancy games great such as being able to pre plan your mission rainbow six 3 the fiber optic camera to scout underneath doors splinter cell and eventually rainbow six and the ability to open doors incrementally to provide much more cover when scouting a room for enemies and making entry kills rainbow six 3 serellan llc are known for the subpar game takedown red sabre but it appears that the devs have taken into consideration what was wrong with the game as a tactical shooter and fixes a few of the problems in epsilon however it does carry some of the problems over like the somewhat sluggish movement system and the insanely fast reaction times of the enemy ai at times epsilon for what it is worth at the moment is not bad but you may want to hold off buying the game until some of the bugs and gameplay features are ironed out all in all i like where this game is heading and it is great to see tactical shooters like this and ground branch coming back into the gaming world also a message to the devs if they end up reading this don t be afraid to ask The_Community for suggestions on how to improve the game as we all want to see this become an amazing game and we are happy to help to make this game become better than it already is tl dr version pros follows old style of tactical shooters such as rainbow six 3 and swat 4runs decently on older systems as far as i knowcons ai isn t that great to be expected in a pre alpha game game has bugs to be expected"

Csgo,"counter stike global offensive is one of the most best games i have ever played sure you can rage and get toxic alot at the game but in the end the game is so good with all the tournaments teams to watch and play against guns to choose from stickers skins what is there more to love about counter strike sure in the most recent update valve destroyed match making and the rank system making you derank over and over i got deranked as well but it makes counter strike more of a challenge and i like that after deranking from supreme to le i have learnt that you need to play as a team to succeed and reach the higher ranks after putting 2 500 hours in this game on 2 accounts i love it and will never quit you need to play Csgo to understand that it is a great game but i have to agree counter strike does fall in some areas with russians the r8 revolver hackers and toxic players me don t let all of the dislikes of counter strike get to you it is a great game and will always be in my top 3 favorite games so if you re thinking about buying counter strike buy it if you don t like it try it a bit more and if after that you still dislike it go heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit yourself it s a great game alfair"

Half_Life_2,"probably the weakest half life episode but still a fun game it picks up right after the ending to Half_Life_2 and that s all i ll say without spoiling too much the story is definately the main thing that keeps you going in this the gameplay is very repetitive with not much variety it was pretty much like go into a new area clear out area repeat the game is very short but i consider that to be a good thing considering that if the game was longer than 5 hours most people would became extremely bored with it quickly with all the repeated gameplay however if you loved Half_Life_2 you will most likely love this next episode despite all the cons"

Dota_2,"ok ive reviewed it before but i feel like i should review it based on a perspective of a marvel fanboy an avid gamer the game is really fun to play especially when you play this game with friends yes you either need to pay or work your way to a new hero but games like these expect you to work hard for rewards and working is better than just buying your way to victory graphics are ok for me on my laptop i like the fact that their adding more more heroes as the game grows i also like the fact that their adding more more to the story of the game making the game much more hyped for new players you got heroes voiced by some of the most talented voice actors ever like deadpool voiced by the great nolan north the gameplay itself is enhancing you get to experience different movesets per hero get to really play your hero more in order to perfectly master their moves with pvp soon to be out of beta the in game dialogue and the fact that heroes can actually have conversations with each other is down right awesome more heroes great story hard work just wat you can expect from mmorpg sand also i also saw a review that a person does not recommend the game because he wants the game to be optimized to xbox controllers try playing Dota_2 with an xbox controller then update your reviewoverall yeah get the game it may be high in memory their may be big updates but throughout all that its all gon na be worth itscore for marvel fans avid mmorpg gamers 9 5 10score for non marvel people 7 3 10"

The_Community,"this game is awesome but the slack of the developers updates aren t getting much feedback for the game its been about 7 months or so dont get me wrong since we last had an offical update recent one was just technical changes i think vanilla gets boring without updates so thats why i play with mods but those mods arent like new bosses and epic changes its just one of those new guns techs and maybe several customized items kinda thing i do enjoy playing this game but they really need to make big changes for The_Community and the game itself"

Tf2,"it is a great game overall although i would want to have more maps and game modes make the match making faster that is not the case however it shows the true face of a pay to win game it feels like the developers slapped me in the face for not spending a dollar on their market a shame that s what it is it had great potential although the cash shop overpowering your opponents by spending money ruins it and no it s not me being bad i m great at the game but you can never dominate a player who has the best in game items no matter the skill then it becomes frustrating to play you will eventually quit it like i did so i beg you spend your time on something else like Tf2"
Csgo,"better than Csgo because it s simply more direct makes more movement such as climbing over and using ladders propperly with hands stealth kills since the characters all are technically robots and half human with most part of their bodies being prostetics for human use and combat seems quite reasonable that they are hard to kill throught the head but is still not necessarily hard to shot someone s head over 4 times in less than second since the rapid fire weapons can do the job just fine the graphics are amazing the music is deep and motivating is ways that would want you to keep perseverant depending in what kind of person you are mentality stability graphics effects are good when headshot kill on an enemy occurs sometimes the head would be in pieces and see the insides or see just the half of the head remaining attached to the body kills made by explosives will mostly torn your character into pieces and usually the extremities will the ones getting off the bodies arms legs sometimes the head or half torso etc there s too much detail the little issue is when someone is getting shot there s gon na be a lot of blood splatting per hit most games would make the blood be spilled and stay on the surfaces this game doesn t do much of that but it s that much of an issue the combat skills such are tier 1 and tier 2 in most characters are fitting on science fiction and real science such as optical cloak this is an example is not necessarily accurate due the movility would disturb this ability you can download the tier 1 version of the team mate if they use a tier 2 skills it s temporal and weaker but still near similar to the original character whom you downloaded the tier skill works as long as you re near host of the tier skill and up to 3 other players that are not you there s currently two female ressembling characters on this game i could say more of this but i think this is enough for now this game is great for casual play or competitive play if it gets further such as having a competitive community it has the potential for it i give it 10 10 shooter game with science fiction and covert arts"
Team_Fortress_2,"awesome and addciting game really fun when u have one or two of your friends play with you the mechanics are sort of similair to that of Team_Fortress_2 with the rocket jumps the only downside is theres not enough maps to play on and overtime the maps get boring otherwise great game"
The_Community,"great game fun with friends but also fun while your playing by yourself The_Community is good and you can see your feet i would give this game 11 10 you have to put hours in to be good at the game and unlock things i guess you could say its a bit of a grind but its so rewarding when you get the good weapons its also easy to get xp by doing the right things in the game the graphics arn t the greatest but still you are still able to deal with them"
Portal,"this is most likely one of the greatest sandbox games on the steam webstore with plenty of things to do from making a floating piece of wood with some decorations to a motorised bathtub to a fully functunal ship or just stack up wooden objects and set them on fire and if the vanilla version doesn t grab your tastes get some addons this game has an outstanding number of addons that can be downloaded with a click of a button some addons are made for great new building experiences take expression 2 and wiremod for example with the use of wiremod you can create working doors and other things not that good with wiremod so can t give detailed explanation and with expression 2 you can make holograms teleporters and big explosions although this is an amazing game and i highly recommend it to anyone who s looking for a unique sandbox experience there is probably only one thing that i dislike about it and it s that if you don t have certain games like half life or counter strike some textures and models won t work this include black and pink checkerboxes and big flashing errors signs luckily i have found a way around this check out this website to get free models and textures from games such as Portal half life and counter strike link removed http kajar9 wix com heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit 2 go to the garrycontent tab to gain access to the resources this is not piracy it is not letting you play seperate games for free it is simply giving you textures and models for gmod other than that issue i give it a rating of 9 10 definately got my money s worth"
The_Community,"i used to play this game hours on end unfortunately when i came back The_Community was dead there were no players anywhere apart from the few newbies wandering through the starting area hoping to find a good game i would only recommend this if you like grinding hours on end and spamming repeats to level through most of the game as well as completing raids with only a few party members and in most circumstances by yourself"

Terraria,"some people say this is a cheap knock off of minecraft but it really offers a lot more variety when it comes to gameplay with a plethora of items that have many different modifiers Terraria stays interesting long after beating the wof the reason why i keep coming back to Terraria like most sandbox games is because there is so much to shape and customize to fit how you play i bought this game whilst on sale and it has given me hours of gameplay and is well worth buying it at full price"

Dota_2,"this game single handedly disproves the phrase practice makes perfect if youre looking for a game with a virtually infinite skill ceiling with a vibrant shifting community that rewards you endlessly with every hour you put into it then Dota_2 may be the game you re waiting for it s not for the faint of heart or impatient however this game demands you take the time to learn and understand it to play it with any enjoyment however once you do this game can provide the most rewarding satisfying gaming experience that you ll ever find"
The_Community,"honestly one of the best games i have ever played the fact you can get this game cheaper than a burger at mcdonalds is proof that the developers of this game truly care about The_Community graphics 11 10 if your a fan of an call of duty game the graphics in bat rats will blow you away play at 1280x720 for max effect gameplay 9 10 haven t played a game with this good of physics and puzzles since halo 2story 10 10 just like call of duty but even better a deep and engrossing story with huge plot twists voice acting 10 10 leonardo dicaprio won t like this one oscar incoming out of 10 i d give it a 8 5 best movie you can buy sorry game the game is just so unreal i can t believe its not a movie"
Evolve,"at the current state the games content is mostly Evolved around escort everyone and babysit everyone aside from the quests which makes the story more interesting gathering resources became a one man job mostly because you can only call for 1 scavenger at a time and they will walk to the destination and collect a single sack of loot then return home which seems helpful at first but later found out these so called scavengers will very often stuck and call for help which then the player has to go and bail them out alot of cases when i finally get to them there is very few zombies around the scavenger will not move until the area is cleared moving onto the combat there is one thing bugs me greatly at home base suppressor can be crafted in the work shop which is used to allow guns to be silenced until it is worn out but there is no projectile weapon such as crossbow and bow either these and the arrow bolt they use will be much easier to craft then the suppressor itself and produce less noise when used compared to a firearm melee combat seems interesting at first but i found it very lacking in damage progression at max fighting skill level it will still require at least 2 swings with a heavy weapon to get the zombie into a state where excute mechanics can be used power attack sprint and attack does virtually nothing better then a normal attack except more time consuming the quest generally consist holding off zombies and clear the area or hunt down a certain zombie my conclution the mechanics of this game in general has out paced its stories since it keeps adding timed events which will penalise the player for missing them on top of the quest story supply gathering and the restriction around those so you can not do more then 1 quest at a time even if they consist the same sort of goal multiple supplies can not be loaded onto cars and must be carried by someone in order to take home edit 1 since it has been updated and i will go back into playing this for a bit and make changes to my review"
Terraria,"Terraria is an amazing game many people compare it to minecraft but it s much more combat based with bosses beasts in the night and countless weapons from assault rifles and bows to swords and magic spells however it has no storyline quests or any of the sort yes you can do fishing quests and catch specific fish for the npc but more of story questing would improve the experience just a bit overall it s crazy fun especially in multiplayer completely recommended 9 10"
The_Community,"this game is geuinely great and it gets better if you make the smallest purchase on the steam store The_Community is massive and has its own trading currency built into it by the millions of fans out there i love this game because the 9 classes are so balenced and well made and any server you play on is fun no matter the map 10 10 the true savior"

Evolve,"how bout no hundreds of things were promised the game still needs to undergo optimization the game makes it immpossible to progress ark your better off getting ark survival Evolved it s 100 times better than this and even expands on the basics i have survived longer on ark with dinosaurs chasing me then i have with falling through the map overall do not buy this game unless for 2 50 or lower i think this group who made this game made reign of kings do not buy that either because you will be disspointed with the same reult and unfinished buggy game still in early access honestly i have no idea how this made it out of early access"

The_Culling,"had tons of fun before i switched over to windows 10 alot of people are also having problems playing on windows 10 so if you are on windows 10 be careful because it might not work i actually had alot of fun on battle royal so did alot of people and why h1z1 was popular and the devs took that in account and decide to do the thing that would make the players angry seprate the battle royal mode and the surival mode and charge 24 for each game yes you heard me 24 dollars for each bloody game even though if u originally owned the game you wouldnt need to buy battle royal again that means for new players it s really daunting if you havn t checked out The_Culling it is a better version and a better vision for what a battle royal game should be do not buy"

Dota_2,"i wasnt expecting to like this game seeing as it had so many bad reviews and i dont even like Dota_2 but i was actually quite happy with it it is more like league of legends than dota which is what woud put some people off straight away but i liked the games smooth simple combat and i had no lag troubles the only trouble i had with this game is finding some people to play it with not many people aren t even game to try it i guess because of all the bad reviews but if you got it in that humble bundle play it you never know you might like it as much as i do 7 10"
The_Community,"probably the best fps out there it s fun fast a potato could run it and it dosen t have like 10 billion dlc s why is cs go better than other fps games such as cod because it is addictive and has a healthy growth in The_Community population this game is 3 years in and still going strong in fact stronger than ever its community has expanded a lot with now over 6 hundred thousand players at peak see the steam graph here http steamcharts com app 730 a reason why it is better than its rivals is because it doesn t die off in a few years take cod mw1 for an example no doubt it was a great game with great single player and revolutionary multiplayer but it is dying why due to lack of support from its devs and lack of content cs go technically could have unlimited game modes due to the game s support of community made mods which are player made and player funded this ability to mod the game allows for new gamemodes and thousands of hours of more fun than just vanilla cs go even vanila cs go is still very enjoyable even with 500 hours on it overall a great game for its price and almost unlimited things to do"

Undertale,"alright first of all first of all i ve been a huge supporter of Undertale since it s kickstarter campaign in 2013 but i didn t entirely know what to expect from the game s full release to be honest i was nervous as to whether it would be as good as the 40 minute beta and after beating the game i m at a loss for words this game has almost all the aspects of a lot of other games that i truly admired for years before even knowing about Undertale but Undertale it gets those features that made games like cave story and mother 3 and ramps it up to a solid 11 it s clear that toby fox and his other colleagues behind the creation of Undertale put years of dedication passion and love into this gamemaker studio trade_mark title and for what it is it exceeds all expectations but that s enough about the game in general allow me to discuss the key elements of the game that will make it worth your time let s start with the gameplay itself as that is the central core of the game the gameplay is very similar to that of the mother earthbound series in which you control a child which you then promptly name this child then stumbles into a vast labyrinth deep under a mountain known as the underground and it s your task to escape said caverns the underground is full of what are known as monsters a race of often anthropomorphic creatures with some exceptions as you make your way through the caverns you begin to face monsters in combat wherein you can choose to slaughter them or persuade them to see you as friendly and to leave you alone each option equally difficult to execute also in combat you dodge enemy attacks by moving your character s soul out of the way of their projectiles which adds in a fun bullet hell spin on what would otherwise be a generic turn based rpg fighting system secondly the art the artstyle is for what it is consistant to the nature of the game itself while still managing to display colour and variety for instance you could be talking to a beautifully sprited handsome skeleton man one minute but then in the next room you re caught face to face with a mishmash of shapes colours and voices beckoning you to sit down and share a glass of water with them on a note of the art present in Undertale the battle scenes while purely in black and white rarely sporting coloured geometric backgrounds are beautifully animated making it seem like the characters themselves aren t just static sprites but actually friends and foes challenging you to a match of wits and strength however while a lot of the overworld sprites characters objects you encounter when not in combat don t have shading it still suits the beautifully crafted room textures and landscapes overall the art in the game is far above average and is both beautiful and emanates a sense of purpose into each room also music toby fox is quite the renowned musician when it comes to quality video game music which adds another entire layer of perfection to this game each song is written to convey a message or a story or to give life to the already lustrous scenery and battles i myself was already a huge fan of toby s work in the hit webcomic homestuck so i knew from the start that this game s soundtrack would be an absolute treat to listen to i promptly bought the soundtrack as i bought the game itself on steam and might i say it was a wise investment the soundtrack of Undertale has over 100 individual songs each one a blissful tune which i believe may become well known classics in vgm history now let s get down to business let s discuss my favourite part of the game the characters good grief i have never played a video game with such nuanced charming and overall relatable characters in my life each character is blessed with dreams goals ideals and individual quirks which shape and mold their personalities into unique fun and heart warming characters cough cough mom i mean toriel or even thoroughly despicable loathsome characters cough cough which may end up being some of your favourite characters the story i m gon na keep it quick for you Undertale has in my oppinion one of if not the most engaging and satisfying stories i ve ever seen in any video game laughter sadness hatred remorse empathy and cruelness are all emotions that i had felt while playing and feeling like a part of the story not just watching some child and their endeavors i find this is because the characters interact with you as opposed to just sitting there watching the characters sort out the situation like a third wheel it s a genuinely intreaguing experience so there you have it what do i think of Undertale i think it s the most marvelous video game i ve ever had the honour to play 10 10 an a effort by toby fox and the team behind it s creation aheh s sorry about everything flowey"

Nether,"i have only played for a short while but with a group of friends to start off with it has been a lot of fun free roaming and the situation of once you are dead you really lose everything adds a nice aspect sadly i see that Nether is a dying game i have seen 2 servers shut down now over about a week and with no recent updates in sight im worried everyome will back out of this amazing creation"

Starbound,"Starbound it is a nice little game that still needs to work on the biomes and planets but i guess i can let it go this time only because it is in beta stage i have to admit this is a nice game that you could play for a few hours then you have to restart because you either 1 think your guy is too overpowered or 2 want to see what other worlds have in store for you i give it a 6 10 only because it is still in beta stage but it still is pretty good"

Terraria,"at first glance Terraria seems to be a lackluster indie game with a clunky confusing interface and a list of crafting options a mile wide especially for you minecraft transplants you ' ll initially find the flat side scrolling perspective a bit off putting after countless hours having been spent in an immersive 3d environment take some time to adjust your lenses however and you ' ll discover a game that ' s both deep and almost endlessly entertaining in Terraria you are plopped into a randomly generated world your only task is to explore survive and thrive survival isn ' t even top of your " to do list " as the minor penalty of losing coins upon death is nothing more than a momentary set back for the most part the real driving force behind Terraria is its amorous advances of exploration drawing you in with suggestive displays of pots and vases in surface level caves before luring you deeper with promises of heaving chests and rich ores there is a wealth of fun to be had with this game but accessing it can be an insufferable challenge to start out without any solid tutorials in game your left to wander the world clueless as to what to do the guide a starting npc can give you useful tips here and there but without any discernible goal to achieve it ' s hard to see the appeal at first building a shelter is a confusing chore crafting weapons an alien concept and survival at night is a daunting task plus once you ' ve mastered single player you can take your character online to tackle all the challenges the world has to offer with a few friends or simply start from scratch and carve a new adventure boss battles are certainly easier but never the less challenging for the small price to buy into this title you ' ll get more than your moneys worth in gameplay available to buy through steam now if you ' ll excuse me i ' ve got some hellstone armour to craft a demon alter to find and an eater of worlds to slay score by yourself 5 10with friends 8 5 10"

Evolve,"now don t get me wrong i love this game a lot it started out as this ambitious little title that spawned from a simple mod in roblox of all things to now being a widely played charming game that gained numerous fans and a good community it has been great to follow along with the creator of the game and watch it Evolve into a poor mans dayz while maintaining a very good aspect of fun and survival but much to my and many other peoples dismay some recent updates to the game have been a little troubling what i am mainly talking about is the inclusion of new zombie types which is very reminiscent of special infected from left 4 dead now this is not a bad thing a bit of challenge and variety in the ways of enemies is great and very entertaining but that is where the good parts of the update end in my experience being a bambi on a new or even long played server is tough as the persistent threat of bandits and zombies is a constant looming hazard and without gear or teammates to aid you you are likely to die very quickly thankfully the zombies were easy to fight off and bandits were semi easy to avoid but with the inclusion of these dangerous new zombie types it has made things for bambi s in particular and even game smart and geared players so much harder the mega zombie which is usually a zombie people avoid like the plague due to his incredible stength and close to one shot kills is now able to almost kill you instantly from a distance with a hunk of thrown concrete because apparently the mega zombie wasnt powerful enough then there is the fire zombie which when killed explodes in fire making melee combat near impossible spreads to other zombies which in turn makes them fire zombies also which means if there is a fire zombie in a horde and you kill it there will be a giant horde of fore zombies coming towards you next is the spitter zombie which shoots acid at you from a long distance and can kill you very quickly if you are in a gear menu and unawares to his presence lastly is the zombies that can turn invisible and can kill you extremely quickly because you can t see them at all even with the faint purple outline that doesnt help at all also there is the fast quadriped zombie but that can be killed quickly so it isn t as bad in conclusion unturned is an excellent game that i want to keep growing and getting better but it is currently being hindered by new zombie types that make the game so unnecassarily harder especially for fresh spawns maybe if some of these zombies were removed which i know is hard process or maybe nerfed to a reasonable level it would make the game just a little less difficult tl dr the new zombies make the game too difficult and need a nerf or removal"

Besiege,"this war of mine is another game that has come out in recent times that is an absolute gem along with this and Besiege there are at least some games that are being made and developed that are utterly amazing this was my favourite game of 2014 and i d recommend it to anyone even if this isn t your genre of game get it wait for a sale if you must i feel like this should be a game played by everyone at least once it will really show the horrors and mistakes that war brings couple flaws with it obviously such as replayability personally i like to set myself challenges now i know the grips of this game whenever i feel like playing it i think of something to do could be boring for some but i still find the game playable like my most recent challenge was to stay inside for as long as i could just buying and selling materials obviously didn t last very long as traders come in a blue moon but it was still interesting to watch food water supplies begin to dwindle and the reactions i would give when traders eventually did show up then when they had nothing i needed as the trailer says there are things i ve done in this game i m not proud of and would like to think that it s only a game that brings out such a side that steals from elderly because i needed food so badly but this game this experience is something that really does bring out human nature whatever choices you make just experience this little war of mine"
Tf2,"primal carnage cs Tf2 realistic dinosaurs"
Portal,"warning this review contains spoilers of the game ok this mod is brilliant whoever thought of this is genius the game mechanics of Portal are changed but nonetheless still have the same feel to it and although confusing at first you get used to them the only things that really sucks about this game are three things 1 there s this part where you have to deactivate some machines and stuff you have to go on an insane track of jumping and speeding and everything except my instincts told me to go to this little square in the wall but when it said to skip the section ahead i didn t read it properly and jumped it to it and the worst part is that it doesnt even skip it it plays someone playing it which was really lame i was really disappointed and i didn t want to play through the whole chapter again for that one bit 2 like Portal almost no replay value 3 the ending of the game is just really bad this new personality core called nigel who is likeable and funny has been hinted as evil and wants to kill you towards the end of the game but the ending is just a copy and paste of the original Portal you re on a platform descending into fire and because your paint gun was deactivated there was no way to avoid it the game even points out the loophole of you not needing to die and the last thing you hear is just nigel describing the rising temperature and then the credits roll this left a really bad taste in my mouth and it just felt the same but worse because at least in Portal there s a lot more even after you think the inevitable that really sucked and i didn t like the ending really and there s not even really any end in sight of the game it just sort of ends but overall this game is worth the money it s got a community workshop which is pretty cool granting lots of possibilites if you re a fan of Portal 2 you ll like this game pros great mechanics great gameplay good voice actingcons ending isn t up to par with the rest of the game no replay value really no real easter eggs of sorts8 10"
The_Community,"this game is mildy enjoyable for the first few hours you play it during the first few hours you re matched with people in the low level group where things are fair and mostly even once you pass those few levels you ll hit the biggest pay wall i ve ever experience everyone you verse will have payed weapons you just can t compete with and amazing gear that makes your really bad weapons ever worse in the terms of match making the queue times are pretty short a minute or so to get in game you ll be lucky to get into the medium connection speeds if you re not in the us and the majority of The_Community doesn t speak english anyway which is terrible for such a tactical shooter try it if you want but you ll suffer under the might that is pay to win"

Portal,"firstly i d like to say that this game is very far up on my favourite games of all time alongside games of completely different genres such as fallout 2 the setting for Portal is unclear immediately but you quickly become aware of the fact that you are a test subject for aperture labs whcih cements its place in the half life universe guided by an omnipresent voice you make your way through the different chambers of increasingly difficult tests although this synopsis may make this game seem somewhat shallow it most certainly is not the main character chell although mute develops a personality regardless an attachment is created with this voice guiding you and most cryptically is the hidden areas in the chambers these give background into aperture laboratories the voice and possibly the sole survivor when compared to Portal 2 Portal does have some significant flaws this include a lack of characters and personality which although there isn t built upon until later in the game there aren t as many testing mechanics in the original but this leads to much more creative test designes requiring ingenuity over resources overall this game is amazing and you will fell dissapointed upon its completion Portal 2 builds upon the first and is a must after this is completed"

Half_Life_2,"half life 2 episode one is the first of the two episodes that take place after the end of Half_Life_2 after an ending oddly reminiscent of the first game we are once again left on a cliffhanger after the events of Half_Life_2 this game is the continuation of Half_Life_2 and once again we take control of gordon freeman on his unstoppable killing spree while episode one is very short in comparison to Half_Life_2 it still holds the same level of quality in terms of gameplay the same characters are there and a few new enemies and mechanics are introduced none of this is exactly game changing yet it does keep it fresh the story lacks a little which is mainly due to the lenght of the game there isn t much to say for episode one that hasn t already been said for Half_Life_2 while it is fun to fight alongside alyx it doesn t quite make up for the length of it if purchased through the orange box it isn t much of a problem overall definitely worth playing but only as part of the series and not on its own"

Half_Life_2,"the sequel to the critically acclaimed half life Half_Life_2 breathes new life into the series after the cliffhanger of the original half life gordon freeman is once again thrust into an alien invasion this time however the invaders have effectively taken control of every resource and major population center on earth the prowess of the invaders is staggering at least until freeman manages to obtain another crowbar after meeting with some old allies a terrible mistake exposes freeman to the dictatorship in control of earth which leads to the mobilisation of all available units with the sole purpose of destroying freeman without giving too much away mayhem awaits the plot of Half_Life_2 really is quite impressive especially when considering that half life had only a simple story Half_Life_2 branches off from the original in an impressive manner showing off the impressive writing talents of the valve team the plot is discovered through typical half life fashion your surroundings while it s no dark souls in terms of plot it doesn t obviously point out all the plot points nor does it pause your game to tell you insignificant amounts of information gameplay in Half_Life_2 is similar to the original except with a new arsenal and significantly larger environment while restrained to the black mesa facility in half life freeman is free to explore the world in the much largr sequel this leads to more epic fights environments and strategies the new space is well utilised in most cases helicopters must be shot down yet can do significant damage to any areas where you may hide the combine will attempt to ambush you whenever possible which leads to surprises the enemies and environment are impressive the environment depicts what happens to earth after being completely dominated by atechnologically superior force and the aliens fit into areas apropriate for them such asthe antlions whom live under sand in beaches overall i would say that Half_Life_2 builds on the original game in every way yet it does not replace it it creates an amazing world and great cast of characters that you will feel attached to even the silent protagonist gordon freeman and the seemingly omnipotent g man i highly recommend this game for its story gameplay characters and everything else that makes it amazing"

Terraria,"Terraria is the cool think to do"
Terraria,"okay so i ve already praised this game and all it s features but there s just been a massive update it has completely overhauled every detail of the game and it honestly does not have the same feel it is so much more awesome the matter manipulator is useful now combat is much more challenging and fun but most importantly it doesn t feel like Terraria 2 anymore this game was already unique enough as it was but now this could honestly be released as a full game right now and i wouldn t complain but these guys know why minecraft and Terraria did well i only have a few nitpicks like all ore is significantly rarer wtf are core fragments but i digress if you liked Terraria you are going to play this for ages it is accessible but can provide a pretty good challenge it s good buy it"
Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive is another installment in the game s series and is quite an amazing game really i only got to get this game through steam sales and the normal price tag of the game will explain the seemingly unreasonable prices for good weapon skins on steam market anyway about this counterstrike game it is a great fps for a comparably cheaper price than other well known ones and provides a good player base for people from australia to play i am only mentioning aust but its a wide spread game and playing with friends is actually fun the ranking system i guess is adequate but sometimes a little off the mark sometimes the system pairs you up with really high ranked people leaving you behind in the scoreboard i understand that when moving up from silver to nova makes u verse novas but sometimes its a little unfair all in all cs go is a great game not just to play by yourself get your friends on this d it s an amazing game by valve"

Team_Fortress_2,"i ve never been particularly fond of multiplayer shooters from my limited experience they have this intial rush that feels pretty good but that feeling slowly fades to leave behind a bleak and dry experience they just seem to lack the engaging elements that singleplayer games have and use so well that s not the case with Team_Fortress_2 though this game is fun not only is the gameplay deep intuitive and interesting but it also accentuates the style and the style accentuates it the characters are surprisingly fleshed out and i would recommend reading some of the comics overall give it a go"

Dota_2,"much better then league of legends this is coming from someone who played RIRE since beta up until 6 months ago Dota_2 shines above other games in the genre for these reasons 1 hero versatility2 learning curve is steeper but more rewarding3 games snowball less but if they do its for the right reasons 4 games are less likely to be decided early therefore there is always plenty of time for a comeback overall the game is much more rewarding for someone who is starting out in this genre highly recommended"

The_Community,"this game is amazing it is so much fun know that u can get items faster but the only problem i have with this game is that when your in a battle adn your game freezes and no ones moving to only thing u can do is exit out of the game but then when you go back into the a multiplayer game it says you have to wait 2 minutes when it wasnt your fault the internet crashed and veryone throse so know you are waisting your day trying to get into a server but ather then that problem the game is super amazing with all the cool robots people make The_Community is great what i dont get is that you have to be 13 to play the game when you cant swear so the game has miner issues other than that the game is great i would rate this game 6 10 jsut becuase of all the problems with the servers and the age i know iam being harsh on a game that is early access but still hopefully they fix dat problem drgames youtube"

Csgo,"i really enjoy playing Csgo going from serious competitive matches to casually playing a match with a variety of game modes it is really addicting and great to have fun on with a couple friends it is simple to play but hard to master anything can happen in this game and that s what is so amazing about it it would take a lot of hours to master the skills of dominating your opponents another great positive is there are always servers to play on"

The_Community,"this game was everything that sim city should have been and more sure there is some more finese required but the developers have been smart to open the game right up to The_Community for modding and editing and this has made this game a step ahead of any other city builder the only bad thing is the amount of sleep and productivity you ll lose as you spend hour upon hour making the finest city possible"

Evolve,"a little story to describe my game experience in ark survival Evolved i had supported this game since the beginning so don t get the idea i was a newbro had rolled up over 700 hours in a few months alone i was recently globally banned yes globally as in all servers not just the one i was on for refusing to change my tribe name from the band name cky when i questioned the admin who threatened me with expulsion why i had to change it he globally banned me when i contacted studio wildcard directly to repeal the ban and even went as far to send video and screen captured evidence of the conversations i was completely ignored i now have a basically useless game on my steam list all due to an over zealous ban happy admin with an itchy button finger also the admin banned my partner s account for no reason whatsoever just in case i was playing on her account too it s not often you get server admins and developers who are less mature than their player base thanks wildcard oh also the frame rate sucks even on modern super computers and the gameplay is kind of stale in the current market 1 10 simply because i was able to drown most of my own dinos before he banned me would ride a trex into the ocean depths again"
Tf2,"update it s dead thanks devs oh and sony too pi paid for the most expensive starter pack i m regretting that now old review a mixture of the old style movement system that seems to be quite the rarity with games like cod and the like that have a cover system taking up the charts it s 3rd person perspective hit the sweet spot for me as the extra field of view lets you notice those sneaky remote control rockets before they kick you in the butt and it definitly suits the movement system that expects you to know about your surroundings that could change in an instant from your opponent s ever changing weapons example noob hey that timed insta kill sticky wasn t there befo boom on the topic of changeable weapons it certainly allows a lot of freedom that unfortunatly people dont understand as you can break the conventional weapon type speedy bouncing lazer pointed tunneling rockets anyone that most other games seem to stick to like it s the law balancing may be an issue right now but the devs sure are active with their constant streams about upcoming features and community requests about new features and statistic adjustments like the currently op shield getting a mix up possibly making it even more op depending on how well you use it and although the game s personality may be a bit like xbox live s the community in general seems to be pretty good although i will admit that quite a few people don t yet understand what the f7 button does as they complain about glitches hacks hackusations if you didn t know what it does it creates a report for the devs to look at with extra information supplied by you and it s the same button as plenty of other games like Tf2 hooked on it right now"

Half_Life_2,"this game is a hidden gem among the deep heart of steam s heart Half_Life_2 deathmatch throws all the hl2 weapons and throws you in an amazing selection of maps to fight in this game is the lovely old deathmatch styled games you either kill or be killed no hiding like games nowdays you are the man the badass the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit skill is everything not some weapon you need to buy for 5 dollars Half_Life_2 deathmatch takes the badassness to the next level you get to throw toilet bowls at each other with the gravity gun and get to time frags like a boss sadly the fans of deathmatches aren t as popular as the past so recommend this piece of badassery to your friends 10 10 can shoot toilet bowls"
Tf2,"team fortress classic is what you want in Tf2 but did not happen has frags relies heavily on teamwork requires skills can mlg360noscope can bunnyhop medic s are amazing at being flag carriers doesn t need to be f2p to be awesome doesn t have cod kids snipers looks legit enough scout looks like a man has a nailgun best game weapon balancing ever seennuff said if it s 2 bucks add to cart and pop frags"
Nether,"i recommend dayz cause of the open world zombie simulation type game i love the mechanic and the way you shoot its a real good vibe and its kinda like real life in shelfs are normal junk and helmets and all that and really rare guns like an m4 under a military bed that seems realistic but i would think theyd be in a gun rack and it is also good because i played Nether and when you die your stuff drops but in dayz the loot stays on body unless they log and i just feel like its a real good game hope alot of people buy this and hope to see you online if you dont kill me"
Half_Life_2,"new reviewokay i hated on this game before i had fully experienced it this game is very flawed nevertheless it is still a good game many of the areas are confusingly laid out and some of the puzzle solutions are stupid still the general gameplay is decent and for fans of Half_Life_2 this is a must get"

Evolve,"my very good totally not sarcastic review of ark survival Evolved the game is great first off the game runs amazingly it s clearly very well optimised that is sarcasm for those of you too stupid to figure it out for yourself the pacing is perfect it s not a true survival game unless it takes a year to do anything the dinosaurs look great everyone knows dinosaurs are part rock monster it s very uniche and not just a survival game with dinosaurs thrown in to cash in on jurassic world i also love how when you review other dinosaur games negetivly people say try ark it s very useful cause i had never tried it before someone told me to not at all overall i give the game a 9 11 it s perfect no flaws at all and if you think otherwise then screw you"
Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive is a great game it has a good gaming community and a great competitive side with it being constantly updated with new material like new operations with missions new player created gun skins and new maps you can never get bored this game keeps the classic feel of the previous cs games and adds more to it reimagined but classic maps that youll remember and still love and guns that have different plaiying styles that need mastering individually this game is a must for any steam gamer yeww"

Tf2,"this game is as sonic s announcer would say good great outstanding amazing now onto why this game is exactly like most other games such as Tf2 and other similar games you probably get the jist the main idea of this game is that you can build anything i have seen people roll around in pixelart doges or pepes sure everything is stuck behind leveling up but after you play for a bit the level ups start rolling in and suddenly you can fly shoot missiles or warp ahead i can t recommend this game enough"
The_Community,"okay even though i have put it off for a while robocraft has gotten me hooked again yes again but now that some major updates have came out i m getting back into it the visuals are really good now and many old bugs such as clipping through respawn area s are gone then again more bugs will be found and fixed mostly by The_Community so yeah i d recomend robocraft to anyone 10 10"
The_Community,"this game is one of the best survival games ever from the gameplay to The_Community this indie title reaks of nostalgia gameplay wise it s simple but you can so deep into this game that you can t get out of the cycle of finding a timberwolf or a maplestrike in my opinion this game is two things dayz and minecraft 94 timberwolf is the rarest sniper rife in the game maplestrike is a military grade assault rifle"

The_Community,"now that minimum is back up i ve decided to change my review minimum is a pretty awesome game with fun gameplay and a creative array of weaponry pro s nice map and entity design creative weapons and armour yes i know i m repeating myself option to play as a male or female which i know some people find important titan mode is fun to play and the titans are pretty awe inspiring when they clash only real learning curve is learning how to counter melee don t listen to those who complain melee is too overpowered it is very easy to counter with the right weaponry and with enough practice con s the inventory whipe kind of killed it for me i had spent a long time obtaining my items and while they said that they made all cosmetics items craftable some of my favourites are actually not craftable such as the harvest sickles and the pumpkin grenades australian s may have a hard time playing as the player hosted servers can get quite lag but its usually not unbearable last i checked the co op survival mode i believe it was called horde mode or something was currently not working which sucks because it used to be very fun while the cons i ve listed may seem to outweigh the pro s this is really not the case minimum is a very fun game and i can t wait till it s completely restored to its former glory minimum was one of my favourite games however i would not recommend buying it not that you can in it s current state due to 1 this is the most important issue the servers have been down for what seems like an eternity you can not actually play the game should you buy it b 2 prior to the server issues the new developers did not release that much new content they redid some maps and released a couple new maps but didn t add any new weapons or armour not that the old developer were any better as prior to the new developers taking ownership of the game they had not released anything new for quite some time the last content update i remember was an april fools joke when they added an invisible weapon and armour the promo for said armour looked awesome shame they didn t just make that armour 3 prior to the server issues The_Community was very small quite often you d end up being put on a server with bots rather than one of the few servers with people on them this was not always the case as The_Community used to be huge before the old devs stopped making new content minimum was an amazing game and should they fix all the problems and actually bring the servers back online and start releasing new content it would be a lot easier if they just hosted directly through steam like some other games then go ahead and buy it you won t regret it but sadly it doesn t look like that time is coming any time soon thankyou for reading my review"
Tf2,"warhammer 40k eternal crusade looks very promising but it is important to note that in its current state it is more of a combat demo the final game will be a open world mmo shooter while in its current state its a pvp session shooter session shooters are games like Tf2 and rainbow 6 siege"
Airmech,"this is the first soundtrack i ve actually purchased not including things like the grey goo soundtrack which came with an expansion so while i may not be able to compare it to other soundtracks i still felt that i should give it a good review proscomes with some nice ingame content the warthog skin is one of my new favourite skins great music it s not too pricey if you really want to you can sell the ingame content you get for quite a nice amount of diamonds consif you re not big on music the only thing you really get out of this is the ingame content it does not explain how to access your new songs i was expecting them to be added to the music section of my steam library when it turns out i had to actually go into Airmechs files to find them if you re not a fan of electronic music than again all you ll really get out of buying this is the ingame content"
The_Community,"the game went to heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit as soon as nwi released the update where they changed the respawn locations of most maps and The_Community has become slightly more cancerous ever since day of infamy if they fix the respawn positions back to how they were then this game will be worth buying but for now it s only worth buying when it s on sale apart from that this game is fantastic"

Dota_2,"okay i l just get this right out there Dota_2 has one of the worst communities in all of gaming the game itself is intricet and almost impossible to master a 10 10 in gaming but 2 10 for everyone else you have to play with online if you go this game alone it will be difficult but if you have friends who are willing to play it then by all means let the gaping black hole that is Dota_2 take you into an adventure that you will regret entering but love playing ai in this game is very good for the scaling player having easy medium hard and unfair as your difficulties once you can beat unfair bots you are ready to play online at least that s what i suggest"

Dota_2,"Dota_2 what is there you didn t want in a game this game yes can be frustrating and unforgiving and yes can be hard to get used to but that is the fun in which this game provides you with you may struggle to survive in the jungle against a five man gank and continuously get slaughtered but as a team and with strategies you and your team can survive to become the victors at the end of the game when i first started playing this game i had a hard time getting used to moba s and never had seen them before which in turn made it so much more difficult for me to understand what was going on but with the support of my mates i learnt and gradually got better i would strongly reccommed new players to play a few hours of bot games first because going online with no experience like i did doesn t benifit your team yes you may win but was it worth all the jeering and crude comments from both your own team for feeding and the opposition for being quite horrible at the game but most importantly you must have fun playing a game without having fun makes there no reason to play it"

Tf2,"i was very close to not recomending this game because as fun as it is as much as i love it almost nobody is playing it and for a mostly multiplayer game thats certainly not a good thing you also need better internet then what ever Tf2 needs as lag spikes are more often for me then that game the main reason i recomend it is because i want more people to play it"
Portal,"if you have Portal 2 there is absolutely no reason not to get twtm the new time travel mechanic works very well and adds a brand new feel to the game which is a very good one puzzling puzzles and timey time it s like getting paid dlc for free 10 10 would teabag self again"

Tf2,"ever since the meat your match update i haven t been able to play Tf2 i press the play game button at the top of the screen but nothing happens this may be a result of me already having a custom hub before the update came out but it s only a hunch and i am still unaware of why i m restricted from playing"

Half_Life_2,"one of the most extraordinary games i have ever played with a great storyline and intense action every step of the way yes Half_Life_2 is still better the qte in this game are some of the best that i have seen making the player feel like they are really a part of the action characters such as lara croft and her breasts seem very lifelike and it really makes the player connect with lara as she is propelled in numerous dangerous situations the game overall is a bit short but it easy to get lost in the scenary and the number of side quests and tombs that the game throws at you it is not a cover shooter 9 5 10"

The_Community,"this is a great game for younger gamers its basically a minecraft dayz mixed game but more of dayz but less bugs than dayz its quite hard to believe that a 16 year old named nelson sexton made this game all by himself and so far i ve got over 100 hrs in game and i m loving it its got simple graphics but it makes up for it because it gives you a chance to feel a i ve got to survive this feeling and thats what i love about these games although there aren t many aussie servers that are 24 7 online its still got great potenicial and i think nelson could potencially make the game even greater than what it already is and if he chooses to let The_Community do the features when 3 0 comes out with the workshop modding api maybe it d get more purchases for gold but i think if you buy gold its not just about the features but actually that your supporting the development and pushing the game along so it can be what The_Community wants the survival featuresyou can basically run around a town and find a melee weapon anywhere but when you find a gun you know you ve got to save the ammo and don t be a complete idiot and shoot in a town full of zombies and make them chase after you and when you run out of ammo you ve got to quickly equip a melee weapon and thats fun as i ve died like over a million times by doing that and the experience skills are great but i guess their could be more unqiue skills but when i got all the skills i was partying with chemlights until a zombie came and killed me because i put my weapons in my chest and that was the end of my skills well not exactly the end of them they give you back half of your skills but when you ve got like 3 levels of one skill once you die you ll get 1 level in that skill back over all the survival features are awesome the crafting featuresthe crafting is a little hard to get used to so you may have to google the recipes up like i did a thousand times and the great thing about it is that you can refill your bullets so if you found a gun in a town then it d be a civillian gun so you can use civillian bullets to refill it but i was confused when i had a swift mag because when i click on it the desc says its a military grade mag but i can t use military bullets to refill it thats because you need civil bullets because its found in civillian areas aswell as military but when you create a house you can bascially start putting some skills in crafting and outdoors if you have crafting level one you can craft a crate that doesn t lock so anyone can open it and steal stuff but also with level 1 crafting you can make some stone crafting recipes when you have level 2 crafting aka max crafting you can craft either a chest which is locked and has 6 slots and the metal locker that has the same 4 slots but i guess is harder to break with a sledge hammer and other melee weapons also with crafting level 2 you can make metal building materials which the person who placed it is the only one who can open or close it you can also craft other stuff out of cloth and gear like attachments and etc but overall it would be really good if the person who placed the building material could actually pick it up if they placed it in the wrong spot or just simply want to move i love this game and i would seriously recommend buying a permenant gold upgrade although i haven t done it yet i m going to so i can support nelson and i rate it 12 10 d best of luck to nelson sexton to making 3 0 possible"
Terraria,"Terraria is a splendid mix of fantasy sand box adventure and a whole lot more you ' re guaranteed to find yourself immersed in this creative rpg with everything from wood cutting to build your first shack to complex electronics and then to fighting off an old man possessed with a giant skeleton demon i ' m an maliciously hard of a judge to please but even i have to give this a 10 10"

Tf2,"what can i say payday was a solid staple game for my friends for about 5 6 years we all preordered the criminal career edition and had a blast i even stuck through it when a bug deleted my entire save af about 3 6 months work now heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit it it even isn t worth it on a free weekend reddit had made jokes ironically about us becoming the next Tf2 or the next cs go and now that it s here i think it was the final straw this has made me incredibly sad to see one of the game studio s i admire to sink so low for those out of the loop anfd want a basic overview of why there is so much outrage overkill have heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ed the weapons up to make shotguns more than twice as weak as pistols and added skins you get from safes which you open with drills for 2 49 that give stat boosts edit figured i d edit this review now especially given whats happened now drills and safes are free now that everything is attainable without spending money outside of dlc i feel like i can recommend this game again"

Terraria,"omg this is the best game ever created its like Terraria with medieval and capture the flag in it and it has chickens buy it now"
Portal,"overall i quite liked most of it and recommend it it s free anyway the time travel mechanic is very nicely executed and a lot of fun to figure out from the start of the game i found myself having a lot of fun with it having it there adds a new very interesting mechanic that really puzzles the brain like very few Portal mods can really achieve however this game suffers from a lot of very common problems that plague Portal 2 mods and maps the maps are needlessly huuge in a lot of areas you just walk and walk merely to push a button and then you have to backtrack it does get a little pedantic especially once you ve figured out what you re supposed to do a lot of it is to make way for the custom story this is made worse by the fact there is hardly any surfaces you can actually place a Portal on in fact some whole levels see you never even using the Portal gun so a lot of walking the game seemed to quickly drop logical challenges and veer towards timing acrobatic puzzles which i personally hate this seems to apply to the jump on your clone and get launched in the air mechanic where sometimes you get stuck in her head but none of these happen in the early levels so you can simply download it fire it up and play it as long as you enjoy it and of course some people likely enjoy some of the above mechanics or don t mind them"

Tf2,"great addictive game when i went to the ign Tf2 was pwning the awards if you havn t got it then you should get it"
Nether,"this is a very good game but i have two very major gripes with it first is that there are no australian servers this can be slightly excusable but i like to know that my country exists to other people one or two servers based in somewhere like adelaid or sydney would be great this is frustrating because that means that your austrailian market is required to join the asian servers that have over 150ms of ping that s 1 second too many you have already died by the time you ve realised you ve been shot australians are really at a disadvantage because of this second are the random and rather critical flaws and bugs i know that this will eventually be fixed with development but that does not fix their current presence in the game they can range from small things like your character stuck moving forward for a time which can be fatal in a fight or range from big things like your character randomly suffering from a terminal cardiac arrest and promptly dying losing all of your gear and progress as i ve said this problem will eventually be fixed with development but they still exist today despite all this i highly reccommend this game because of the amount of times i have become stressed angry annoyed and felt truly alone while playing it these are all very good things because that is what the game is focused on survival by any means in a cruel hard and desolate environment i can t count the amount of times i ve raged at another player because he took my stuff after giving my brain a new ventilation hole or have felt the heart thudding adreniline of escaping from mortal peril or coming down from a euforic high after destroying several different types of Nether then being shot by another player it s good fun if you are looking for an rpg ish guns guts and glory post apocolyptic survival game where anything goes one thing i ve noticed is that no matter your level or how good you think you are in this game someone can still best you if they have just started out if they are smart it s an even playing field with some barricades optional be warned and have fun"
The_Community,"very amazing and cool game i must say i really like the graphics overall and how the game is improving all the time and how the developers are improving it and that they listen to The_Community and the youtubers great game overall i suggest you to buy if you like exploration games like subnautica"
Tf2,"if the 2k games is gon na launch this with paid access for 59 99 i would rather think they would set up some multiplayers for this game i mean everyone can be a pro at playing this even after playing it or even somebody called me to do something outside well i d rather playing it 2x a day finishing it wasting my damn 6 hours of playing it i don t really want to make a refund to steam 2k games community because i would rather die if i don t have this or got it refund from the first place you see i would really waste my damn time instead of doing something important after that hours of finishing it i was testing if i could play it from a philippine made gamepad but doesn t really work this year and actually if i didn t really bought this game at the first place and sold it to Tf2outpost what a waste of time and got my future me lazy not but at least i hope they will make a multiplayer settings very soon and new dlc which i would like to call after releasing new episode the burial at sea episode 2 i was expecting about it that it could get cool after i ve played it anyways thats bout it may they release the new multiplayer for playing for the bright future 10 10 bring back the 3rd bioshock series as a g o t y game of the year of 2014 never ending of playing it but happy to play it updated since 1 15 2014 january 15 2014"

The_Culling,"The_Culling a last man standing multiplayer deathmatch game with survival elements basic crafting looting basic resource gathering it s a battle royale esque game though more like the condemned imo that takes place inside a dome with 16 contestants and up to 25 minute rounds the game itself has a good concept but overall it feels quite cheap the melee combat system uses a rock paper scissors mechanism consisting of attack block shove the balancing with the system is fine imo no complaints here shoving briefly staggers the opponent or defeats their block for those wondering the system is quite clunky in its current state though seeing as melee combat is essentially the main aspect of the game it is quite disappointing the feedback when you land a blow or get struck isn t great either rust has better melee feedback that isn t saying much add bad netcode and high latency servers on top of that and it just feels very sloppy aws cloud servers btw horrible for real time twitch games i hope they eventually move to proper dedicated servers i understand it s in early access but compared to the other early access games i ve played this is lacking i really wanted to like this game but the basic elements that make up the core gameplay have been i wouldn t say poorly but rather crudely executed honestly i would probably come back to this game sometime in the future once more time has been spent developing the core mechanics i see a promising future ahead for this game as long as they iron out the kinks and continue working on and improving the current foundations of the game but i don t see that happening for at least another 6 months so that s why i can not recommend the game at this point in time"

Super_Meat_Boy,"fast and stylish hotline miami is only let down by its obfuscated story leaving puzzling and unservicable hints to a greater narrative much like the graphics and setting the gameplay of hotline miami is a thowback to nes difficulty not unlike Super_Meat_Boy a few years ago the game embraces its difficulty by slingshotting you back into the next attempt quickly with generous checkpointing and bite size levels this means to rapidly reattempt levels the scoring system and the rewards of new weaponry and mask makes hotline miami addictive and satisfying to complete highly recommended"
Evolve,"strong contender for game of the year 2012 dishonored utilizes a fantastic universe and exceptional gameplay to tell the revenge tale of corvo attano the game is exceptionally opened giving the player true customization over how they wish to achieve their task which typically rEvolve around disposing fatally or not of key targets the really appealing aspect of the game is each area is fairly open giving the player the choice on how they wish to achieve their task which can range from stealhy sewer trecking utilizing magic to not be seen and non lethally deal with targets or a more confronting method in which you unleash swarms of rats and shoot foes in the face the setting of the game is also extremely cool the city of dunwall is full of steampunk achievements plague carrying rats and victims known as weepers and a secretive occult to the enimatic outsider buy this game"

The_Community,"even though it s an old teamwork oriented game it still is so much fun to play on and has so many things to do never gets boring if you have 2 3 friends to play together in versus games also the custom campaigns from the workshop add a boost of entertaining and the scavenge on the rooftop from no mercy map is very awesome the plot is simple because all you need to do is to go from a safe house to another killing everything which is in your way i spent on over 2k hours on and the price is worth it that s why i highly suggest everyone who s interested in good content should try this it has its ups and downs you can basically meet all sorts of people in The_Community nicer or less nicer from where you can choose to play further this is why it s very competitive from time to time you can experience minor bugs but they don t downgrade the experience in conclusion i give this game 10 10 one of the best old games out there"
Csgo,"it done brokeded on me the game no longer works for some reason i clikc play to open the game and it runs the Csgo exe thing and it shows up on my task bar mac but then it says instantly that the program isn t responding and just sits there and doesn t do anything i tried validating the game files and it came back with a missing not found corrupt not sure which one didn t specify and then it said that it would go fetch it again so i ran the game and then closed it after it didn t work again and then validated the files once more and it came back as all files being accounted for so i m pretty bumbed out coz i love playing Csgo and wanted to chill this arvo but no thanks steam i really appreciate it man 3"

Tf2,"chivalry is the kind of game that is fairly easy to jump into but has a lot more to it than you d think first i ll just describe it for you and then i ll share my thoughts on the game it s essentially a online multiplayer only fps with swords instead of guns it s a class based game with 4 classes to choose from there are various gamemodes which you ll recognise if you ve ever played games like Tf2 or cod before there s team objective mode free for all team deathmatch and last team standing modes among others team objective mode plays similarly to the payload or capture the point modes in Tf2 in the sense that you run forward from your spawn complete objective a then your spawn moves forward then you do objective b etc servers generally have a player limit of 32 players 16 to each team and the playerbase is quite large so you ll never have problems finding a server to join there are plenty of low level servers as well if you want a more noob friendly place to play the actual mechanics are very straightforward fights consist of hacking and slashing at your enemy parrying blocking his attacks and trying not to die first or you can be an archer and pick them off from a distance you can discover all the basic combat mechanics within a couple hours of playing because of how simple it is let me just say this right now you will die a lot at first and you will probably want to give up there are players who have played for thousands of hours who will kill you over and over leaving you frusrated and ready to ragequit chivalry is the kind of game you can sink hours and hours into but never really master the mechanics are simple yes but it takes a lot of time to understand how to play well there are only a few different types of attacks and the weapons all have the same basic mechanics to them but it takes a lot of time to get a feel for when to start an attack when to hold back when to parry etc if you push through it the game becomes very enjoyable i hope that gives you a basic idea of what the game is about now i ll put some of my own thoughts out as of writing this i have played over 100 hours over a span about a year and a half and i don t regret it at all it s one of the only games i don t think i will ever truly stop playing the community is great the combat never really gets old and even after all this time i can t say i ve gotten sick of it i can t say the game is 100 perfect though the fact that the mechanics are so basic means that fighting higher level players often boils down to who knows the most exploits any swing of a weapon can be parried to do no damage at all and once you know how to parry the only way you can be hit is by luck or you somehow screw it up or the other persons feints to trick you into parrying early but you can even learn to spot when someone is going to feint so fighting can just end up swing parry swing parry swing parry etc until one person slips up this kind of combat doesn t rely on skill it relies on one person misclicking and screwing up but that being said even after 100 hours of play time i can t say i ve really mastered the game there are heaps of little tricks that people use to break away from the boring swing parry swing parry combat which i ll probably never get the hang of and it keeps me on edge whenever i m playing so would i reccommend this game definitely for all the hours i ve spent and enjoyed it was definitely worth the 5 i paid for it when it was on sale one weekend i d probably have paid 50 or so if i d known how good it was look up some videos on the internet of the kind of hijinks you get can up to and you ll see what i mean by how much fun you can have in this game"

The_Community,"this game is one of the best games ive played it is fun and the mechanics i absolutely love but until the bugs are fixed and the game is actually playable this game deserves no new players absolutely outrageuos that i cant play a single player match without the game crashing either instantly or a few turns in and in multiplayer i can never host or the same thing happens many people have this problem and have had it for years this game is complete trash and not worth a single cent until the developers get off their asses and give a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit about The_Community enough to fix game breaking problems before shipping out a new broken game in the series"

The_Community,"new update so after four months the game finally got an update all it took was the game being pulled from sale on steam seems very suspicious as The_Community was in uproar for months with no word from the dev jig then within two weeks of the game getting pulled from sale we suddenly get an update as for the content one new dinosaur which was already in the game files and unlocked by modders months ago stampedes which consist of 30 dinosaurs running around eachother in circles instead of the normal one or two a trap mechanic which is poorly implemented and a couple of value changes i doubt the dev spent more than a couple hours on it id hold out on any purchase of this game untill we get a steady steam of updates and a promise from the dev that they arnt going to just dissapear as soon as the money starts coming back in the game has potential but i honestly don t know if the dev has the ability to finish it update it s now been over two months there have been 0 updates in that time no ones heard anything from the devs and it turns out that the pr manager governor ostrich was a freelancer who s contract expired may 31st no updates no word from devs stay clear"
The_Community,"huge open world loads of stuff to build considering its only been out a few days decent graphics much less lag than before they patched it ignore the negative reviews by people that don t understand what an early access is these are honestly some of the nicest devs i ve seen and they will work their asses off to make sure this game gets better and better have a look in The_Community forum and ask em a question if you want the fact that they ll answer it is an absolute breath of fresh air compared to some devs and your response will come way quicker than you d expect"
Well_There,"summary - pros tfun gameplay and tight controls tgreat atmosphere music visuals and story tdoesn ' t outstay its welcome cons tsome dodgy sound effects tfrustrating at times tbalance issues score - 7 10short fun and cheap worth picking up dextended review halo spartan assault is a fun and short game it took me just over 3 hours to complete the campaign and most of the time i was enjoying myself the controls are great for a pc port the graphics are good considering this is a pc port there are all the basic video settings but i often encountered a bug where upon tabbing out the game would exit full screen and enter a small window and i was unable to revert back to full screen without relaunching the game a small hindrance due to the short levels but it does get annoying on to the actual gameplay and atmosphere now the gameplay is fun and rather simple top down shooter with a few objectives to complete over a 3 8 minute long level there are a variety of objectives that never overstay their welcome or re occur too often there also additional challenges in the form of both assault ops and weekly challenges spartan assault rewards kills with a simple points system points are rewarded per kill and vary in quantity for what you kill medals can also be earned through killing enemies in a certain way the same as medals in other halo games depending on the amount of points earned during a mission xp is rewarded after the game to purchase additional weapons armour abilities and boosters for damage shield regen and points for a single mission skulls difficulty modifiers can be applied to earn more xp there is a great selection of enemies vehicles weaponry and gadgets at your disposal enemies react well and behave as you would expect from a halo game there are a large selection of enemies that you encounter ranging from meek grunts to tough and aggressive brute chieftains vehicles look very good in spartan assault but some tanks and wraiths suffer from some clunky controls all weapons feel effective but could use a little spruce up in the sound department and some balancing most gadgets are useful one way or another but there are a few that don t seem to have much use at all the energy shield is very hard to position and provides minimal cover along with slogging you down on the other hand the stun aoe is brilliantly effective if not a little op overall combat feels good but could use some balancing and punchier sound design the graphics and textures are impressive for a port they look detailed smooth and move very fluidly some environments feel a little bland but this can be ignored by the vast majority of exciting and wild landscapes that capture both the beauty and war torn horror of the halo universe the cut scenes are brilliant the moving comic art style that halo fans may be familiar with has returned and has never looked better it is simply put the animation of an art piece the story that accompanies these cut scenes is easy to follow but interesting nonetheless the main story is told through cut scenes but additional story can be found in the mission briefing the music of spartan assault is also amazing it perfectly captures the spirit of previous halo titles and mixes in some new sounds as Well_There is a piece of music for every mood in spartan ops and every piece is amazing the overall atmosphere is dark but enthralling and debatably the best part of spartan assault there are 6 campaign chapters with 5 levels per chapter amounting to 30 short levels playing through these levels i rarely died but the points that i did die at i died repeatedly this caused quite a bit of frustration for me but after investing my xp into additional weapons and ' power ups ' i managed to surpass them by the end of my time with spartan assault i felt that dropping 5 on a short enjoyable title like this was well worth my money overall i feel that the game is absolutely worth picking up if you ' re a fan of the halo universe or just looking for a short but enjoyable game 7 10"
Team_Fortress_2,"absolutely awesome game a great range of classes to choose from scout is a fast running class that is mostely used for doing the map objective capture the flag pushing cart and just generally annoying people soldier is a slow moving class armed with a rocket launcer a shotgun and a entrenching tool shovel soldier is one of the main damage dealers in Team_Fortress_2 the pyro is a masked psycho armed with a flame thrower a shotgun and a fire axe pyro is again a main damage dealer but instead he she uses his hers flame thrower to burn enemies alive the demolitions man demo man is much like the soldier with explosive weapons instead a grenade launcher a sticky bomb launcher manually exploded bombs that stick to walls etc and a bottle the demoman is a main damage dealer aswell but used as a defence class because of his sticky bomb launcher to make traps he is also very drunk RIRE the heavy weapons guy is as you guess a guy with big heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit weapons he carries a minigun a shotgun and uses his fists to punch people heavy is the god of damage dealing he can kill all the other classes quite easily but be careful heavy is a very slow class and is quite vulnerable to take damage from behind the engineer the engineer is a defence class that creates sentry guns to defend he can upgrade his sentry 3 times level 1 being a normal sentry level 2 being two chainguns on the side and level 3 with a rocket launcher on the top the medic is the support class healing his teammates who are in need of help the medic is the second fastest class in Team_Fortress_2 he also has a thing called uber charge which is you and the person you re healing have a few seconds of invulnerability the sniper is a long ranged damage dealer he uses a powerful sniper rifle a smg and a machete the sniper can take out most classes in a quickshot however you can keep scoped in to fill a meter which makes your shots more powerful when this meter is full you can take out a heavy in one shot in the head the spy is a very different class the silent assassin the spy carries a revolver a knife and a electro sapper the electro sapper is used for destroying enemy engineer s sentry guns although the engineer can destroy these sappers that doesn t mean that you can t backstab him an important role in the spy is to backstab people with your knife to instantly kill your target the spy has the ability to make himself temporarily invisible and has the ability to disguise as the enemy team to fool them that is all the classes in team fotress 2 i hope this review was helpful and i hope to see you on a server good bye jarhead"

Zombie_Army_Trilogy,"Zombie_Army_Trilogy is a major upgrade when dealing with the zombie onslaughts with a matrix styled slow motion you can really get a deep satisfaction from a headshot granted the visuals are outstanding and i can not wait until my friends join me seeing that while enjoying a game solo is made so much better when it is a shared experience the game gives you a wide variety of weapons to use against the zombies and of course like in shaun of the dead you can melee by kicking the snot of them it would be great if the score was displayed so that bragging rights to the most kills would be easily shown but in my experience playing the campaign so far upon death is when you see how many you kill you may be surprised at how bloodthirsty you get whilst playing this game what are waiting for get this game and hunt some zombies"

The_Community,"great game hands down one of the best indie releases of the year insurgency is a fast paced realistic shooter an odd blend that the devs have made work oh so well the maps are well designed a small array weapons and attachments but all are functional and server puprose a unique weight system so those with heavy armour a m249 and chest carrier will run much slower then someone with a mp5k and a chest carrier this system allows for a varity of play styles would you rather be able to take an extra bullet while suppressing the enemy or have a small arms weapon flank around and kill everyone the game also immensely rewards objective based players by creating situations where you are the last surviving player on your team and the only way to respawn your team is to cap the objective it s moments like that which create the intensity of this game graphical insurgency isn t as flashy as say crysis or battlefield but it runs smooth on an i5 750 lynfield stock and a gtx 650 2gb gddr5 i m able to run the game almost maxed at a solid 60 frames per second the game is even playble on a mac according to my sources with all this said though the best thing about the game is The_Community if you go through the workshop of insurgency you will find a ton of custom gun models reskins sounds and so much more but it s not just the workshop content creators that make the game it s also the players yes the workshop content creators are players to i ve never had a bad time with a player on insurgency most people with mics use it for tactical advantage rather then playing some really annoying music and The_Community is generally pretty forgiving to unless you go on a murderous rampage on your own team all in all insurgency is a great game for a great price whether you pay the full 15 or pick it on sale it s well worth it"

Team_Fortress_2,"Team_Fortress_2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date there is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one the first time you start the simulator you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items if you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame you get your very first hat the gibus this is where it really starts to play the simulator correctly you have to spend money in the market place made by valve after that while you play the minigame you can find hats which you can trade for or collect there is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats just like you after you collect enough items and or hats try joining a trade server there the real fun begins good luck and beware of ending up poor"

The_Community,"this is a very fun 3rd person shooter with fun parkour mechanics the only problem with this game that can be a bit annoying and can wreck the game is The_Community there just aren t enough people on the servers to play with at least where i live and the bots while good stay in the exact same areas and only interact with you when you find them making the game feel empty sometimes"
Tf2,"hands down most addictive game online i have lost countless days and nights to this game beware you can never truly quit Tf2 everyone has tried but none have succeeded pretty good though 1 recommendation never get into trading it will ruin your life its too late for me but heed my warning trading is a deep deep hole which you can not escape from"

Csgo,"honestly this is like an even heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ier version of clash of clans i can kinda get why a city simulator with wait times would be popular on a mobile device but why on pc this isnt like a portable iphone its a pc so therefor this genre doesnt work on this platform and if u havnt guessed already this is pay to win as heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit i can understand paid items in Csgo or league but in a game like this it isnt just cosmetic change that doesnt impact skill its straight up cheating who wants to wait 5 hours for u to build up a new building in a city all to have it destroyed or downgraded by a kid using his mums credit card like a sword additionally half of the accounts on this game are inactive so trying to build up a group or a clan is difficult because most of the people you invite wont respond all in all dont buy this game its a waste of time"

The_Community,"dayz standalone after roughly playing this game for 20 hours i have enjoyed it so far although my review is going to be washed down by all the negetives i just want get my review out there dayz standalone has been in early access for about 3 years and some people just dont read the note displayed on the dayz standalone steam page warning this game is early access alpha please do not purchase it unless you want to actively support development of the game and are prepared to handle with serious issues and possible interruptions of game as a short answer i would say dont buy the game until its fully out or in beta unless you want to face countless glitches such as zombies running trough walls and triple hitting in dayz zombies are the least of your worries you can play as a legendery hero or a bandit i have been held as hostage 3 times already you can also play a role playing version of dayz i haven t touched dayzrp but you can play it here http ww dayzrp com pro srealistic unlike some other zombie survival games really big map that takes alot of your time and does not keep you board balanced weapons thats really it i cant remember anything else 3 con s really hard to meet new people as they might kill you or hold you hostage really hard to find ammunition because all millitary bases police stations are lootedeverywhere is looted if you play on a server with heaps of people conclusion anyone who says dayz standalone is dead or that the developers have taken the money and ran or that The_Community is dead quite frankly is full of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit the game is very much alive and so much better than it was when it started even though dayz sa has been slow off the start compared to other survivalist games h1z1 rust ark unturned miscreated etc i strongly believe it will come out on top as the best survivalist game when it is finished no other survival game has this much attention to detail and realism as dayz no other survival game has the kind of studio resources and money that bohemia has to put out a strong title no other survival game has mastered the hardcore aspect of survival and struggle better than dayz almost every other survival game was rushed out on a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit unreal engine in an effort to reap money off the survivalist scene and try to outbeat bohemia to the punch on features and gameplay games like rust and h1z1 fail to hit the bullseye on what a survival game should be dayz standalone does this right and does it good i would definitely recommend this game now as it s about to surpass the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit outta all other games on the market go out there and start surviving but be warned of the glitches thanks for reading i also might make a fps boost guide for dayz edit i made a dayz fps boost guide https steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails id 675608086"

Super_Meat_Boy,"ori and the blind forest looks like a simple platformer with similiarities to the new rayman games and Super_Meat_Boy i can assure you that while those accusations are true that is not a bad thing as it takes the best parts of both worlds and slams it together with a few new mechanics introduced frequently that keep the game fresh and exciting ori features a few new ideas including a skill tree in a platformer say what and parkour features like bash the skill tree offers alot of variety as in to what style you will play the game whether you want to have offence guidance or utility bash is one of my favourite mechanics as it makes very interesting puzzles fights and parkour the only thing original i ll rat on is the boring combat system i just feel like they could ve done at least aiming rather than a boring autolock attack they tried to spice it up by adding the charge bomb but i feel that it just kind of serves a purpose in the outside map not in combat the visuals are astounding i swear if you are not playing it on max qualities it s a sin every part of the game looks fantastic from the haunting mysterious misty woods to the enchantingly beautiful thornfelt swamp every part is an asset and a wonderful sight to see animation and effects look great too the main characters animations are a stand point from graceful ori to the slumpy naru and the scale and fright emitting from kuro attacks are bright and colourful which interact with the light of the background i can t live with out mentioning the soundtrack which has vocals that bring the tunes out of the game and into real life with you whistling at the grocery shop they all represent the moment they play in and add to the games already astounding atmosphere in summary i d say the ori and the blind forest is a bright and colourful rayman Super_Meat_Boy game with intriguing story mechanics music and gameplay i think the only negatives of the game would be the slightly under welming combat it s a bit short and some difficulty spikes but i find that like in Super_Meat_Boy this make it way more rewarding when you accomplish a difficult challenge overall rating 96 a must have for platformer enthusiasts please make a sequel moon studios"
Dota_2,"this game has extreme potential once australian servers are released and the characters have been balanced i see this game having a bright future however it would seem as though crafting will allow for pay to win the micro transactions within this game are its only current downfall i d reccomend the developer take a good long hard look at their current monetary scheme and rehaul it something like RIRE s purchase system or maybe like Dota_2 s set buying system chest unlockables and so on regardless as i said with proper balancing and a dedicated team this game could easily become a great moba 9 10"

Metro_2033,"such an amazing game especially when playing on ranger hardcore difficulty really gives you a glimpse of the hardships and shortage on supplies and ammo people would go through under such circumstances like an apocalypse the story is great and the fact that to get a good ending relies on more than just simple choices really makes this game try it out guys and play its predecessor Metro_2033 first"

The_Community,"i first started playing this mmorpg back in 2008 when it was first released and sure the graphics weren t so good back then but The_Community was great even though it lacked in some areas but made up for in others the class system aka job was clean cut and clear as how to where to do this and that there are plenty of party quest and hard dungeons that make a party important each class compliments each other customizable races are also pretty fun to muck around with at the beginning like making little sprites have big ti ahem moving on the game provides many challenges to take on which can take you on adventures from one to place to another last but not least how could i forget the pet system the pets are absolutlely adorable though the down side is that they take like a million years to level up but when you do manage to hit level 61 for the pet and mount it i guess it sort of makes it worth while having an amazing pet honestly when this game shut down i really thought this was the end for such an amazing game there were plenty fo bugs to be fixed but it was still great none the less but to be re released and to be on steam it s like a dream come true"
Csgo,"with all this micro transition crap going on people are over reacting have you tried using an ak a car 4 both of vanilla guns and still good and if you have got the big bank dlc you can use the eagle rifle which is really good imho the introduction of the safes and drills is just a poke at Csgo i wouldn t be surprised if Csgo realeses something to do with payday 2 soon so like to say i see what your doing there honestly the skins only give a bonus if you get the statboost variant everyone needs to stop acting like babies crying over something that you can now grind for drills and safes through cards also you have to realise that the only game that overkill is making money off right now is payday 2 unless you want them to go bankrupt because you dont like your overpowered guns not killing greens in oneshot in overkill means your kinda of selfish wait a bit by the start of next year this whole thing would of blown over and people would stop caring"
Tf2,"being that i have played this game for over 200 hrs over the last 2 years i can gladly say that this is one of the better games to have come out co op is fun to do and the game is pretty easy to learn how to play the sad thing is and its the reason i am no longer recommending this game is due to starbreeze including micro transactions to a game that didnt need them and was promised by the developer that it would nt be included developers need to look at what their consumers want out of their product rather than look at what other consumers of other developers want just because micro transactions work in Tf2 and cs go does not mean that it will work in this game not to mention promises made 2 years ago are still not done an example would be where is our safe house customization where are our 4day hiests sorry starbreeze but if you want a good review from me and a recommendation please fix your most current crimefest update ps we really do not need any more masks"
The_Community,"got some real annoying bugs like when i first alt tab back into it it goes into steam community shift tab when i go to run just recently died cause when i bailed out of my car since it was almost destroyed plowing through a horde tried to call in backup before getting mauled but since i pulled up the menu mid run it didn t work and just kept spamming me with the menu whenever i tried to change direction The_Community side missions are repetitive and are almost too frequent to do the main missions with unless you ignore it and let the people get unhappy since they aren t getting help are getting lost also i ve had a few zombies while jumping fences land inside the walls of buildings that they were previously outside and cars flip from pebbles on the road usually right beside a horde also the map system is horrid by todays standard but maybe i m just being a wuss expecting it to actually show a route to where i put a waypoint but it saves having to keep checking the map which doesn t pause the game other than that the engine is pretty good apart from previous stated bugs glitches that have occured the fact that you can change out to almost any character to keep your health up drugs for keeping it up in the field and designate where and what buildings you want in your base aswell as where the base is and set up outposts driving is rather easy but i hate hatchbacks too weak seems like a step up from project zomboid but when projzomb gets things like survivors and hopefully a better server browsing system the tables might turn"

Half_Life_2,"if god did not exist it would be necessary to invent him judging by the fact that you are reading this you have most likely glanced at the game of which this review is about and you may have noticed the fact the title is partnered with the ostentatious declaration of game of the year edition one of my biggest problems with this game is that it does not deserve such a title a more appropriate accolade would probably have to simply be deus ex game of century edition yes that s right i found a game that s better than Half_Life_2 deal with it 2012 me this is the part where one usually describes what the game is and a bit about the gameplay but deus ex has an exception but as a rule of thumb most people classify it under the simple and undeserving title of fps a name unworthy of such a masterpiece this is due to the seamless blend of rpg elements stealth and of course first person gameplay of the shooting variety and no fallout 3 is not a better example because bethesda never quite grasped what the words role playing mean and give out skill points in as plentiful quantities as the loading time in their games due to the excessive consolization that plagues this industry like the grey death of course the game is much more complex than this as you are not necessarily limited to sneaking around urban dystopia and secret laboratories one can simply go in guns blazing but this usually results in immediate death or in contrast can complete the entire game without killing a single person whatsoever the amount of choice and the way it reacts to your decisions is frightenly high but nothing is perfect the gunplay is fairly weak and the graphics and animations are fairly dodgy due to it running of the already fairly dated unreal engine the levels whilst very expansive and well designed are a bit boxy and bland even within the context of a ruined 2052 cyberpunk setting its true strength however lies within its story without spoiling too much it revolves around the player a nano augmented agent don t worry it is kind of explained in game called jc denton who works for unatco united nations anti terrorist coalition a group formed by the united nations in response to increasing global tensions including a terrorist strike on the statue of liberty the game was made in 200 so it was still perfectly fine to discuss terrorist attacks on new york but as the player fights the various organizations he starts to realise there is something very wrong with his overlords and finds himself a player in a secret war for world dominance the themes factions and events in the game are likely from a conspiracy theorist s nutty dream but simply keeping up to date wiht the state of the world simply provides foreshadowing for the dystopia presented in this game whilst most of the exposition and dialogue is extremely well written its delivery and voice acting is not as refined simply watch any play through of hong kong or paris to get the idea but i suppose there is some charm to hearing asian triads debate about philosophy in silly accents on the subject of sound it is quite obvious that the music does an excellent job of making up for the questionable voice acting when you first boot up a game and simply get chills from the title screen you know you ve got a gem in your hands all the the levels have an apprpaite soundtrack that suits them with seperate themes for ambient combat conversations and death ah hong kong never again will i be able to go anywhere remotely asian without feeling like stepping into wan chai market for the first time my final word is that you should absolutely buy this game it is very cheap 1 74 in a sale and there is simply no excuse for not playing this there is a well known phrase that every time you mention deus ex someone will reinstall it but this is complete bullocks because no one in their right mind would ever uninstall it it is the best 700mb on their hard drive the point being this is easily the best pc game if not the best overall game ever made it is really quite sad how no game has ever been able to match it after 14 years in terms of complexity and competency what a shame"

Evolve,"i was honestly surprised when i tried this out depth is a game that you don t come across regularly think of it like Evolved but with everything done right the gameplay is solid easy to pick up and pretty hectic keeping your cool while being stalked by player controlled sharks is a must i would recommend playing it with friends for me the experience was amazing with just one friend tagging along but don t go on my word alone check out some gameplay videos to see if its for you i had a blast i d give it a 8 10"

The_Community,"RIRE oh man this is a game i will always remember you want a short review on this game alrighty i should be able to give you one i ve played this game plenty just not on steam granted i ve not played this game in quite some time but there is one thing you must understand elite moderaters they are either going to be your best friend or they ll be some punk two year old that is crying over the fact that you son of a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit you re using a damn shotgun gtfo with the message of you ve been kicked out of the match by the elite moderater the game has a bit of a history with hackers i don t know if they ve fixed that but for some time elite mods were nexon s way to deal with it most of The_Community however if you were in a normal game lobby dispised the hacker as much as you did and wouldn t hesitate to vote kick his heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out"

Dota_2,"dota flippin 2 by a long shot my fav game to play on the good ol pc not like i play anything else though this game is prehaps one of the best freetoplay game ever ok correction is the best freetoplay game ever Dota_2 has a very sketchy begining for most players i really didnt see what was so good about at the begining it felt bland and not very exiting but after a few matches with my friends and a few good wins my life became dedicated to mastering this game and now ever after 503 hours i still have a very long way to go Dota_2 has a big learning curve at the begining as you ll here from every other player there are so many aspects of the game to learn but even at the begining it is insainly fun and as you develop your skill the game becomes more and more enjoyable and if you get really good you can assemble a worthy team and if our teams got the skillz to pay the billz you can run for the Dota_2 international championships however that an very very long shot but hey the prize money is 10 million flippin dollars this year and next year it will grow even bigger so why not try hey so go flippin get this game and waste thousands of enjoyable hours of your life doing no much and please please what ever you do dont play f king riki"

Tf2,"the review preludemy friend jacko has reminded me that this game is early access and cost me a whopping 99 cents aud the reviewif you have read my review of this game in the last few days it was a do not recommend with some frustration strewn throughout however i have now replayed it with controls set up in a way that actually works now this review is happily a recommend although there is a way to go the bulk of the game is there and appears to be solid enough oh and may i also recommend that you start playing as an assult class it is a simple class and one that gets you a feel for the game nicely the backgroundi played orion prelude and when this came out bam insta buy i finally get around to trying it and it s no longer first person view this may not be a deal breaker for you but that s what i love playing i ve been informed below that in version 1 5 fpv is back the gamethere are two modes of view top down third person and over the shoulder third person and the v1 5 first person things i like looks quite nice gtx 750 ti the harvester has a sense of humour dthere appears to be a lot of work gone into the tech upgrade tree hopefully this will allow for diverse specialised set ups for people now that i have proceeded past the initial shock of the change of view i can see why jacko again said that he really enjoyed his first play and made friends he s pretty easy to get along with when you first meet so that s a good sign i m yet to delve into the online version of this as my time was short things i don t like the jump binding is conveniently called roll dual purpose in actual fact the whole control system seems to very geared towards handheld controllers the game takes a while to load but shows no indication that it is indeed loading in fact it doesn t even show up on the taskbar making me think each time that it s frozen intel core i5 4690 2 5ghz 16gb ram win 10 the character that is you seems disconnected from the world that is to say that the world could be projected onto a wall and you just dance around in front of it for over the shoulder view the action of the grenade throw and the actual grenade movement is lame needs work early access certain characters ie assault insist upon saying look at me go every time you use the jetpack not a major gripe but i hope in the final release it gives that a break from 100 of the time discoveries f1 key switches between views thanks jacko despite you view not being first person out of the visor the world around you seems to move with your characters breathing and as i wrote above and you ll read in the comments in version 1 5 true first person view will be back i can t tell if it s my underspec d character or that the jump boost ceiling is very low but getting around up high is very hard if you do manage to get up above the ground only the dino flyers even attempt to get you most ground dinos become confused and don t necessarily even attempt their primary destructive objective there are hats Tf2 oh how you ve changed the world there are drops and chests to be found dem feelsmy initial feelings about this game was that i didn t get it i got the prelude but this one now that i have rejiggerd the controls and played it again on a simpler class i had more of an affinity for it so i m happier now the end biti m sure more things will come to light as i play this in multiplayer mode and i m glad i gave this game another chance i look forward to seeing where the devs take this thanks to jacko neomeinx and cjnfl for helping me with this review"

Half_Life_2,"vampire the masquerade bloodlines long name incredible game quite possibly the best game i have ever played i have reached the final boss several times but only finally got around to giving him his final death today taking around thirty hours this is a game complete with an amazing story interesting characters cool powers and the most legit vampire s i know of the basic story begins with your embrace where you become a vampire and continues as your rise in power and prestige until you are causing the events rather than reacting to them each of the nine clans you can choose from have different abilities they could be considered classes similar to other games but they aren t usually wildly different most of the change is in the player models and the powers each clan getting two powers from a pool and a third unique to their clan but there are enough differences to make replaying a possibility for example the nosferatu are hideous and as such can not seduce people for blood and instead have to suck on rats in the sewers below the streets while the ventrue clan is the opposite they can not drink from rats due to their nobility another is clan malkavian each and every one of them is insane incredibly they have 100 unique dialogue opposed to other clans having a few lines or opportunities each and can engage in some interesting tangents such as having a conversation with the news reporter on tv while the vanilla version is very buggy due to the developers being rushed in their final stages most of these issues can be resolves with the fan made unofficial patch which is a must get if you plan on playing it s not the prettiest game either with some pretty terrible animations at times but all this is forgiveable in the face of such a wonderful experience the game uses valve s source engine an earlier version of the engine titanfall is built on and was released on the same day as Half_Life_2 and though the models in the game are by no means of equal quality they are attractive in their own way and help nail the bleak horror noir atmosphere if firefly was a game it would be this one while the themes are not at all similar it is the kind of game that when someone brings it up in conversation or you read about it on the net you pretty much have no choice but to reinstall and have another crack at it 10 10 i honestly can not think of any way to improve it other than give the devs more time to improve a couple of the cutscenes tl dr v tm b is one of the best games ever it is often on sale on steam buy it install the most recent unofficial patch enjoy the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out of it p s heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit the haunted hotel the game isn t all that scary though some bits are somewhat disturbing the hotel always gets me"

Terraria,"let me tell of a recent adventure i had while playing this with my friend we started on a large island wasn t as large as i thought it would be but it was large enough of course we started gathering woods first so we could have a shelter for the first night whereas my friend focused more on the framework i focused more on making our shelter look pretty by adding a japanese themed roof once we placed the last chair the guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his our first night wasn t bad we just stayed inside made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range so for the whole night we shot zombies with our bows and arrows the rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that we collected woods and sometimes stones improved on our shelter which eventually turned into a tower and eventually mined we kept mining a specific network which in time lead us to the underworld now mind you we played on hardcore so if i died then i die for good on that server anywho our first trip to the underworld wasn t too bad we made a hellevator and rode it down to the underworld we scouted for a bit until we were attacked by demons when we lost more that 50 of our health we knew it was time to go back and so we teleported back home with our magic mirrors so from that day forward our mission was to mine the hell out of hell now this is where the story ends i thought for sure that i would have died from a demon or fell and slipped into lava but no it was from something else entirely i decided to discover more of the network of caves and hope to find treasure chests here and there but no i stepped on a pressure plate and a boulder fell on me i died while my friend laughed and stole my items that was when i stopped playing Terraria then update 1 3 came and i was like yipee i wonder what other deadl y contraptions redigit has in store for me pls excuse bad inggris"

The_Community,"this is an australian review everything mentioned is on australian servers dont buy it it will just make you mad The_Community in this is possibly worse then ebola and it gave me autism occasionally you will have a game where the outcome is not influenced by lag or unbalanced builds characters but the majority of your games will be laggy cluster heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit s of overpowered spam i have played 400 hours and have become thouroughly addicted for your mental and physical health and safety i dont recommend this game edit every patch they break it even more in the name of balance there is no balance here"
Dota_2,"a never ending bucket of fun laughs anguish anger and hate Dota_2 has huge amounts of variety you will probably find yourself compelled to better yourself and pull your weight on the team the game is constantly evolving keeping gameplay fresh and the endless supply of other players and strategies combined with the vast amount of playable characters heroes items and game modes makes every game mostly unique the gameplay is reliant on your strategy decisions timing and luck the game is difficult not to enjoy as even a one sided loss can teach you and you can still have a good time even if your face gets stomped in the only real downside is that you occasionally come across a jerk but that is to be expected in an online game"

Tf2,"i picked up this game for a solid key and i must say it was worth it entirely this game is extremly fun to play and knocking players from your favourite games such as clap trap and sam of the table is very enjoyable however there is a minor set back that may swing if you want to buy this game or not and that is the in game items that you can obtain from this game for Tf2 and borderlans in poker night 1 it was random and the players would put their items up however now you have to complete a set of challenges then knock every player of the table in order to win the item i find this fun and challenging but i can see why people wouldn t like this change would reccomend picking poker night 1 up as well"

Evolve,"don t get me wrong the game is great but i simply can t let these issues go by why i don t care about the f2p change the game was dying so they made it free to try to save their game am i heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off for losing 60 bucks yes i am but they had to do this or i would never have the chance to enjoy this game again also the founders edition gives people who bought the game a lot of stuff they also promised to make even more little things for the people who have been supporting them since the start this means that us founders the people who really cared for this game will continue to get more exclusive itens in short the reason for this review isn t the f2p change it s because of the stupid ways they changed the game to please idiots who played 2 minutes of the game and started screaming heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit about the it cof cof angryjoe cof cof what they have heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ed up they made the dome a shared ability something i do not agree with since it takes away a huge part of being a trapper and also discourages teamwork also you can t miss but that barely scraches the surface of the problem they also added regenerative health and even though it s already way too fast there are perks that can greetly speed it up the medic only becomes useful during combat which now it s the focus of the game there s no such thing as stealth there s only planet scanners every 30 seconds who force the monster to constantly run actually he doesn t need to run because he can teamwipe at stage 1 in fact they should call this game not Evolve they also decreased the dropship time to a minute and a half there goes one of emet strengts what they turned the game into in short they turned a game about hunting into a massive monster batteling cluster heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit made Evolve not worth evolving and destroyed teamwork this game is broken gameplaywise and they need to remove this friendly piece of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit mechanics that they decided to add people who started playing now won t even notice but we do and if this doesn t get changed we will forever miss what Evolve used to be ps where did all the maps and modes go"
Evolve,"awesome game horrible company like Evolve microtransactions have been added to the game even after the developers saying that they would never ever do it these horrible greedy companies have been doing this for a while now but overkill got to a whole new heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing level they gave us their word and then 3 years after they spit and throw this garbage at your face and tell you to eat it hoping that you forgot their promise i ll tell you what if you re that type of idiot who buys call of duty every year plus all the dlcs go ahead get into this cluster heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit whoever if you have any brain cells left in your little head after being brainwashed by reading all the positive reviews don t buy this don t be a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit don t accept this right up your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit this is a warning if people accept this it ll become acceptable like dlcs what s next overkill do you plan on becoming an ea division because i ll tell you something you re going on the right heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing direction you deserve to die because everyone in this heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing company are simply money heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit s did i made my point well i think i did get your refund before it s too late"

Csgo,"wouldnt think that valve could create a good game Csgo is popular now and is very good with more modern weapons than it counter parts cs cz css but what i think makes the game good is the ability to add custom skins to all weapons including knives the down side to the game is the competitive side the elo system is broken and theres players not in the correct ranks so it does make ranking harder to gain unless you play with higher ranked friends in a team"

Portal,"after finishing Portal i thought all the fun was over in terms of pissfarting around when i bought Portal 2 for 5 i had a coupon i thought maybe it still was possible i found the levels were considerably harder than the first one s and the storyline was much longer and somehow a tad more humerous the introduction of different features and new multiplayer support really amazed me even though i bought it for a quarter of its price i still think it would be worth the 20 plus it has controller support so that s cool"
Csgo,"what used to be a game with a vibrant community the developers decided they would milk the cash cow hard and hard it was they decided they would put microtransactions in an effort to give players a feeling like that of a competitive game such as Csgo this is a 4 player co op not a pvp"

Tf2,"great game regardless the fact that its still beta with forgivable glitches the best thing about this is it is one of those few games that arent pay 2 win and you dont need a tryhard computer to actually enjoy it its a concoction of the teamwork of Tf2 with the gunplay of cod although i would recommend the devs to add more guns for one merc and a customization option"

The_Community,"i wish i could provide a more externsive review of the game however it kepy crashing in the prologue the fact that i couldn t save the game meant i had to replay it many times only to enjoy more crashes and begin again that aside the camera controls were awkward and controlling your hero was pretty annoying the fact that your heroes auto used skills and spells felt like there was little need for me to control anyone and that i was simply there to try and tell them where to move and let them do the rest which they were more than capable of dealing without me i asked for a refund on this one simply because of the controls and constant crashes unless The_Community builds some impressive content after the game is heavily patched i d not recommend"
The_Community,"if you ever wanted proof beyond a doubt that this game was developed on the wrong side of the border in korea you just have to try tree of savior where everything under the sun is locked down i am pretty sure this is not imc s first mmo rodeo but to hold The_Community to ransom due to gold traders and thereby remove the massively out of mmo is not conducive nor giving them any points live everyday thinking how the spiritual successor could have been better then move on to something else come back a year after f2p and see if things have settled atm you are paying ea to get stonewalled as you level further"

Undertale,"if you are here and reading this and you want to make a review about how this game isn t good it s gon na be hard Undertale is a rpg like a bunch of others the story is just sorta a no and a yes the game is a feel trip and that s a bad thing not just because it makes you sad it s mainly because it can t make this 1 person not sad at all for 1 game character also the pixelly artwork is meh normal in my opinion the controls are fine as expected for an overrated game i mean who doesn t know a good game has good controls right ha anyways let s move on to the music the music is alright pretty normal for an rpg yet there was some where they were just very meh and that s just my taste in music you might find it badass or something but i don t like it so that s just my opinion theres something in Undertale i think is missing and the game itself is just terrible and good yes the main reason i am giving this a bloody no no is mainly because of the fact of the story and vibe you can t just find out what the story is how frisk got into the place maybe falling down dragged down or something the story isn t explained just right hell even finding out the monsters creation yes of course games like legend of zelda and other games might have this heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit but their just from like not completely explained from their existance that is sorta explained in loz oot itself also the characters they are meh good also if i didn t already write that anyways 4 9 10 this is just my opinion you should buy it still even if it s a no no for me enjoy your game once you got it"

The_Community,"rustset in a post nuclear apocalpyse where the world is brutal and the people that inhabit it are even more so you forage mine chop and kill to survive build bases to keep your booty safe and hope someone doesn t come along to take it and your pants what rust lacks in story it makes up for with the interactions of its other inhabitants one minute you could be taking a nice stroll along the road next minute a naked person will try to smack you in the head with a rock what do you do kill them make peace run away that choice is up to you your adventures would also entail building a base that is if you want to keep all the stuff you find which may end up stolen in the future if you aren t vigilant i find rust to be a great game no matter how much people say that The_Community is bad in my experiences so far i ve met people who will help you and those that will destroy you the game is all about your interactions with players without them it s just not as enjoyable my personal rating for rust is a 10 10 because it can be so damn great no matter how much you rage"
Evolve,"blockstorm this is one of those games that can give a large amount of replayability the game features a few gamemodes such as deathmatch team deathmatch capture the flag and assault the gameplay is well put and will be very familiar if you have ever played the original ace of spades and not the piece of crap remake the game also features two editors a map editor and a character editor the editors at first seem diffcult but once you find out what does what you should be able to use them just fine the main thing i like about this game is the fact that you can have your own personalised character skin which you create yourself which can take some time i d recommend people buy this game now while it is still in the early stages so you can see the game Evolve into something greater i m even sure once more people find out about this game it will top that shotty remake of ace of spades so come on down and join the battle 10 10"

Tf2,"such a funny game takes the seriousness and enjoyment of poker and removes the stress with fun tables and cards and absolutely hilarious lines i d recommend removing the censor but that s just my preference tycho swears a ton it can get a little frustrating after you lose a few games in a row or when you re trying to get a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit straight flush but it s enjoyable in other ways you don t actually lose money you can enjoy poker without stress the other guys say some really funny lines and of course the reason why 60 of you buy this game the Tf2 items a police badge a sweet pistol some slick shades sasha and a bloody watch but this game isn t just about the Tf2 items i bought it because i wanted to enjoy it and took the items as a bonus it is quite fun to strategise how to win the game and how to target a certain item without ing up and that feeling when you get a flush a full house or a straight and you destroy everyone else s hands or when you win with a pair of twos this game is so much more than 5 of Tf2 items highly recommend"

Evolve,"this was the first ever game i got on steam let me say its still as entertaining now it s the final capstone of the dawn of war series and it does it s job it has a mostly rich campaign that was well thought out has a degree of difficulty and makes sense now it s not as rts ish as the first dawn of war games however it s kind of Evolved to feel more like tabletop good points a choice of three characters per army in multiplayer each multiplayer faction eldar space marines orks tyranids chaos space marines imperial guardsmen has a trio of unique heroes to use to represent you in game mostly these generals fall into offense defense support there are also stealth and teleportation heroes but they are fewer than those three imperial guardimperial guard has the inquisitor as offense the commissar lord as support and the lord general as defense the inquisitorthe inquisitor mostly focuses on purge everything with fire and she does it well her main weapon wargear gives her abilities to combat small amounts of powerful foes and large amounts of less thans with relative ease she does however fall off against tanks and super heavies a little but i mean come on the commissar lord the commissar lord focuses around boosting nearby squads and nearby squads boosting him sound a bit cryptic well a certain peice of wargear he can get boosts his health regeneration depending on how many nearby friendly squads there are other than this he is also superior for demoralizing and debuffing enemy troops reducing damage output tankability etc unfortunatly he too suffers against tanks and superheavies not looking good for guardsmen huh the lord general so the other two fall off against tanks and superheavies well here is redemption the lord general is followed by a personal squad that get the same weapon as he does upgrade him with flamer burn all the troops upgrade with melta astala heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off tanks on this topic when you give him a meltagun he gains the ability to turn nearby allies gun cooldown to 0 gun cooldown wtf does that mean it s basically the reload of a gun or the time between bursts that a gun fires hence it has no boost on flamers but on autocannons that fire basically miniature rockets space marineswelcome to the fanboy s wet dream the space marines have a captain for offense apothecary for healing and techmarine for defense the captainwelcome to the all you can eat anti everything extraveganza he s basically a glorified sargent who can be upgraded to specialise against everything that not enough for you well then look no further he can be upgraded into tactical dreadnaught armor aka terminator armor which takes away most of his options of weapons and stuff but as the name suggests gives you a hell of a lot of resistance while in termy armor you can equip an assualt cannon good against heavy troops a heavy flamer good against light troops and twin power claws good against anything the apothacaryas his name and specialty suggests the apothacary s strength lies in his ability to keep units and even allied heroes alive when giving the sanguine chainsword and put with a personal squad of assualt terminators this guy just wont go down easily his global abilities also allow him to revive allied heroes from anywhere on the map pretty nifty the techmarinenot really much to see here he s kind of just your normal defense archtype can build turrets and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit and is fairly tanky chaos space marinesthe chaos space marines mine and my best friend s personal favorite for offense they have the mighty chaos lord for defense the putrid plague champion and for support the sorceror the chaos lord this guy is the biggest cheese around you know how i said terminator armor was an upgrade for the captain well this guy gets it free he has superior anti hero capability and all around anti everything unfortunatly i havent played him much so i cant tell you much more than that the plague champion this guy is my bro while the apothacary can keep his guys alive this guy can simultainiously do that kill enemies and give toughness auras not only this but his anti infantry capability is absolutely amazing he is capable of destroying 5 squads of guardsmen with a single dot grenade alongside this he also give global abilities to boost this further like making a highly damaging cloud that tears through squads and an ability that once enemies die they come back for a little bit as mo heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing zombies the sorcerorthis guy is just heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit your turrets normally you d have to waste a few guys flanking base turrets with this badass you can teleport him behind their turrets and then use a global to bring every unit you control to him ez 13zthe eldarthis is actually getting boring quickly and i m still on the first good point can i stop now sanyway other good points story mode and multiplayer are amazing and have few bugs last stand despite a few bad points is actually the reason i love this game bad points last stand has lots of bugs and some characters have very little background and thats it gg"
Terraria,"so apparently people seem to think that this is 2d minecraft no it is not minecraft is a 3d sandbox builder with rpg elements while Terraria is more like an rpg with sandbox elements so Terraria starts you off pretty well you have one of each major tool discounting hammer an axe sword and pick as it goes you must make a small house on your first day to make sure not to get rekt at nighttime then you have to make a small town for npcs to come while they re not completely neccessary and it is possible to go through the whole game without them you re gon na have a real hard time because that means no shroomite which is an extremely useful hardmode resource it also means you have to make your own bullets and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit and man ain t nobody got time for that infact i think without npcs you have to make do with arrows sux anyway then you basically dig some crap make some armor beat some bosses stress out when you enter hardmode and suddenly biomes start corrupting everything and you just have no idea what is going on and pretty much after that you can do whatever the hell you want all in all i really like this game it s really quite fun and there s a lot to do got bored of building fight a boss got bored of fighting bosses go dungeonaring got bored of dungeonaring consider building stuff oh yeah and look out for wyverns i give this a 8 5 10 c"

Undertale,"well if you looking for a game with terrible gameplay cliche story and the most uninteresting characters ever created then your in the wrong place this game is a masterpeice and deserves all the praise its been getting the gameplay is extremely unique since it mixes jrpg elements with bullet hell this was a brilliant idea all the characters are extremely interesting i dont think i came across one enemy that i thought was boring this can also be said for the music the music in this game omg where do i start the music is amazing and clearly has had a lot of time put into creating the perfect tune for each encounter oh by the way the game is extremely funny and is self realised from every little joke made at almost averything you interact with Undertale surprisingly has a really in depth morality system that will remember everything you did in your playthrough this effects greatly how the story will play out and even goes on to shape how your next run will go now heres where the game hooks you the most the feelsi dont think ive ever been as emotionaly scared Undertale does a brilliant job at making you feel like what your doing matters from showing mercy and making friends with everyone to being a completely psychopathic murderer oh and if you thought that you can just reset the game and try again if you say accidentally kill someone well your going to have a bit of a surprise when you run into them again thats all i m goint to say and yes this game has great replay value since there are multiple endings that are actually vastly different from each other so overall this game is a must buy trust me you wont regret it"

The_Community,"anyone not interested in backstory skip to next paragraph well i have a lot to say about this game two years ago as a person who was sick of all the physics builders where you build something extremely fragile and watch it crash into a wall and explode i was looking for something new and different one day i turned steam on and in the daily feed that always pops up i saw a new game had just been released on steam called robocraft immediately interested i downloaded the game and found myself in literally exactly what i had been looking for ever since i first discovered minecraft a battle arena game where you build your contestants literally from scratch the devs actively published new updates that improved the game and for a good year robocraft was the best and only game i ever routinely played a lot has changed since then the devs released this game with the intentions of keeping it as not only a free to play f2p game but a free to win game as well one where nothing that actually altered the gameplay would be locked behind paywalls this is one of the issues i would like to talk about the old system had you earning a certain amount of rp the currency previously used that you could spend on pretty much anything except for cosmetic parts which didn t affect gameplay at all you earned a decent amount from playing and each day all of your bots in each garage before you started with 3 garages and had to pay for more would have a 2x multiplier on your score from your first victory each day with each bot this system allowed you to get what you wanted when you wanted it now with the crate drop system your hard earned winnings are completely randomized one day you could get essentially nothing the next you could get the rarest items in crate after crate this system has more or less been fine with the endgame players and beginners but the middle class of players those who had been playing for a little while and were working their way up got hit hard you need a tank track to finally complete that bot but don t have enough robits to forge one too bad you got a hover blade or some cubes that s not even mentioning the horrible and broken economy check the subreddit one of my friends posted an explanation on how the system is broken the roboshop has also ruined the game once if you wanted a great bot you had to make it yourself or at least build it from the ground up with a guide both of which taught you a lot on how to build a robot but now you can buy an overpowered bot from the shop without lifting a finger this massively destroys the whole feel of the game as you aren t forced to learn how to make a bot better cause if it isn t you can just dismantle it and buy a new one finally the devs aren t listening to their community they claim that the game is forged from The_Community s feedback but if it was epic loot wouldn t exist or at least would be made with a much better economy if you don t get what you want from a crate you can simply reforge it or so was the idea let s use a legendary as example to buy a mega smg it costs 125 00 robits to sell one on the other hand you would only get 31 250 meaning it would take you 4 mega smg s among the hardest items to randomly get in the game to make 1 what kind of economy is that tl dr robocraft used to be good the tiers more or less worked at least better than it does now we didn t have or even want some of the items we do now and the economy is not only bad but also broken the devs need to start listening to their community and bending the game to how the players want to play my advice wait don t get the game as it is now and see if the devs finally change it to be fun as it used to be"

Super_Meat_Boy,"my first impressions were good it worked with castle crashers and lego star wars but with other games not so lucky on big picture mode if the gane says not controller compatible it means it and not all games work with the controller i have binded my contollers on left 4 dead 2 which is actually compatible Super_Meat_Boy or whatever other games were compatible with the controller but don t work for some reason use the usb cord that this hardware comes with that plugs in with a xbox 360 one controller plug it into that and use that contoller it usually has automatic binding and on a game like half life you just go to setting and usually says enable gamepad and it works 100 of the time"

The_Community,"i am in the middle with this game don t get me wrong i love it but so many flaws on this game i mean it s a tremendously welcome game for pretty much anyone but turtle rock studios screwed us over with this game if you look down you can t see your lower body and there isn t any servers that aren t modded in any god forsaken way and don t get me started with The_Community all they ever do is kick me for having a vocalizer or if i screw up once in versus and then there is the l4d1 map ports i would love to be able to see the melee weapon on the l4d1 characters without mods but no i guess they magically float in your intestine and then there is the person that thinks it s a good idea to team kill everyone so here s my vote 10 10 if your playing with friends 1 10 if your playing with people who just got this game teamkillers or randoms"

The_Community,"from the very first videos that promoted this game prior to its launch on steam the game looked impressive melding a voxel game similar in nature to another popular game to a deformable physics platform set in space from it official launch in 2013 space engineers has been in early access by no means has it been a smooth ride but each week the developers have been adding to and improving the game adding features requested by The_Community as well as adding their own particular enhancements the game has grown substantially in that time making space engineers an impressive multiplayer sandbox experience the developers have hinted at many new things on the horizon which will no doubt improve the game play immensely and expand the playability when they are released in the coming months i ve personally spent more hours playing this game than any other in my steam catalogue and hope to continue playing for a long time to come if you like building stuff if you like smashing stuff if you like flying space ships if you like exploring massively open space if you like encountering random procedurally generated items if you like building flying model replicas of famous scifi ships if you like competing with players to build the biggest meanest ship to pit against one another if you like experimenting with physics if you like The_Community experience of sharing things you have made if you like a game with a large community following if you like a game where players can actively contribute modifications to expand the game if you seeing a developer actively spending time to improve their game then please consider having a look at space engineers"
Terraria,"Terraria is awesome"
Portal,"my favorite game is Portal 2 great puzzles graphics and of course the amazing humor and most interesting characters in a game you can t go wrong with Portal 2 worth it dosn t even describe how soon you should get this game you can create and upload your own maps making the game last forever and play co op with a friend a must play game 10 10 a center masterpeice of gaming"
The_Community,"0 10 because review scores are heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t this game had potential but quickly turned into a cash grab for sms and became a joke of an e sports contender with all of The_Community events in 2016 focusing soley on the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t e sports market most cars and tracks are old models from other sms games and the only insult to it is the price to pay for it some car classes are broken by the dlc cars throwing old road cars in with old race cars or mixing f1 cars the 72d will never keep up with the 78 ai selection is absent too so doing a mixed field gt race will have all the cars with gt in their title in the field ever wanted to race against a gt40 while doing the bathurst 12 hour in a gt4 mustang while still having the gt3 cars to overtake you too bad there also seems to be a load of bugs still during online races i would often get wrecked just by tapping wheels one time even being wrecked because the game glitched the grid placing another car under me the ffb took me a year to get to a level where i could enjoy driving it being a confusing mess and i only sorted it when i stopped using ffb setups that would be considered normal in my other wheel based games ai is great in this game aside from a few bugs that have the ai pit on the last lap of a race if it starts raining which ruined a perfect enduro race i staged but aside from a few buggy classes of vehicles most of the rest can kerb hop and battle for position sometimes if the game doesn t go and supercharge them like it is prone to do you can have some fun with this game offline it is a decent simcade mode as i have said before with other racing sims wait until the second game and even then give it a few months before buying this one to see if the 2nd game can be improved over this mess which could have cornered the gran turismo for pc market that some of us have been waiting for since gt turned to crap"
Terraria,"a game of almost infinite possibilities Terraria is a superb game but eventually you will have finished the game and be given nothing in reward besides that this is an excellent game go but it its cheap lots of playtime"
Well_There,"Well_There is a bad side and a good side but i honestly think that the bad side is too much i think the the multiplayer is kinda bad and maybe i dont play it well but you will die too quick so its not gon na be easy and many other issue that you will find in this game but the good side is the story mode is a pretty well done job and the aliens mode is pretty fun but if you are like me that finds game fun only in shooting other people in games i would think that this game is not that great of a multiplayer though its only my opinion some of you might not agree with me because each people have a different opinion so yeah if your looking for a new mode in call of duty well you should try this but like i said if your more of a multiplayer shooting players vs players guy than i would highly recommend not to waste your 60 peace"
Well_There,"this game is amaising i love everything about it Well_There i sone thing and that is that the storage crates have only 4 slots but still it is an amaising game plus it was made by a single 16 year old wow if you like games based on survival and looting and zombies than this is for you cant wait for more updates"

Evolve,"fun cool and brings back some good memories of fighting grunts and elites in new mombasa but it gets really tedious and and constantly running up and down the map to complete objectives a lot of running around the map and too little gun blazing like the halo that i know it s a mobile game so dont expect much though it s really good it should have just stayed as a mobile game controls a bit challenging and not as easy and using ur mouse to aim and shoot not much story but still nice however even with that it s still really cool how they made the game from a bird s eye view unlike the fps version guns are cool and all but lack the real halo feel the no reload thing is ok but find it hard to keep a gun for long before needing to find another or getting more ammo but kinda disappointing overall for a halo game really should have stayed on mobile unless u are the new comer of halo the people who played from halo combat Evolved wouldnt enjoy it as it feels different from the originals it s really mixed feelings for this as it s a halo title and i m a huge fan of it but this game does not live up to that name mobile or not nice and cool for a new view and all but would not reccomend if u are a long time lover of halo just to save u from the dissapointment for others to try out this it s nice to get a game that somewhat feels like halo just to get u into the feel of halo before entering console if u were considering i m not saying this game sucks its nice and good and cool and stuff for new players but old timers wouldnt like it reccomended for new players first time players but for long time fans it could be a huge disappointment"

Terraria,"okay so when people think of adventure what do they imagine they will usually think about killing stuff with swords n lazers and stuff Terraria is exactly like that but in 2d and it has squares do you like squares nice because this game has a lot of them the story of this game starts with nothing because this game has no story it just drops you in the middle of a world you must exploit to survive and live and kill and do some other stuff the main objective of the game is to kill the wall of flesh that is exactly what it is a wall made of flesh and when you do it you unlock the hard mode if you alredy thought this game was troubling you prepare yourself because it was just warming up in general this is a good game has nice music appealing graphics at least for the type of game it is a 2d pixel adventure sandbox it also it s very easy to understand how to play has some really useful npc s aand also there is a dr who reference bowties are cool Terraria is a game i recommend for people that like 2d sandbox adventure titles or just whoever it s intrested"

Tf2,"Tf2 is a great fps multiplayer expirience and it is just a big bonus that it is free this game has some very unique gameplay experience mainly that there are 9 very different classes that are genuinely fun to play there is also a very large amount of unique weapons most of them are very fun to use pretty much my only critisism is that valve havn t added weapons for quite a while overall this is an amazing experience that is very entertaining i give it 9 25 10"
Team_Fortress_2,"Team_Fortress_2 at least what i think ias a brilliant game and it s avalability to mac aswell as windows make it even better althought definetly nothing new being released in 2006 and not to mention the time for download the game is still definetley one of my favourites by far this game has lots of free dedicated servers as well as constant updates and for me so for far in my 200 hours of gameplay contains very little lag not to mention still quite a popular game with lots of people playing it even after 8 years after inital release"

Team_Fortress_2,"yes i only have 9 minutes but on my old ds i can assure you i have at least 100 hours logged into it this will be a serious review so no ak 47 dlcs sp00kiness or memes here the game is pretty simple the premise is that you re raising adorable cuddly cats and the whole game focuses on your progression and here s why i think this is worth a buy it s a good time consumer sicne this is geared for children mainly i ll focus on why its good for them and then coem to why at any age this can be a good game the game is simple but isnt simple to where it can be called boring challenges start out bland which are mainly just tutorials on how to get the cat fed and such but do rise up in difficulty somewhat but not enough to irritate most children the progression systemmay not be as advanced as alot of other games out there but i m sure your child isnt a huge expert in the games industry but jsut because it isnt extremely emmersive it doesnt mean its trash you progress by your cat becoming more affectionate towards you clothing for them more minigames and other things that i cant remember its been years now this game isnt something that can be played hardcore you cant log in 100 hours in a week with this maybe just an hour or two per every few days after school or while you and spouse if present are working another core feature of this game that can make it better than any ipad game which i do see a majority of young children playing video games on ipads but i m not an expert on what the most popular platform young children play video games on is that it has no microtransactions what are microtransactions some may ask microtransactions are small fees in the game which are ultimately for you to take money out of your pocket and put it into the developers examples of this are like diamonds used to speed build a building that takes 12 hours to build or more lives on candy crush the game is a one purchase deal you get all the hours of enjoyment and content through the single purchase of 9 99 which ulitmately can save you alot more money than you think and when it goes on sale definately is something to consider buying edit this game can run on any computer it doesnt have the powerful graphics ability that many games possess today so dont worry about purchasing new parts now for those who ve gotten past the age of 10 it s a simple game with simple mechanics and a pretty out of date engine it isnt meant to have extreme and powerful graphics its from 2007 it s jsut a time killer really i just play this game at night when counter strike and Team_Fortress_2 get pretty boring and i want something to help me potentially fall asleep i know that since you re older you have other games you wan na buy so really i recommend this as a sale only buy overall rating 8 10 fun in short bursts simple concept and nostalgic"

Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"full review updatethe latest crimefest content has forced me to now give a negative rating this game is now literally paid to win as weapon skins which can only be purchased with real money provide stat boosts as if dlcs that provide attachments that also provide stat boosts are not enough everything else is copied from Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive including the rarity safes keys and the inspect weapon animation shame on you overkill will not recommend storylinethere is not much plot to payday 2 which is staged in washington dc and you are offered contracts by various key contractors who either request you help trasport narcotics rob a bank rob a big bank rob a engine prototype or simply changing election results in favour of four men all votes instead of one man one vote community suggestions also led to introduction of new weapons and the break out of a fellow heister who was sabotaged however some other extremely common community suggestions appear to be ignored or unaddressed gameplaythe heists are dynamic in a sense as camera placements loot quantities and placements as well as guard routes can change every time the map is played similar to that of left 4 dead 2 different events can also happen for the same heist and pose a challenge to the players although some do get annoying at times and when you ve played long enough you ll become experienced enough to handle the same old variations some of the heists are also quite short lived as they can end as quickly as they were started and there are not much objectives in the heists making the robberies highly repetitive and likely boring a new friend of mine was shocked at the completion of the heist within 3 minutes newer heists such as the big bank heist and hoxton breakout provide a quicker pace and a longer fight between the law enforcers and you but similarly it does not provide much variations as such the game has a balance of good and dull heists i had expected better seeing the awards though there are four difficulties ranging from normal to death wish where overkill would be the commonest difficulty when you re experienced and death wish would provide a truly engaging experience unless you are stealthing and have not been caught however if you are new to the game don t be eager to start in these high difficulties although normal difficulty is truly boring even for a low level you can heist in singleplayer mode which limits you to yourself and 2 team ai bots or you can play multiplayer with 3 other players the singleplayer mode which can be played offline is annoying as overkill reduced the number of bots from 3 to 2 although the bots are tank on their own and can regenerate health and ammo the bots lack skills and ability to help transport loot making the player all on their own to carry out the goals bots can also be interrupted by law enforcers and makes it extremely annoying when they stop reviving you to fight back even when you re going to custody in a second or the revival would complete in a second bots are also essentially useless in stealth missions and all they do is to prepare in case the heist gets loud in multiplayer things are more interesting and payday 2 mainly revolves around multiplayer as different user interactions definitely makes the heist experience a more unique one bugs are also common to an extent in payday 2 while some are fixed in the following few patches others appear to be unresolved from day one till now graphicsplaying on 1920 x 1080 resolution there has not been any major gameplay affecting pixelation yet and the lighting effects are not over emphasised which can cause the light bulbs to be brighter than the sun the law enforcers faces especially the snipers do look contorted though and probably can be improved some jagged edges are visible though unlikely to be noticed in normal gameplay graphic designs are however in general not neglected walls are vandalised with graffiti instead of being left blank food menus in the cafe stores are actually filled up and paintings can be destroyed that being said the textures and details are often extremely blurred such as the bank branding on atm doors and food products even if you argue that the grafitti blurred out due to age it s too blurred for any monitor with a resolution greater than 720p or somewhere there although this game is a few years old with the constant updates and huge game file size you would think it has better graphics than the current outdated one character feature s payday 2 follows system similar to that of rpg where there are 5 skill trees and several perk builds for you to choose from you gain skill points upon leveling up and perk points upon receiving xp although more dynamic compared to payday 1 as every player will now have slightly different builds and thus different abilities compared to a high level player which simply has everything the grinding can get tedious once you have reached level 70 or 80 this has been more or less rectified with the xp changes and it has been much easier to level up since then payday 2 also allows more customisation compared to payday 1 where you can customise the mask colour pattern and texture instead of simply choosing the masks this allows more than a few million combinations for masks to choose from although some are downright unappealing masks are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay other than showing your artistic sense weapons can also be customised using the limited range of weapon modifications which can be extended via dlc to gain access to better or more flexible mods some mods are achievement locked and require you to grind for them musicthe soundtracks suits the gameplay rather well tensing up when law enforcement assault starts and slowing down when it ends giving an additional brief respite depending on the heist the soundtrack was based on it can be classical music a retro styled music or even just exciting music that you can follow to the soundtrack dlc is needed if you want the mp3 or flac files which further allows you to customise your in game soundtracks without the need to purchase other heist dlcs for the soundtrack pricingrefer to update verdictat its age i would have expected more than dlc locked content which are pumped out more often than free content which wouldn t have mattered as much if the dlcs are more reasonably priced despite the potential in the game i am upset that the game has evolved into one that is simply money making without actual new content we are not robbing banks guys we are the ones getting robbed here"
Evolve,"full review updatethe latest crimefest content has forced me to now give a negative rating this game is now literally paid to win as weapon skins which can only be purchased with real money provide stat boosts as if dlcs that provide attachments that also provide stat boosts are not enough everything else is copied from Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive including the rarity safes keys and the inspect weapon animation shame on you overkill will not recommend storylinethere is not much plot to payday 2 which is staged in washington dc and you are offered contracts by various key contractors who either request you help trasport narcotics rob a bank rob a big bank rob a engine prototype or simply changing election results in favour of four men all votes instead of one man one vote community suggestions also led to introduction of new weapons and the break out of a fellow heister who was sabotaged however some other extremely common community suggestions appear to be ignored or unaddressed gameplaythe heists are dynamic in a sense as camera placements loot quantities and placements as well as guard routes can change every time the map is played similar to that of left 4 dead 2 different events can also happen for the same heist and pose a challenge to the players although some do get annoying at times and when you ve played long enough you ll become experienced enough to handle the same old variations some of the heists are also quite short lived as they can end as quickly as they were started and there are not much objectives in the heists making the robberies highly repetitive and likely boring a new friend of mine was shocked at the completion of the heist within 3 minutes newer heists such as the big bank heist and hoxton breakout

Tf2,"short review virtual hat simulator with cash full review storylinethe plot is simple there is a war going on between the builders league united blu and reliable excavation demolition red both subsidiaries of tf industries however due to problems lacking an obvious bureaucratic solution mercenaries are contracted to address the situation through war you join one of the two teams not permanently and play as one of the nine mercenaries hereby named classes which each has its own unique features in a war to attack defend e g payload attack defend control points or to gain control e g king of the hill 5cp special delivery gameplay classesthe nine classes all play an important role in the game and having too many or the lack thereof of one class leads to an imbalanced team causing the team to suffer heavy penalties in terms of co operating to push towards their objective the nine classes scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer sniper medic and spy all have their own distinct features ranging from invisibility cloaks to the all common 420blazeit sniper the weapons are more or less well balanced in the sense that no weapon is vastly considered to be better than the stock or another weapon although it does suit different fighting styles with new maps almost or at least somewhat consistently introduced you get a different gameplay each time as you encounter players who genuinely help the team players who go in alone and complains no one is there to help or players who are so accurate with their shots and low ping you don t stand a chance unless you lag shot them with your 500 ping you might also join a friendly server where you see players just taunting and conga ing or walking around and killing them earns you a kick or a callout for a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit weaponsmost weapons are attained through item drops which occur as you play so as to encourage playing until the item drop cap for that week is reached strange and festive variants can be obtained by using keys purchased with steam wallet to unlock normal rare and seasonal crates these are however purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay in anyway besides distracting you using the weapons you get you can craft them into another weapon of your liking or even get a chance to craft a more uncommon reskin weapon such as the mauler and sharp dresser some weapons can also be obtained via achievements and in general the weapons are considered sidegrades except for several medic melee weapons all the weapons can be considered to be both better and worse than the stock weapon you are given cosmetics online interactionteam fortress is well known as hat simulator using the weapon drops you get you can craft them into refined metals and eventually recombine them to get a common named as unique in the wiki and normal in game quality hat Tf2 premium dlc is required obtained upon any in game store purchase rarely you may also get hats or even taunts via item drops this purely decorates your character but does most of the gameplay here saw that cool looking unusual guy aim him saw that gibus an achievement hat guy aim him see that guy with ten thousand kills on his strange weapon aim him that dumbass guy who just started playing aim him there s some toxicity in every game so expect that the cosmetics also run all of the trading in Tf2 and it is what allows you to actually earn or lose money in terms of keys and or steam wallet by selling the keys on the market if you are lucky during an unbox you can also get an unusual quality cosmetic or taunt basically a normal cosmetic or taunt with an additional effect and this fetches a very high price in the market due to its highly valued effects market and player dependent you can play the game fine if you do not care for cosmetics and you can simply find some traders or trading sites to exchange for the weapon you want trading is based on own personal experience which is unique to almost everyone and this can not exactly be reviewed online interactions are not rated verdictit s a fine game for playing similar to those less traditional fps that you play i e not the counter strike types other than tryhards who remain tryhards and you can never kill them or beggars or trolls which you can mute or change a server this game offers many playstyles which will definitely suit you at least one way or another"

Super_Meat_Boy,"lem me tell ya somethin this game is stupid no not that stupid this is the qwop of medicine at the moment of this writing it is very short eight levels long with only three different procedures the last two are variations of the iconic heart transplant for someone that isn t adept at using their keyboard and dexterity this game is hard so basically if you aren t prepared to take time to get better at this game don t buy it and don t badmouth it i think i paid full price for this and i am more than happy with it it s hard but not unfairly hard like in Super_Meat_Boy or something like that the game gives you tools and tells you you need to do x now i found doing was the easy part i just had no idea how to do the procedures so overall this game is good for a laugh you feel great once you finish a procedure and it provides a unique control system to master if you re thinking about buying this game go ahead and do so if you re still not sure i think the demo is around online"
Portal,"tl dr at the bottom the mechanics were bad but the gimmick and story were good first the crap parts it s a flash game the game went into low quality mode during boss battles you think my computer needs it the weapons the beam cannon you use to travel can be pretty terrible at times actually everything but the shotgun is for every single weapon excluding the shotgun there was a time i was yelling at the game really many of the puzzles aren t fair due to how the weapons work it could easily be fixed by say removing a set of spikes or telling us the slingshot isn t like the shotgun the glitches bosses would freeze or you could fall off the map of another after a respawn the death mechanics spikes respawn on the last horizontal surface you touched pits respawn on the last horizontal surface fire restart map fall off the map whatever it feels like to make a good game you have one mechanic not two this game learned from meat boy that games with a high potential of death need to have a quick and easy respawn as the respawn wait time doesn t enrage players this also rewards players for doing one difficult jump something like meat boy would make you do it all again however you get to the hard bosses and you find you ve been spoon fed from the mole onwards fire is introduced or at least map restarts you find due to the terrible beam cannon that unless you jumped vertically you were more likely to go straight into the fire and with most of the late bosses i had no idea what to do the boss i hated most was the one of the candyland it had two ramps leading down now that s all fine but the stages never have invisible walls walk too far off the left or right and you fall to your death for that level which involved going up and down ramps at high speed it was likely that using the beam cannon to get you up higher would roll you off the map causing the map to restart this enraged me as the battle went slowly to use the new mechanic it introduced other levels that were unforgiving however were always short that s a plus for me the good bits the story is stupid it had me laughing the personality is great the entire point of the game is great it s fun basically everything else i haven t whinged about well either good or tolerable in perspective tl drthe game is bugged the game is unfair due to bugs and design this game could be fixed with some changes to map design and death mechanics the game handles like a flash game the story is funny the game is original both were enough for me to enjoy it new mechanics were added and were enjoyable play the demo to see if you like it http ww newgrounds com Portal view 558562"

Well_There,"like many a review of this game on the internet this review will just be about praise for this game this game though not without flaws is a shining example amongst indie games and what just a few people can do in a short time firstly the good stuff the game is visually impressive being very colourful flashy yet simple it easily cathces your attention has a superb dubstep soundtrack and it only gets larger the more cd s you get even if it is very limited simple easily understood controls that allow for well simple and difficult gameplay an upgrade system that simultaneously unlocks new abilities and songs for via the aformentioned cd s fun addictive arcade style gamplay that you can just pick up now the bad while the contrls are easily understood the game itself doenst convey how to use the controls very Well_There is no way to check the controls again once you ve started playing the graphics options are limited at best and the resolution options are pretty bad no online rankings as of yet i hear that will be fixed soon though severe lack of modes and different playstyles the game couldve benefitted greatly from having an unlockable charecter or two post game is severly lacking and being so short you need something to rope you players back in again unlockable charecters and finally you cant buy the soundtrack from steam this seems like a minor thing but after playing this for about 3 hours i wanted to support the devs by buying there soundtrack and lo and behold you can t overall the game while a bucket load of fun and value 2 people it has an even greater amount of minor flaws that hold it back from being a perfect arcade e style shoot em up sort of game i have no clue what genre this game is when the kinks are ironed out and an extra charecter is added then i can whole heartedly give this a 9 10 but until then its a 7 10"
The_Community,"despite being 4 year old game i still think that this game is worth playing this game doesn t actually require much skill in fps so it s a relatively simple game for starters except higher difficulties the gameplay is fascinating with the addition of melee weapons in addition go ahead and use mods to enhance your gameplay experience if you think the game is not cool enough visit the steam workshop or l4dmaps com to download and install your favourite mods made by The_Community if you are a new player i suggest playing single player before heading into multiplayer get used to the weapons and campaigns first once you have acquired those skills then head into multiplayer make some friends and enjoy be careful though there are malacious players out there teamkilling and ruining the game on purpose so try to avoid playing with those players anyway i would recommend playing this game if you are a fan of zombie killing or first person shooter games"
Undertale,"alright grabbed the demo of the game liked it and finally bought this one for the full experience Undertale may have a fair share of flaws in which i suck at explaining so i m not going to say anything about em to save my hide but it is unique in its own right now i might spoil you a little bit of backstory or maybe a lot of backstory but i ll try to keep it vague but you play as the eighth and last depending on how you play the game human who fell into the underground portion of a mountain thus the game s namesake you find out what s going on down there and depending on your actions you either save an entire civilization of monsters or doom them along with yourself this game has a fresh take on role playing game experience as it offers options other than outright killing anyone who stands in your way you can choose to attack monsters in a battle or spare them many monsters need to be interacted with before you can let them go and sometimes this can be hard or in between you will meet some important characters along the way and whether they live through or die trying is up to you entirely Undertale s system files remembers your actions throughout the game and if you make the right choices you will be lead to an ending that is satisfying even if it s not for you it certainly is for the characters one wrong step though gives you a pandora s box effect remember the tale of pandora and a box in her possession this game basically applies the rules virtue brings fortune and many will die for the sins of one if you haven t played this game yet this may definitely be worth a try for you that is if rpgs are your thing i don t know about you but i have played this game and it gave me a mind blowing experience so what are you waiting for if this game is your cup of tea grab it it s worth every us dollar or whatever your native country s currency is in my case it s malaysian ringgit"

The_Community,"i have played killing floor for around 2 3 years straight and only now am i getting a little bored of it this creation from the unreal engine is completley satisfying for a survival zombie game although it is not a traditional zombie survival game its is still the funnest if not the best zed based game i have ever played the pure comical action with the witty and slandish british comedy that riddles the game is fantastic and the fps mechanics are just perfect although there are a few glitches in the system when changing weapons and such but this is mainly due to the inferiority of the engine not that actual game and they are quite bearable the visuals are decent not fantasitic or amazing but they will satisfy you for the game itself makes up for that the gore is perfect everyshot fired feels real and satisfying the headshots that you will lay into the zeds are fullfilling and many the variety of zeds are also fullfilling with a total of 10 different types of zeds this is not including the patriarch which is a large overpowered macho boss that you will encounter at the end of each match in which all are completley different from one another in the tradition of zombie survival games the multiplayer capabilities are just great they are solid perfected and polished a total of 6 players can be in a server at a time to which there can be one of each class exempt one there are seven different classes to which are all different in which all can have class specific weapons although the support specialist and the commando seem to be quite similar there are 5 diferent difficulties begginer normal hard suicidal hell on earth to which their titles suggest exactly what they are the first two difficulties are fairly easy to take by yourself if you are a faitrly experienced player but the rest are quite difficult even for a full server of gold ranked players also whichin each class there are six ranks the sixth is gold there is definalty great replayability in this game as to reach gold rank it will take you quite some time personally for me to get to a gold rank demolitionist took me around a year for playing around 4 hours an afternoon and not every afternoon but if you do not want to put in the hours for the reward there are a variety of farming maps in The_Community and ever since steam created the workshop for kf The_Community has grown greatly i give killing floor a 7 10 also kf 2 is coming out soon and looks great you may want to wait for that if this doesnt catch your fancy instantly"

Terraria,"i don t even know why i like Terraria maybe because it tests my house creativity and focusing your mind to the task and keeping it there can be no easy task in it self Terraria is very simular to minecraft its a 2d game not 3d zombies come out at night simular thing occurs in minecraft and so on in Terraria if u get the special requirements sometimes you can face off against a boss of some kind hint here the hardest boss in the game is the wall of flesh which is only found by dropping a voodoo doll into the lava down in hell i wish you good luck and i hope you can make a better house then me"

Tf2,"Tf2 is mixed with lots of differnet things and can give you infinite gameplay you got rocketjumping which is my persononal favourite surf team deathmatch capture the flag and playload thats just a couple of gamemode sections the main idea for some is to kill deathmatch capture the flag ect if you like gore this game is for you if you like capture the flag this game is for you if you like to learn new things such as surfing or rocketjumping that can come in handy during a real match then this game is for you if you like unreal powers and the chance to be invisible then this game is for you if you like a viroty of guns then this game is for you i 110 recomend you get this game the graphics are placed in a way that it makes it feel speical and exciting when someone has no idea where u r what your doing as a spy and as for rocketjumping and surfing something makes it feel so smooth and addictive you just constantly keep practicing and as it turns back you wont even know how good you really are the best you can do is take a look at others so i really do recomend you get this game its got ta be one of the best games in the store"

Terraria,"i ll say that i like robots and that i like the wild west it has both so i can t complain steamworld dig is a great mining game with several influences such as terarria megaman and metroid you play as rusty who has inherited an old mine from his uncle the main objective is to mine collect ores sell them and reach for the bottem of the mine it was originally released on 3ds and the game is quite appealing to the eye they managed to add quite a bit of colour for a mining game which is nice the music is decent but i wouldn t say catchy it more melds right into the game which is great as it adds to the game the mining in the game is all about risk versus reward and it is done quite superbly overall i give it 8 5 10 its fun looks great and you can play the game in your own pace if you re not a big fan of games like minecraft or Terraria you should at least give this a go because for people like me it has a story and an ending plus the game has a bit to offer"

The_Community,"great game on some servers The_Community can be particularly friendly however on some it is all out war building towns bases and forming clans is quite an incredible experience and the feeling of your first gun is incredible buy this game"
The_Community,"the alpha of h1z1 was off to a very rocky start the game was absolutely riddled with bugs rendering it almost unplayable and to make it worse we found out that while soe had said that the only buyable objects would be cosmetic we later found out that this was not the case every person on the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit server with a couple of bucks to spare was calling in an air drop giving them guns tools and food so that they would have a major advantage over the competition but luckily those days are far behind us thanks to one of the best alpha development teams i have ever experienced they listen to what everyone in The_Community says most bugs are fixed within a day of them being reported and the rest they choose to keep working on full bore until they are fixed and i must say thank god they fixed the air drops air drops are now easily able to be seen by whoever is in your corner of the map the range in which they are dropped is far greater meaning that as opposed to you buy an air drop and you get it you are instead having to compete with a barrage of other players for your prize and finally the drop rate of things like guns and other weapons in an air drop has been dramatically reduced so that they won ' t set you to far ahead of the competition this has all helped to turn the game into a far more playable and enjoyable alpha if you want to get an idea of what the game might be like then just picture this day z but made by a far greater team with superior skill and coding knowledge who will in turn choose to listen to what their players ask for and fix every bug that crops up this game is how day z should have been the forest could have been and rust will never be i must put this out there this game is the most fun that i have ever had in an alpha or even a beta for that matter and i am putting that down to the wonderful team of devs behind it the animations though only in alpha are beautiful and fluid there is a smooth transaction between different actions and a polished look to them normally only seen in finished games the graphics while not that bad could definitely use some texture updates before the final release of the game as they are currently looking a few years behind schedule but that is only expected in an alpha and finally i must just put it out there to all you gaming bullet fans that this is currently the most polished and enjoyable alpha on the steam market and thanks to some beautiful optimization it is playable on most average systems but never fear if you are currently strapped for cash but wish you could still play the game it will be free to play to the general public upon final release one thing that i have currently forgotten to mention is the beautiful design of the games ai zombies are as dumb as they should be and not much of a problem alone but are attracted to things such as sound meaning if you fire a gun at the wrong moment you could have a pack of as large as fifty zombies hunting you down at once which can cause quite a problem the way they have designed and built this ai really impressed me they act exactly as you would imagine a zombie should dumb and only a problem in numbers and this ai design has carried over to other creatures found in the game world from skittish deers to ferocious wolves ready to attack anything in their sight and terrifying bears who once locked onto you are probably some of the most dangerous creatures in the game the combat in this game has been beautifully designed the actions are smooth and you are actually able to feel the power as you send a fist flying into a zombie s head as they send a hand back flying towards you the weapons while in most cases rare are very powerful and will give you a huge advantage over the competition while items such as combat knives and machetes will give you the upper hand in close quarters combat a bullet from any of the guns can be absolutely devastating but remember that a gunshot can be heard miles away so be careful not to attract the horde or worse another human hungry for your blood so have i enjoyed h1z1 in the two short weeks this game has been out it has come so very far from the buggy pay to win mess it once was to the beautifully polished and enjoyable alpha it is today i must say that it is hands down the most enjoyable alpha or even beta that i have ever played it has been twenty dollars well spent and all thanks to the amazing team of helpful and responsive devs creating it i would strongly advise any of you zombie or survival fans out there to give this work of art a try and all that i am left to say is that i can honestly not wait for the next big update and eventually the final release of the game soe you have really outdone yourself this time check out more reviews and previews at gamingbullet com"

Nether,"this is an excellent survival horror game as it manages to keep a suspensful atmosphere throughout your experience and manages to create a very realistic post apocalyptic city by uitilizing the use of shrubbery broken building crashed helicopters masses of derelict weather damaged cars as well as of course the players who mostly seem to be very paranoid towards eachother as well as very distrustful this greatly helps to create a tense and frightening atmosphere in which the players survive and one final thing the Nether of course they are not only scary as crap in appearance but they can also teleport and are extremely powerful depending on the variety speaking of which there are many all of these assets greatly help to create a great survival horror experience for the Nether game ps it is still in alpha so there will be a few bugs"
The_Community,"the pay2win level of this game is just it can be played casually and without investing any money in it but then you would be at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that you have weapons that barely match theirs i honestly tried to get to the max level but every time they updated the level cap would just increase and the fact that you rank up too slowly without the exp multiplier that the premium players get just forced me to play this game for hours on end i eventually stopped at rank 100 the max rank is probably 235 by now the game s matchmaking system is purely unbalanced if you re a bronze threat player you basically get treated like dirt and get matched up against goldies and also the backup that you get usually doesn t match the power that the opposition has unless of course you roll with a clan that s filled with 150 ranked silvers and goldies but then again there are some actually decent people that actually have skill in playing this it s just a bit sad that The_Community is just but still i would recommend it with friends and also don t take this game too seriously"

Super_Meat_Boy,"not only is this movie an inspiring documentary about several of the best indie developers out there but it s an hour and a half long journey which you take as a viewer with the people that are in it becoming truly sympathetic for their hardships and joyful for their successes this film is overall engaging and informative and i don t think i can say enough positive feedback to get my point across but i ll try telling the story of the developers of three different indie games braid fez and Super_Meat_Boy during which you watch the production of the game the struggles and the achievments along the way as well as how stepping into such a large project affects their social lives relationships health and day to day routines and really gives you a good idea of how hard indie devs work to produce the games they do the movie is super enjoyable to watch has a great soundtrack and has won a bunch of awards so please just buy it and watch it because you won t regret experiencing what you do while watching this serious"
Evolve,"evoland when asked to sum it up i would say is fairly hard to do it is a great indie game that changes Evolves and develops as you play it starting as a black and white 2d adventure game like the original legend of zelda and developing into a fully coloured 3d free roam adventure rpg more like final fantasy the game is enjoyable short and funny and has a great soundtrack i would definitely recomend this game to lovers of old adventure games and whom want to relive their history and all the changes they have gone through to become what they are today thanks for reading jazza"

Half_Life_2,"okay how should i say this omg it s one of the most exciting zombie video games of all time no more room in hell was a multiplayer based Half_Life_2 mod that was released in 2011 which has been in development nearly 7 years the game has been released on steam in 2013 as a full game and that means steam users don t need Half_Life_2 to play the game the game has two modes an objective based mode and a survival mode the objective based is a simple point to point level which needs players to fight hordes of zombies in their way while they re going to the main objective while the survival mode puts players in a scenario which players have to survive and kill some waves of hungry zombies there are three types of zombies normal flesh eating romero type walker zombies running zombies and children zombies you can also have the ability to play the game in single player mode just go to the create server menu with no other players and just dive in into the game the game s tense and dark atmosphere made the game s very fun and scary to explore especially if you wander alone like a lost explorer most maps are pretty dark so you need flashlight to explore the game s levels you can also use a lighter but it can only lights a bit of an area weapons in this game are pretty badass from pistols to smgs knives to machetes baseball bats to sledgehammers and semi automatic rifles to shotguns the game also have some types of ammo which firearms with a same ammo type can be used however there are still some flaws in this game which sometimes made the experience a little bit boring and annoying one of em is the stiff wooden and unrealistic character animations the lack of body deformation features on zombies the lack of allied bot support on single player mode and the depiction of children zombies there are also no extra game modes other than the objective and survival modes and the fact that the game didn t have some character and weapons customization features still it is one of the most exciting and scariest zombie survival video games of all time i gave nmrih 8 7 10"

The_Community,"this game continues with many of the features that have been entering the game in past few years one of the major changes in this game is that you need to contract with sponsors to maintain your team this being that your team and all other teams change each year possibly even 5times in 5 years this change increases the game play in my opinion other than that The_Community updates and modifications upgrade the game greatly by adding a larger number of teams variants and the like of course there is always the occassional result which is unlikely to happen such as a 55mountain climber winning major mountain stages overall this game series improves each year"
The_Community,"i want to start by saying that i do have fun with this game and some times it s the same way that some people have fun by putting needles into their private parts there is so much that is good about this game and in the same breath i have to also say that there is so much that is broken and needs to be fixed 1 there is no control rebinding that is right a full launch of a game that does not let you edit the controls really 2 the infinate vault hopping thing there are so many vids on youtube and times that i have spent waisting time with a survivor that will just hop through window after window after window 3 perk ballance in relation to the lvl of others in the loby how many times i have come across a high lvl meg with adrenaline seriously that perk is so op it is not funny full heal and run speed 150 at it s best it will full heal from dying state are you serious and after she gets to lvl 30 she can teach it to other survivors on the flip side lets look at a few killer perks insidious for example after standing still for a few seconds you have no terror effect or no heart beat to hear untill you move or act again dearstalker the ability to see aura of dying survivours from a distance awayand iron grasp which makes it tougher for a survivor to escape from you holding them these are in my opinion the best 3 perks that the killers have if you are going to buy this game be sure you have 4 friends to play with as this is currently the best way to get enjoyment out of this game ther is serious potential in this game and i want to see it brought into being and that is why i bought it evolve did something similar before but this game has the ability to offer so much more i just hope that the devs hear what The_Community is saying and make this something special"

Csgo,"basic gameplayyou play as either a counter terrorist or a terrorist both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice you can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you on the terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm important boxes anyway once plant wait you patiently for it to explode as a counter terrorist you must eliminate all the terrorist forces or defuse the bomb thus protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction being a honourable opponent terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the ct s the chance to slaughter the remaining t s and defuse the bomb i ll list some positive negative attributes of this game here positive attributes matchmaking teaches children the harsh reality of gambling although some never seem to learn even after 500 later ranks cool looking skins fast growing population of players fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often chickens high replay value deathmatch game type i could go into more detail on negative parts of it but that would make this review too long and boring negative attributes although i do love the single player campaign it could use some work i really wish it were longer and that final boss fight is pretty lame it only lasts around 27 seconds and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you and how his 7 year old could beat you blindfolded the game mode infernal played on the map de inferno some people like this game mode however i personally dislike it for those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it i ll explain for you it seems like any normal de map however the real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego normally it s hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map and has the ability to shift move around to different locations or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time demolition also known as jokemode added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every april fool s day however some hacker probably that 4 chan guy permanently unlocked it volvo have been working on a fix ever since demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents also no block is enabled and whoa so is team killing the volka strategyyou could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins or you could play the game correctly like me here is my strategy don t buy skins to start with seriously it s a waste of money play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get wait for a steam sale and invest in as many copies of Csgo you can work your way up to about 5 copies or so but make sure you don t get too many otherwise you won t have enough time to harvest all your Csgo account drops having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns note it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have remember to never gamble with opening cases i ve made about 100 with this method i think it s about time to quit my day job in a whole i do love this game and would recommend to anyone good half good half"

Evolve,"dark souls is an action role playing game set in an open environment the game Evolves around the player character who escapes from an asylum and soon learns the prophecy of being selected as the chosen undead who must succeed in undoing the undead curse the game s plot is minimalistic and varies based upon how much the player explores there is little guidance and lack of direction given the player must come to his her intuition as to which path one must take which can ultimately lead to a dead end desired destination or even branching paths this game is not just an ordinary casual rpg it is a survival rpg for hardcore players who seek a challenge as dying is frequent and mini bosses are abundant to add to that monsters deal a lot of damage and players must learn to time their blocks and attacks rather than hack n slashing save points are limited and scattered far from one another the game Evolves around the concept of using deaths to teach players to learn from their mistakes as well as how to react in almost relentlessly hostile environments from experience there has not been many rpgs that has challenged me the way dark souls has i must reiterate this game is extremely difficult the button mapping and camera controls for keyboard is messy if one were to consider buying this game it is a prerequisite to have a gamepad controller or you will be in for a hard time the graphics is not the best but it is made up by the deep gameplay and non stop action overall dark souls is a quality rpg game that challenges players to a new level it is matched with sheer happiness and relief upon progress and completion if adventure is to surprise and mystify you and invite you to uncover the secrets of a forgotten world then dark souls is a great game for you if entertainment is fun without failure and progress without pain you ll have to find another game"

The_Community,"transformice is a platformer in which you join a lobby and cycle through game modes each presenting a new puzzle there were a lot of players in each lobby i joined in my experience the main goal is to climb over each other to get to the door communication is handy in this game but it s difficult to explain what to do in the text chat and players rarely listen anyway overall it s a fun way to kill time if you like platformers and also like seeing a lot of players do random stuff to each other while trying to solve a problem together always had a good laugh from this game 7 10 The_Community 2 10"

Tf2,"kills time got it for the Tf2 hat still had a load of fun"
The_Community,"i haven t gotten all the achievements and there i didn t read each and every entry yet so my full experience has yet to be complete but i can review this with confidence regardless this game is amazing i can not begin to describe how enjoyable i found it from the voice acting to the scenery it s utterly immersive but i ll go through individually to break it down the gameplay this game features a first or third person perspective while you go about solving puzzles for things called sigils this is the core mechanic of the game you must collect these to advance which means you must solve the puzzles and frankly speaking it was very enjoyable i found the puzzles were not overly tricky and most involve some planning ahead but at no point was i dreading going to the next puzzle it never got stale so if you do puzzles then you ll enjoy this game off of that alone however that is not the only thing this game is about the talos principle is a philosophical adventure as well you are continuously guided by a deep voice called elohim and he openly states that he is the maintainer and creator of the world you re in and that you must go along as per his wishes to trancend to heaven this however is met with an issue when you discover another person entity on the computers found in every level named milton or as he is referred to by elohim the serpent as you progress milton will continuously press you with really challenging and thought provoking questions and this is where this game really hooked me i literally found myself battling with flaws in my ways of thinking it s so mind tripping and intense and i love it if you enjoy these things then you will also like the game soundtrack the sounds in this game are really scenic and help solidify the mood of the various worlds it will at times intensify during intermission worlds such as the a b and c buildings and at other times mellow out such as during a few of the puzzles it very effectively immersifies as well by simulating environments such as birds chirping with a waterfall while playing slow deep based music to really get a calm feeling seeping into the player i was thoroughly pleased with the use of sounds in this game especially because you can play at your own place and i found myself just stopping and looking around nice and slowly at times to really enjoy this game scenery asthetics holy hell this game was amazing with its looks granted at times my computer would start buffering because it was on ultra i found that even on high i was just completely immersed and mesmerised by the scenery it features a realatively large closed in map in all the worlds and the look is very convincing to the point where you go to a place where a messenger is and it was just beautiful easily one of my favorite places story i will not be doing any spoilers or anything there are 3 endings i ve done 2 of them with the last one not being done being the easiest to accomplish cough basic completion and i found myself disappointed when it ended yet completely satisfied with the endings this games quarrels between elohim and milton quite apparently mirrors the god vs devil kind of storyline but rather than telling the player who is good or who is bad we are tasked with trusting our instincts and coming to our own conclusions throughout the game as well we see many qr codes which are translated into messages these messages are from other sigil seekers and they show the very different outlooks people may have when faced with such a situation as either scepticism or complacency this game has a simple plot overall of that there is no doubt but it s the characters and interactions with the environment that make this game great i ve left this segment seperate but this is also part of the story you will find audio files these files depict one alexander drennan a person who shares her thoughts on the outlook of the world human beings and our creations she touches on some deep and maybe depressing topics but she does so effectively she very much is in my opinion one of the most immersive and enjoyable aspects of the game the voice actor erin fitzgerald did an amazing job voicing her and we learn the means that built up to the talos principle i will not diverge into it as i think that s part of the enjoyment and what builds a drive to find all the files and information cons there are things in the game called stars they are what they sound like golden stars these things are hidden in almost every level of every hub world 7 3 there are 30 in total 3 are found in the main transistional world where the tower lays these things are heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t i m not even joking had i not looked up a tutorial to find them all i would never have found them you have to do the most heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t things interact multiple puzzles with each other find hidden passages ladders and switches and frankly it s just tedious through the stars you unlock 3 worlds these worlds have 9 sigils in total that are needed for the secret ending i very much dislike how heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing hidden and annoying they are i didn t even know there were so many stars needed until about halfway through honestly a drag you will need a guide for this it s a bit short a game if you re only here for puzzles then you will have such a short playthrough the only reason i have 20 hours on record is due to doing everything with the exception of a few acheivements this by no means stops it from being a great game it really is i would buy this full price just be wary that if you truly want to draw everythign out of the game take it slow otherwise you will probably be disappointed of all of the games i ve enjoyed this game is damn near the top i give it a 9 10 easy i look forward to the dlc when i can afford it edit i ve just completed the dlc road to gehenna it is beautiful in its own way it has the same atmosphere as the vanilla game and obviously still has puzzles and heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t stars but it also touches on a more existenal take seeing many characters trapped in elohim s prison going through all the messages on the boards reading what they have and The_Community they ve built it really does show how society can really becomes this entangled mess i wouldn t say it had the same impact as the vanilla which i believe is due to the lack of voice over erin fitzgerald truley made the game a massive experience for me and it definitely didn t touch much on the same existenal crisis that the vanilla did in my opinion it was by no means disappointing but if i hadn t have been so invested into the story of the vanilla that i got all the endings but the basic then i don t think the dlc at full price i got it during discount would have been worth it in my opinion i think the vanilla is the main meat of it and the dlc wraps it in a nice little bow overall this game is phenomenal and i can not stress that it will forever have a place in my heart and recommendation list"

The_Community,"oh boy this was a tough one i love colossal order and i love cities skylines i love everything they ve done for The_Community taking suggestions interacting etc but i really feel they dropped the ball with this dlc the amount of content you get in this does not in any way justify the price tag who at co thought eternal winters was a good idea why is there no seasonal cycle why does the heating system feel so cheap and tacked on not to mention there s a large amount of problems and bugs in the simulation that they still haven t bothered fixing what do we get in return more cosmetics i feel co has adopted a we ll leave it to the modders attitude you guys want seasons oh i m sure a modder will do that you guys want bug fixes oh i m sure a modder will do that you guys want a realistic simulation a modder will do that and they did check out rush hour i ve supported co from the start but unfortunately if their dlc model continues like this i m boycotting further purchases"
Portal,"whilst at first i intentionally held off from purchasing this game as many of my friends did not have it and the fact that its prior incarnation decided to wipe itself of save files several times i decided to take the plunge into borderlands 2 when two other friends decided to purchase it during a steam sale since then there has been no regret to buying this product the graphics have greatly improved the gameplay is tighter and faster paced and the humour is nearly original Portal level in my opinion with lots of clever quips and references that you have to really see and search for there is one thing however that must be though of when purchasing this make sure you have a friend to play it with because as with any game that requires a bit of grinding a friend goes a long way to seperating boredom from adventures into hilarity a geniunely good game if you do not mind the occasional what the heck moments from enemies"
Tf2,"full of character and humour Tf2 is the sort of game you don t uninstall even if you barely play it simply because its so awesome expect tons of hours of fun it s f2p done right with most items you get coming from drops if your after a specific weapon just trade for it and if you hate all the thingamjigs they added on to it just go to a vanilla server and enjoy yourself you old geezer"

The_Community,"valve is a very generous company to release free professional standard animating software that has created many oppertunies among us The_Community to dive into more than just the game i admit it can be very confusing and almost daunting for new comers of sfm but once you get your head wrapped around the basics you can get straight into the more complex areas it provides people like me borderline broke a source of creative software which isn t a scam or disgustingly cheap thank you valve i reccomend this"

Evolve,"this game is great for a free game it s quite good and we enjoyed its gameplay and its team based offer we have to wait and see how it Evolves but the base concept leads us to think ghost recon online may have a very bright future we deeply encourage you to give it a try especially if you like tactic action"

Css,"i bought this game almost a year ago and i will now show my thoughts and feelings towards this game i never played 1 6 but i played something like 48 hours of Css the beauty of the game is how much more simpler and to the point it is no kill streaks you have to constantly worry about being destroyed by and no perks which can make games very uneven everything is just available to you as soon as you download it the only purchasable items give you no advantage and are simply just cosmetic items which some people will go in great lengths to collect gathering an inventory of up 10k i played the casual game mode for the first 24 hours of the game and then finally hopped in matchmaking where you are given a rank after 10 games you only get matched up with people around the same skill level as you which is great unlike other games where you get destroyed until you manage to gather enough skill to fight back there are some hackers in this game who try to hide that but often they eventually get banned by vac or overwatch which is a thing in the game which gives experienced players the chance to watch games where players think the suspect was hacking to which they then choose a verdict the game is good for veterans and newbies alike as gun play and movement has since been changed since older titles overall the game is a must buy for anyone into competitive first person shooters and the great thing being that i have earned the 15 back just from getting and selling items that randomly dropped in game for me its wonderful 10 10 without some heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit 1 line joke review"
The_Community,"this is my most played game on steam most of The_Community is awesome and it is great to see this game finally getting the attention it deserves there are so many unique game modes to discover adn if you are into the classic sandbox gamemode there is still tons of support as in models maps items being made for it all running on the reliable source engine which is still holding its ground almost 10 years later"

Team_Fortress_2,"team fortress 2 is a very good game with constant updates and content being created and provided by both players and valve teams an incredible amount of weapons is given to players that can also equip a vast array of hats to their loadouts the game has many gamemodes that are both challeging such as mvm mann vs machine a new gamemode that puts up to 6 players in a desperate attempt of defending the objective from an army of robots and entertaining such as payload which consists of one team pushing a bomb through the tracks while the other team must defend the main objective subsequently preventing the bomb from reaching it s final destination all i can say is Team_Fortress_2 is the best f2p experience you ll find in steam"

The_Community,"i never really heard of it and boy i should have my friends reccomended it when we were looking for a co operative shooter to play my god i love this game heres the scenario you ve been stranded on a zombie infested island and your goal is to survive pretty simple at first until you relize everything is very limited your first gun might have 2 bullets in the clip this makes finding melee weapons like axes or sledgehammers very lucky The_Community varies once your with a group of friendly people and the next thing your surrounded by bandits and taken hostage this game looked really simple on the outside but when you play a rough hour of it you will start to notice how immersive the game can feel there will also be scenarios where you have to make a hard decision the game does not script that this will happen in any way possible will you go to the town and look for supplies will you abbandonn your friend to the zombies and make an escape will you eat the moldy corn and risk infection the choice is yours and it can and will impact on what happens after however the game does have some downsides which might not be a big problemthe shadows and details can sometimes screw my pc around esspecialy if you have skype on sometimes the game can break by not spawning items properly like once the only things i could find in a town is moldy corn and clips i restarted the game and everything was fine there were clothes notes bows and everything else you might find in a post apocalyptic town the respawn time does not exsist in this game once you die you can quickly sprint back into the game and hope for something different to happen out of all games i had not found such a zombie survival like this one aside from dayz of course9 5 10"
Tf2,"this is great fun pretty fair also easy on system specs and hasavery smooth frame rate makes me laugh when your running around with your bones showing it is amust have in your catologue and currently i am swithcing between ghostsand this enjoy i am sure you will it does look and feel a little like Tf2 but this one has bettery hit ratings and makes it a but more fare for newer players against established players"

Portal,"not Portal"
Portal,"creepy weird and ominous like a really good book reminds me a little of Portal 2 in the depths below the facility"
Evolve,"having played insurgency many years ago as a source mod back in 2007 i was curious to see if it had Evolved to the point of being a game worth buying in it s own right and i wasn t let down insurgency plays as a cross between the arcadey high action flow of counterstrike and the unforgiving brutality red orchestra 2 you essentially are given varying objectives to accomplish and a modest set of weapon and loadout options to choose from which is handy because if you are bad at fps games you will be using the majority of your time in spectator playing around with it bullets from high powered rifles tend to one hit kill you if they manage to bypass whatever kevlar you have equipped and you will feel very very vulnerable when moving between buildings playing this game is the first time in a while i ve actually been grinning playing an fps for many many years the lethality of the firearms makes moving from point to point tense your decisions matter and your reaction times are crucial notably it doesn t suffer the superfluous unlocking and premium mechanics of the battlefields of the day your killstreaks don t earn you an attack dog airstrike which brings me to my next point everyone everyone is on an even keel and it s all down to how well you play or how badly you play as when you die you will be spectating your comrades playing and teasing the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out of them in group chat or using the spare time to tweak your loadout to better match the pace of the combat i m happy to say that this is well worth the small price buy the four pack give them to your buddies and pretend it s 2002 at a counterstrike lan edit almost forgot it has coop play too 8 10 solid no frills fps action brutal combat tense and frantic gameplay coop reminds me of vietcong 2 good fun source graphics nothing to write home about but who cares do not get this if dying frustrates you"
The_Community,"if you enjoy a shooter with some good old objective based play then give this a try over the years i have played them all but seem to find dirty bomb a breath of fresh air the mercs are fun the loadout system is unique the devs splash damage and publishers nexon are really enthusiastic and supportive of The_Community as well as willing to listen to the players in shaping the game in the end its free its fun and i highly recommend"
The_Community,"state of decay is an open world zombie apocalypse survival simulation made by a smaller studio as such some gameplay ideas are not as well formed as they could be and some bugs persist despite ongoing updates support perhaps the studio s vision is slightly greater than their grasp but the support to date has been great and most major issues have been addressed aside from few niggles of note the simulation aspect means that characters in your group will take the initiative do things for themselves however the ai is probably not quite up to scratch in handling some of the micro associated with this clever macro idea if you just don t like any loss of control at all even when your machine is off then this may annoy you a lot however is is reasonably unobtrusive and does add a degree of simgame like satisfaction if your community is happy and well supplied then it will tick along nicely the inverse is also true and there are endless opportunities for player agency to influence The_Community s state the game answers your questions about how zoey and the team from left 4 dead stay so well fed and where exactly those grenade launchers come from it is engaging well thought out and likely to continue to be tweaked and refined it reminds me of stalker l4d fallout tactics if that helps highly recommended"
Tf2,"i have no idea how to play poker but this game is awesome the best 2 50 i spent at the christmas sales the banter between characters is awesome and the Tf2 unlocks are nice achievement items only not tradable if you play Tf2 get this game especially if you are a heavy fan also recomend this as a my first poker game if you want to learn to play poker by trial and error very nice to play"
Tf2,"this game used to be epic not anymore infact not for a long time now too many little kids and f2p players acting like jerks and swearing over the mic or in the chat box i play video games to meet new friends and have fun and this game is not fun anymore nothing seems to be done about the poor behaviour either as it s has gotten progressivley worse over the last few months especially on official mvm servers making this game f2p has killed it sorry killed it for me if they make an update where the premium players don t have to deal with the f2p riff raff and make age restricted servers i ll come back if not sorry valve you have lost a customer it s not worth the stress and anger and urge anyone who considers playing this game to be wary of the disgusting behaviours by players or avoid this game for a bit i know valve will sort this out eventually as they are a great company please make Tf2 and enjoyable experience again"
Tf2,"i can t play Tf2 becuase of one of the update now any time i want to play Tf2 i get the blue tv of death p s yes i use a tv to play games"
Team_Fortress_2,"an extremely fun game with hints of a call of duty play style and Team_Fortress_2 wackiness the balance of the two styles makes the game unique giving the feel of a competitive game that doesn t take itself seriously i recommend this game to any lovers of first person shooters however this game does come with it s fair share of issues the matchmaking issues are present making it seem as if there aren t any players online as i am in australia i had to change my steam download region to us chicago to have any hopes of playing a seeming lack of dedicated servers seem present as the game most of the time assigns a host for the matches making gameplay very laggy at times this aside gotham city impostors is still a very solid game that needs an equally solid community to keep it alive i still however recommend this game"
Garrys_Mod,"a lot of fun spending endless hours exploring mining and crafting do whatever you want with whoever you want whenever you want the best sandbox game since Garrys_Mod"
Dont_Starve,"tim burton s animation style minecraft s survival mechanics dark souls unforgiving nature Dont_Starve"
Csgo,"even cod comes up with new concepts every few years or so Csgo doesn t feel like a new game it feels like counter strike it hasn t changed much some people may like that but if you are a person that doesn t play 1 game for 10 years then you will probably be underwhelmed verdict if you have never played cs then you can get it if you played previous version of cs you may get bored"
Tf2,"i waited a long time to buy this i played cs for years back when going to a lan cafe and paying by the hour was still a thing then years went by and despite having cs s in my library i never really went back to it i was happy with Tf2 and payday 2 for all my shooter needs then steam sales and whatnot happened and after reading about 50 steam reviews i decided what the heck and bought it 5 hours in and i m very happy i did cs go has planted a bomb at site a my heart i don t know if that metaphor works but yes i was surprised i played a bit of casual before taking a deep breath and jumping into a comp match wow such fun i wasn t flamed for being awful i was playing with people with dozens and hundreds of hours on their cs clock and still managing to be slightly better than completely useless and now with all this Tf2 style unlockable heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit which i am a complete sucker for and a variety of challenged and whatnot this game now has a place on my coverted favourites highly recommend even at full price 15 it s a great deal cheaper than cod or bf and i would argue better in many ways get on it"
Portal,"simply amazing at first you think it s a puzzle maze game akin to Portal but it has the richness of a storyline like myst you gain more knowledge about the world you re in as you progress through the game and you find you re stuck wanting to learn more very addicting i m pretty stupid and even i could work out most puzzles myself"
Half_Life_2,"a very entertaining sandbox game perfect for anyone wanting to mod or create cool things with the half life objects or just heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit around however i highly recommend you get cs s tf2 and maybe the two Half_Life_2 episodes ot get the most out of it since many servers will use stuff from the above especially cs s weapons even if you don t though it s still very fun to play get it nao"

Terraria,"interested in seeing some gameplay see below https youtu be ooqb1ef 84ctl dr cheap but fun roguelike survival game some way to go before it s finished but well worth the price with the current content 7 5 10 review rogue harvest is a roguelike survival game with permadeath and gameplay similar to that of hardcore minecraft or Terraria in rogue harvest you play as the survivor of a plane crash fighting to make sense of and survive in the hostile world in which he s found himself the gameplay is fun and currently semi deep there s several tiers of content for each item from 2 4 depending on the item and you are free to create some awesome looking houses to defend yourself with pros graphically the game is beautiful enemies look super cool build system is intuitive and fun procedurally generated terrain allows for interesting gameplay between playthroughs cons audio can become repetitive procedural generation can screw you in the early game i got killed by a high level monster upon spawning in my first world early access can always be a gamble although this game seems to have a good track record so far conclusion graphics 8 10the graphics for this game are beautiful the enemies are varied and interesting to look at and the buildings look cool when finished audio 7 10the audio is nice at first and matches the game world well but feels repetitive and can get annoying after a while gameplay 7 5 10the gameplay is fun and interesting similar to most games of this genre there could be more tiers of items and hopefully more will be added throughout the early access process i couldn t find much of the story during my playthroughs but i don t last long and i think i accidentally skip a lot of the dialogue overall 7 5 10the game is enjoyable and interesting for the low price of 6 i can t see this ever being a bad purchase there s plenty of content to ingest and the randomly generated worlds keep things interesting"
Tf2,"team fortress 2 aka Tf2 is one of my all time favourites and was the game that brought me into the steam comunity over 5 years ago now bought it before it was free and was definately worth it 3 fantastic game no matter what class or what map your on with all the mods and varrying game modes its never a dull game for me"

Tf2,"Tf2 1 game ever"
Besiege,"Besiege is a great game however it needs more tools such as copying a group of blocks and pasting allow saving as well like functions in cad softwarenew mode that allows solid connection bewtween block for making huge project without inducing too much lag actually solid like the environment so the group of blocks will be viewed as one large block no bendings enable multithreading huge allowing angle block without moddingetc"
Portal,"a great puzzle game that should not be compared with the Portal series there is no similarity between the two besides jump pads that s basically it anyways it s a great game that gets you thinking and rushing to survive and reach the goal 9 10"
Portal,"can not say enough good things about this game if you loved Portal you ll love this it adds a time travel aspect to the normal game of Portal which makes it awesome i loved Portal and Portal 2 and i love this"
Terraria,"after never really getting into minecraft or Terraria i never actually thought i would enjoy this game but i took the dive and let the hype train come over me and boy was this the right decision one of the best games i ve played this year and it is still in beta now that is saying something i haven t felt like such a part of a community since the wow vanilla days but this brings back all those feelings again buy this game in beta you will not regret it"
The_Community,"there is very little not to love about this game the vanilla content is finished to an amazing level of polish the physics are on point in almost every car slides are catchable you can feel the tyre wall flex when you approach the limit you can feel the front end push and the back end skate around more than any sim i ve ever played the ffb in this game is different to any other game on the market right now for the first few hours the wheel felt dead to me because you only recieve the forces that would be translated to the wheel in the actual car not a bunch of canned effects as well with a t500 the ffb is exact and a pleasure to drive with once you get used to it seriously if you don t own this game and you like sims buy this now and there s a laser scanned nordschleife now what s not to love beyond the devs there are truly incredible mods from The_Community i would strongly reccomend the t5 dtm cars from united racing design they re like the best sim cars i ve ever driven and are well worth the price of admission there s millions of other great mods though look on race department and you will find what you desire there are some areas that are lacking in my opinion for example there are no pit stops or longer races the career system is pretty lackluster the ai still does some weird things and the visual damage modeling is not quite up to scratch yet overall though this game is worth every single cent and then some"
Metro_2033,"even better than the fantastic Metro_2033 atmospheric n stuff"
Half_Life_2,"team fortress 2 is a Half_Life_2 engine based fps deathmatch game if your looking for a game to play online and free well this is the game to play if ou just want to play for 5 mins or 5 hours this game is for you with stunning maps and fast responce time your looking to have a good old time"

The_Community,"i ve being playing this game since the beginning i may not have overclocked hours into like others but i ve been here apart of The_Community for a while i have seen the updates and the progress adding new content improving gameplay and twecking features overall i ve been happy but this game is dying the one thing that has cut the last straw is that fact that i have to wait 15 20 minutes to join a game that doesnt last no longer than 60 seconds and i m not over reacting after wasting my time on average a game lasts no longer than 60 seconds cause of this constant long time consumption i have now uninstalled this game as the developers are too worried about releasing new content instead of fixing numerous problems maybe we ll see in the future if they decide to fix it ill re install it again and play again with mates but it s not just me its a large majority who have the same problem"
Portal,"play this the best gamee everr apart from Portal 2 and minecraft play with friends is really fun but laggy sp is pro but boringish"
Portal,"buy this gamee it proo if you like to think and shoot Portals"
Dont_Starve,"great game however would love Dont_Starve together"
Half_Life_2,"this game though it looked worse than Half_Life_2 which was released in 2004 used to be fun and used to have a reasonable business model overtime hundreds of dlc was and still is getting pumped out at slow intervals and at increasingly poor quality the rebalancing of the old weapons system and the introduction of microtransactions was the last straw for me where you now have to pay for decent weapons with real cash whereas before you could do a mighty fine job with the guns that came default with the game not only that you aren t even guaranteed to get a decent gun even if you pay thanks to the gambling system that is designed to milk you out of your hardearned dollar not to mention that some usermade mods were intentionally broken hours of work from people dedicated to this game ruined because of the microtransactions update this game is literally the definition of anti consumer unless you are as rich as donald trump and or are a russian billionaire ganglord you should avoid this game like the plague actually even if you were as rich as them you should still avoid this game consumers arent cashcows like these swedish cucks believe"

Dota_2,"well worth watching it s about a Dota_2 international tournament to win 1 million"
Portal,"amazing game a strong and realistic sequel to the amazing origial Portal i recommend getting both games and if you are new to the Portal series play number 1 first"
Tf2,"fun game engaging sort of a Tf2 meets brink"
Metro_2033,"loving the storyline of Metro_2033 followed by the insanely realistic gameplay definitely worth buying if you love a good thriller"
The_Community,"the way i see this game is you are either going to love it or you are going to hate it it is in early alpha and it is hard to say whether i think it is worth waiting or picking up now i personally find the game pretty fun and entertaining but that is just my competitive side talking The_Community is going to be a rough one lot of games with this kill or be killed mentality often have a horrible community starting out lot of people want to kill you because they are curious what you have and want to take it from you it definitely brings the savages out in the world RIRE i think if you played dayz minecraft and any other survival type game you may like this game very much but if the kill or be killed mentality is not for you then i would not recommend it they have non pvp servers so it may be an option but majority are pvp i really think the game needs a way to encourage people to work together rather than get greedy and become savage bandits but do so in a way that does not affect the players negatively i often like roleplaying with these kind of games but due to the people out for blood it makes the roleplay very difficult or impossible you are just put in a tough decision to kill as self defence"
Evolve,"i don t understand how dayz can fall right on its face when it comes to majority of the features it lacks and mostly how they can charge 30 for an alpha and this game has everything dayz offers plus a tad more and is completely free if you want a good survival game and don t want to pay 30 for dayz or even 20 for rust which are both incomplete alpha early access games then this is what you want i have no problem with early access games if they follow a similar route with this this should once again be a clear example and proof that gameplay is more important than graphics this game is not perfect but it is much more fleshed out than the competition here is some positives and negatives you have skills like crafting shooting survival outdoors stealth that you can increase with exp the map is a good size for now you can craft and build houses with different items some recipes are unique the game offers a challenge if you want basic roleplay and become a bandit and kill other players then you can you can make use of your current groups on steam to build a faction did i mention it is free with optional gold membership multiplayer at the moment is pretty limited i recommend Evolve or hamachi as you can not join servers unless you portforward crafting system is good but a bit confusing at times i have not quite figured it out but i do enjoy the lack of handholding zombies ai could use little improvements overall it is good but may be overpowered to some people melee weapon is required graphics some people might find this a negative i honestly do not even though i think because of simple graphics they are capable to deliver the great features but some might complain it looks like kid s drawing RIRE tutorial doesn t give you alot of gameplay elements you can expect in the game does not discuss most of the features aside from those the game has a great start i don t know if this is being developed by only one person but if so you manage to achieve the basic barebones of what is beginning of a game something i feel lot of these zombie apocalypse survival games are not doing good at they just have basic mechanics"
The_Stomping_Land,"The_Stomping_Land is a very fun and addictive game i would recommend this to all my friends"
Tf2,"Tf2 is a really well balanced fps it has customizable classes which can make for a ton of fun its graphics suit its gameplay style and no class seems underpowered or overpowered 10 10"
Terraria,"the words epic and unique show up on Terraria s store page a total of 0 times would i recommend buying this game yes"
Team_Fortress_2,"simply they stuffed Team_Fortress_2 over they got rid of dedicated severs in which if you live anyway but u s a like me australia your going to have laggy matches because there are bascially no severs in au your going to have to deal with competitive being forced down your throat even in casual bloody casual is now competitive all i want back is dedicated severs and the old search system back as well"
Tf2,"its living off of the Tf2 items but its a fun game in its own right"
The_Culling,"The_Culling really good spent so many hours on it for so few 10 airdrops 10"
Tf2,"so its only in open beta at the moment but its a real solid game right now sort of what Tf2 would be if Tf2 wasnt such a muck around game its hella fast paced movement speed is really high for all classes and you can wall jump and stuff and mostly balanced there are minor balance issues but the game is constantly being updated and as such the game is generally getting more balanced with each patch the company behind this game seems to quite involved with the community as well and is constantly adding and trialling new content which is nice my only really gripe is its pay model like most free to play fps games you have the option of buying sidegrades with both real and in game currency each merc class costs a ludicrous amount of in game currency either 30k or 50k credits where you seldom get 1k per match while i really enjoy grinding for things in game this just seems a tad excessive given there are other things you can spend your credits on it just makes me feel like to get the most out of this game i have to invest actual money into it it s just something that irks me but i totally understand why its in the game and its not a particularly terrible thin considering the game is every bit as playable with 2 mercs as it is with 10 all in all a great fps that is the right combination of competitive and fun"

Portal,"this game is awesome i highly recommend it it has somewhat of a similar feel to Portal it s a first person geometry breaking puzzle game it will mess with your head in a good way and challenge your accustomed ideas about how to play games"
Tf2,"tf2 is a lot of fun for anyone who enjoys fast paced skill based co operative gameplay the game mechanics encourage players to co operate and perform the role of the class they are playing as which means that even with strangers online you can get some interesting team tactics but the best games occur when people communicate microphone strongly recommended the 9 different classes give a good variety of gameplay from the slow but powerful heavy to the sneaky spy this game has also managed to make medic be a lot of fun mainly due to the ubercharge mechanic where the medic can temporarily make himself and another player invulnerable which can significantly affect the course of play there is always new content being added maps weapons the all important hats as well as special events for occasions such as halloween and Tf2s birthday also it s free so you really have no excuse not to try it out"

Half_Life_2,"Half_Life_2 was created by valve in 2004 and still holds up ten years later you play as gordon freeman a scientist with a shotgun and a gravity gun the graphics aren t fantastic by today s standards but you can imagine how great they would have been upon the 2004 release you get control of a diverse range of weapons and vehicles facing countless different enemies from zombies to trigger happy law enforcers set in a dystopian world the game has huge variation in level design and crushing combine soldeirs with a huge metal crate lifted by a magnetised crane never gets old one of the best things however is the awesome physics engine this game has to offer you can use your gravity gun to move objects around you often rewarding you with the satisfaction of firing a metal disc to take a zombie s head off this game can be found on the steam store for cheap and will be well worth your money i say bring on half life 3"
The_Community,"after playing for a few hours i can say this game is well worth the 15 4 character classes loads of quests and elite monsters to kill its like if zenonia and torchlight ii had a baby then raised it into the best game it could be the developer really cares about the game as does The_Community so you can always find someone to play with no matter when you play i rate the game 9 10 would be a 10 10 but i cant make my character cursor green p s if you have any issues check the steam forums there are a couple of known issues which have easy fixes should work fine for 99 of people unless your on win 10"

Half_Life_2,"fantastic physics fantastic mods fantastic gamethis game is seriously the best game ever i own a lot of games that aren t on steam as well if you don t own this game i feel sorry for you11 10 also be sure to get Half_Life_2 episode 2 and counter strike source as some content on the workshop requires these games"
Dota_2,"this game is so fun with friends learning how to play can be so simply this game is evenly matched to league of legends their pretty much the same concept level up your hero and destroy the main heart of the base expect all heroes are unlocked on Dota_2 but in RIRE you have to pay to buy new heroes and skins something that might make people go crazy but i think Dota_2 should be as much the same popular aspects and i just love it when i get a high kill streak making me feel like a god and winning matches with friend i recommed this game for steam users and enjoy 9 10"
Undertale,"alright so this is coming from a guy who doesn t necessarily not like but isn t a fan of traditional rpgs if you re doubting buying this game look how much time i ve sunk into it it s not overly long like other rpgs i got the normal and true endings in a little over 12 hours gameplay and to be quite honest i don t have the heart to do the genocide ending but it ll take a lot longer if you explore every nook and cranny the world now you re probably thinking gee willikers only 12 hours is this pile of poop really worth tenbux my answer is simply hell heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit in yes admittedly it might take a certain type of person to really enjoy this game and if you re not a fan of rpgs this game probably isn t for you but if you re that type of person wow Undertale is definitely a candidate for goty this game will toy with your emotions throw curveballs at you when you least expect it probably frustrate you with a couple of fights and you will love every single moment of it and also probably cry and definitely laugh and even then if you re still doubting buying this video game after reading this and the hundreds and hundreds of other positive reviews like these grab it anyway and if you don t like it get a refund from steam before you hit the 2 hour mark that and there s also a short demo on the official website a very easy way to make sure that 1 hr of good light hearted and feel good unless you don t want it to be entertainment is right for you"

Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive,"Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive this is game is just counter strike with new skins and highly redesigned textures for the most part as for many players the game seems more easier and for some more harder the game is 14 99 and is a good buy if your wanting to start counter strike and i know i know people are going to say get counter strike 1 6 or counter source but depending on your budget and if your into good graphics i guess get this then this game is alright buy jsut skins thats all your getting from it i m giving counter strike go a 7 5 10"

Terraria,"first off let me just mention that i loved Terraria back when it was released a two dimensional minecraft with tons more unique creatures and biomes not to mention unique bosses for different sections of the world now we see this beautiful casual gaming masterpiece we know as starbound much like Terraria but on a much much larger scale it may not have as many pre designed creatures and the procedurally generated ones may not be much to talk about either but when combined with the variation of the different worlds landscapes and scenery procedurally generated or not they fit in very nicely with the worlds around you there are many more block types most of which share a theme with other blocks if put together correctly you could even create a style completely different from that of the rest of the game the bosses are okay in a way they feel like your average boss in Terraria quite tough when you get to it possibly even inspiring during your first time fighting it but once you beat them once it s like riding a bicycle and although the gameplay is solid addictive and most importantly fun i will admit that what really caught my attention when i started playing this game was the character customization whether it be via the character creator cosmetic items found in game or a combination of the two and this leads in to another topic of discussion roleplay i m quite into it and believe me when i say that this game is bursting with potential in terms of roleplay the game has a linear storyline with non linear gameplay allowing the player to complete the game at their own pace or simply choose not to complete the game at all with this in mind the player may choose to complete the game in order to get it out of the way or simply not do anything and stop tracking esther s quests if that furthers their concentration on whatever activities they may be pursuing such as roleplay building a colony exploring or any combination of those now if you ll excuse me i have an appointment to kick big ape s in about half an hour so enjoy the game and its future updates this game is definitely recommended by me and earns my seal of approval which doesn t really mean much and is only meant to emphasise my fondness for this game"

The_Darkness_2,"the darkness released early february 2012 and was a game that didn ' t receive much advertising or player generated hype The_Darkness_2 follows the story jackie estacado a mob boss who inherits a peculiar ability which is wielding the darkness the game uses cell shading similar to borderlands which compliments the game world well the gameplay is quite original and lets you " quad wield " which basically means you can wield a gun in each hand while also controlling your two darkness demon arms the controls feel a bit fiddly when using a mouse and keyboard if you own a controller i would recommend using that instead this game has some of the most gruesome kills i have ever seen in a game using your demonic arms you can rip your enemies in half slice of their head or even pull out an enemy ' s spine from his butt the list goes on the single player campaign took me about 6 hours on my first play through and left me wanting more not because the game was bad but because it was so darn good there is also a co op campaign which was fun to play with friends but got boring very quickly in summary i really enjoyed this game and its unique gameplay but found it was bit to short"
The_Community,"this game saved my long distance rekationship and continues to be regularly plastered across my social networks to the annoyance of friends if you are kinda interested just play it i loved it so much i ve bought at least three times to get my friends on board as well its easy to do when its 3 on sale and you get two copies to give away if you buy it as a gift building your own contraptions is wonderful ludicrous fun and The_Community mods and developer updates mean there is always something new to do this is a labor of love from an experienced developer and it shows the three main modes are puzle solve a puzzle contraption press play and see what others made and create where i make my musical animal themed death traps The_Community is great and always building something new thats cool so there s something for every one the game has also been modded to heck by others if you want to get mega creative within the engine 10 10 would play angry birds with cats again"

Men_Of_War,"the game is very cheap and fun but it doesn t add much in terms of features compared to the original Men_Of_War the skirmish missions are boring and repetitive and the multiplayer is exactly the same wait 30 minutes to get a tigerii except that online multiplayer actually works the main reason to get this game over others is because the multiplayer actually works outside lan and the modding community"
Undertale,"Undertale caught me completely off guard as someone who enjoys a traditional rpg and a story rich game with so much hidden lore and a great soundtrack i thought i d give it a go to be honest i wasnt expecting much this game however is easily one of the greatest games i have ever played and it s truly deserving to be ranked high in the all time greats the charm the humour the puzzles the story the finale oh dear lord the finale i cant stop thinking about it the philosophical nature of the game the various pathways to take the music the fleshed out characters you genuinely care about it s all somehow very beautifully tied together in this 4 6 hour game you ll be replaying this game just like i did and i imagine you ll see gaming and the medium in general in completely different ways 10 10 without a doubt in my mind"

The_Community,"with the recent series of issues like connection errors poorly balanced weapon parts and the game crashing randonmly plaguing loadout it is now clear that the game was nowhere near ready for release and could ve benefitted from a longer and more extensive beta test which would ve allowed for all of the game s features to be fully added and optimised adding onto this the developers could communicate more with The_Community about any critical events like region shutdowns rather than just spontaneously shutting the regions down without informing The_Community and suffer from subsequent backlash all in all avoid this disastrous mess until they re resolved also i couldn t save this as an edit to my previous review"
Team_Fortress_2,"such an amazing game kinda like Team_Fortress_2 except third person and you get to create weapons and characters loads of fun"
Csgo,"shot some people spent life savings on keys for a few cents worth of skins lurked in Csgolounge tried to finish a mission that didn t want to be finished shot some chickens 8 8 like skyrim with guns also if you are good at the game you are a hacker don t fight it"
Evolve,"40 hours into the game i can say this ark survival Evolved is one of the most brutal and unforgiving survival games i ve ever played and i can t get enough the game never holds your hand and walks you through it you are thrust into this deadly world in which you must learn the ropes as fast as you can the game had a few issues on early access relief which is to be expected but the devs have worked tirelessly to fix this and it is a game i would recommend to any fan of the survival game genre"
Dota_2,"vale la pena probarlo pero es muy dificil decir que Dota_2 es mejor que RIRE o visceversa"
Portal,"portal 2 is an amazing game the graphics are excellent for a game released about 1 2 years ago the puzzles are really challenging and it makes your brain think but in a fun way this is a lot better than school and if you are want a game with comedy puzzles and futuristic scenery and design then buy Portal 2"

Terraria,"magicite is an awesome side scrolling game it s sort of like Terraria but not so miney and open world like it is an awesome game with a beatiful sound track and is worth the 10 it would be better if the spawns were different and there were a lot more options but right now it is still seriously cool i cant wait for more updates and new features one of which i hope is a bigger inventory"

The_Community,"its one of my favourite all time games and favourite mmo of all time the superhero storyline and theme is very appealing to my personal preference and the combat hack slash system is amazing for an mmo its simply yet can be sophisticated too if you learn all the powers and fighting combos you can put together your online fighting style and combat technique to destroy all opposing forces a lot of people slam the game for all types of reasons but people need to understand no game is perfect and not every aspect of the game will appeal to you this is one of very very few games where 99 of everything in the game appeals to me and makes me want to delve into the game 24 7 the only downfalls to the game imho is the leveling cap level 30 is very low in my opinion and since i have played since launch i would have hoped that it would have been increased to level 50 at least by now thus adding much more content and storyline to the game the dlcs are ok and some of it was just what i was hoping for but are money grabbing dlcs in other peoples opinions but when you love this game as much as i do i dont mind it at all and will support developers till the end of this games life ive already maxed out and done everything possible in dcuo on the psn network and have recently migrated over to the pc version to start again it shows just how much i love this game and am willing to put in hundreds of dollars again into the game to support developers the powers in the games could be further externded if possible and more tactical battles amongst pve and pvp would be great too im hoping the game will be expanded over time and more content will be added to bring back veteran players and bring in more new players as well for that to happen the f2p system needs to be looked at again as most people have deemed the game as a p2w game it is somewhat but minimal yet its still enough to throw people off the game and slowly kill The_Community i would love to work aside the soe developers to offer suggestions test new content and help expand the dcuo game overall from day one i have had hopes that it would be expanded and content added on a regular basis to rival games like wow to me it has the potential and should have treaded carefully in doing so but now its too late for that but it still has time to make a 360 degrees turn around and still become one of the best mmos out there the metacritic score of 72 100 is very low in my opinion and should have scored much closer to 80 and even 85 90 but i believe that the level 30 cap and slow and small amount of content added over the years had hindered its progress and made The_Community much smaller than it should have been if good content and level cap raised happened earlier on the game would would have been much more known and better ranked its direct rival marvel has a much higher metacritic review score and it is a good game but i still believe what dcuo offers is still is just as good if not better i have had ideas in my mind about dcuo and what could be added to the game to make it much better and bring back its player base and even bring in more players i have emailed the soe about it and gotten no reply and believe its fallen on deaf ears and or the team has given up on dcuo or but it on thr back burner because they believe the potential the game had is long gone when it first became f2p it pulled in 100k new accounts soe should have used that opportunity to build upon the amazing the game they already had and add content accordingly so the new players could see how amazing dcuo really is and what theyve been missing out on but sadly i believe it was all done as a ploy to grab as much money as they can to base future dlc projects upon the amount of players and funds coming into their account thats where i think soe went most wrong instead of listening to the player base and adpting to the f2p system they implemented they went on how much money they could make and didnt take the communities opinions and suggestions seriously or at all in most cases to finish up on my review for now i still think dcuo is an amazing game and definitely recommend to everyone that loves mmos hack slash type of games rpgs dc universe and a mostly friendly community base the game has some flaws and drawbacks but no game is perfect but imho this game comes closest to being a perfect game in my eyes the majority of its content is very appealing to my personal preferences and keeps me very intrigued and wanting to constantly play every free moment i get i have a ton of suggestions ideas and concepts that could would make the game amazing and hugely expansive without much work necessary but whether someone from soe reaches out or even cares enough about its own game to do so i will only have to wait and see i have contacted them twice already in recent times with no reply or acknowledgment at all that they have received my email so i assuming their response team is either lacking in personnel or just cant be bothered i hope dcuo will continue to expand and soe looks to add an expansion pack as rumors were swirling when dcuo was at its peak but since then there has been nothing but mediocre dlc packs good or poor as they may be we need more i would love for an expansion that would raise level cap and introduce a new main storyline to dcuo it would be amazing to see and i could gurantee it will bring back alot of veterans and even bring in new players to the game as they see the development team are still working on the game and actively adding more and better content as it is right now the latest content added are very small and lazy like not much hype or even amazment about them seems like a small team is only left to deal with dcuo and it is very saddening in my eyes and heart i had wished and still do for dcuo to be around for at least another 5 years with active excellent content being added all the possible storylines are already there in the dc comics and just needs to be integrated into dcuo i dont see how hard that can be and how much amazment it would bring to true dc fans and dcuo fans ill give soe a free idea suggestion on a possible future expansion to further dcuo and its content and gameplay take the dcuo universe to the universe literally brainiac came to us lets now take the battle to him and his home giving the opportuinty to even explore the green lanterns galaxy the remains of the planet krypton there is so much more that can be added and expanded from that alone enough to create an expansion that would be mind blowing and amaze the die dc fans and dcuo fans if this were somehow to materialize i would further support dcuo and soe and make sure to do my part in helping spreading the word about the expansion and if given the opportuniy even help out with testing suggestions or anything i can be of help with if soe were to approach and ask me to help i would be a great ambassador for dcuo my love for the game knows no bounds and i just wish for its success to be limitless and never ending please soe heed my word and suggestions and do whats best for us dcuo fans i will forever be grateful and dont want to see dcuo end up a dead community where i am running around with a few people trying the game and leaving not long after because of the dead player base its already saddening to see the same players over and over and no new people or veterans but im sure an expansion and marketing and awarness project would bring dcuo back to life again to the peaks of mmo history and amazement that its destined to be it should be rivaling wow wow has no real rival and i thought dcuo had that potential with its already rich history of lore and stories that are already out there how amazing would it be to play it with your own created hero 9 7 10 almost perfect"

Portal,"this game is a great third person button masher beat em up that includes many different cleaver and satisfying puzzles to advance to different stages these puzzles include the use of jumping gliding explosives grappling hooks slowing time and Portals the first part of the game you will be also doing a few cool arenas with different objectives such as aerial kills and protecting zombies bosses are really fun and have really cool mechanics if you liked raiding it wow i would defiantly recommend thisthere are only a few bad things i can say about this game i found some with lots of crashing and buggy achievements hand ins you may also require a controller as it is a port"
Portal,"this game is very enjoyable for a little sitdown in the afternoon the puzzles are fun and some are a little hard but when you get them you feel good and that is a great feeling it has some bugs and issues the music in this game is amazing 10 10 i saw alot of people hating on the voice actor and i feel bad for him because i actually enjoyed his voice alot the plot twist is amazing and the fast pased intence monents are fun expecially the one where you only have 60 seconds to escape i loved that all in all i really like the game and i admit its not living up to Portal2 but this game is still fun but would be better if you didnt have to purchase it kinda heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit 7 10"

The_Community,"before review notice played about 100 200 hours on the browser before the steam release and am only just now getting round to this review because i havent quite been bothered enough begin review p positive this game is great if only i could end it like that but there is so much more to say the game itself is like if insurgency and battlefield had a child which decided to become free no mum this is my art to begin with The_Community is great at least in australia oceania i ve only encounted a few toxic squeakers and have made it my person mission to eliminate them repeatedly the guns are really fluid and i like the semi realistic take the developers have taken on with most rifles and smg s requiring 2 3 bullets to kill the maps are fun to play and encourage teamwork and make for some great moments with or without friends new guns every month or so negative optional buy in credits of some sort really quite optional as mentioned before pretty much every gun does 2 3 bullet kills snipers obviously less sometimes struggle to actually get into the game keeps saying installing plug in please wait for about 10 minutes but as mentioned before once you get into the game you can easily forgive it well thats pretty much it hope this helped you make a decision in the end though its free its fun and a good time waster 5 7 would spend 20 minutes writing a review for again"
Dota_2,"this is going to be a mixed review however i will recommend it for experienced or veteran moba players if you are starting out in the moba scene this is not really the game for you sorry it s simply just not polished enough for people beginning in the world of moba s i don t have a whole lot of experience with this game so far but i have clocked literal hundreds of hours on RIRE and Dota_2 so i do have moba experience positives personal courier system a really interesting idea that i think works well and helps focus the combat on killing heroes and creeps minions brawlers from now on will be referred to as brawlers and not on looking out for couriers to earn some extra gold recipe system a really cool idea that allows you to change the components that make up a recipe thus giving you different stats but still what the weapon is supposed to do pets another interesting idea that provides a little bonus for your hero and aren t too overpowered or take away from the obverall experience last hit system playing and looking at the demo videos of strife it is obvious that they have purposely designed this moba to minimise toxicity between players not only through community like RIRE but also through core game components and mechanics i feel that this works really well and benefits everyone constant stream of heroes this is both a positive and a negative which will be brought up later not much to be said the more the merrier right waiting for loaders when waiting for other loaders you are placed in the game your hero champion can not move but they can level their chosen skill and purchase items from the shop i like this as it makes waiting for others a little less boringnegatives towers i think every review has covered this towers are horrendously overpowered seriously in league or dota its possible to tower dive for about half a minute or so to secure an enemy kill but in strife the moment you attack and enemy hero under their tower you are targeted this is ok but the towers hit like a truck for the whole game fully levelled people are still scared of those damn things this needs to be fixed asap constant stream of heroes unfortunately the constant stream of heroes is also a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth with a large amount of new heroes the ones already in the game can not be refined fast enough and there are some glaringly obvious heroes champions with op abilities and such penalty for leaving you can t play another game until the one you left is over yup thats it there are probably a whole bunch of things that i ve missed about this game but on the whole i enjoy it as a refreshing take on the moba scene misc things no au servers this obviously only affects au players but a constant ping of 200 300 is kinda annoying no all chat i just can t find it maybe it doesn t exist probably due to the anti toxic community take the team are going for overall to conclude i would say that this game is what it is early access beta its a pretty cool and new take on moba but its still early access and needs some or a lot of work if you enjoy mobas and know your way around them give this one a shot i think you ll like it for what it is if you are new to mobas and are looking for one to start off with give this one a miss until you have more experience simply because i think you ll have a better experience with other moba snow this is all my exerience with the game with a measly 10 hours under my belt thanks for reading guys glitch"
Super_Meat_Boy,"though simple the art style and animations are absolutely beautiful having this helps when youre staring at the same thing for how many hours due to dying so much the soundtrack compliments the game as well and though freaking difficult you still wan na play more and more the controls are simple and not complicated whatsoever with very few buttons you re able to do a range of diferent attacks though i have to admit on multiple occassions i had attempted to say just do a quick punch though what happened was a quick dash ultimately leading to my death whether it be into a pile of spikes or off the ledge it just adds to the difficulty of the game though usually is no problem there a different factors of this game that remind me of Super_Meat_Boy and both games are great got heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit at both but nevertheless theyre still really fun i d recommend this to anyone up for a challenge youre going to die whilst playing this game a lot but no matter how many times you may or how angry you get its all worth it if you re a sucker for platformers definitely pick this up have fun dying"
Tf2,"this game is so much fun with a stupid out look similar to Tf2 runing around in budgie smugglers and your left nut hanging out RIRE running around naked and twerking holy crap if you are intrested before downloading see if you like it watch some game play at http ww youtube com watch v 4wfn49m1k7g"

Terraria,"really good game great game if you are a fan of games like minecraft and Terraria"
Portal,"fantastic game wonderfully designed to match the features of Portal 2 but makes it extremely more difficult while the story is definitely set out well and virgil the new core is a joyful addition to the game this can often be undercut by the difficulty of the game as it will often take vigorous methodical work to even get close to an answer for a course that is something you wouldn t even consider as it goes against the puzzle solving mechanics of the original two games however the voice acting interactions with virgil and the very pleasant old timey feel of the game helps to push you through it and at a total of zero dollars makes for an enjoyable journey through the old Portal universe that you ve been missing for four years i would definitely recommend it for those who ve been waiting for Portal 3 as it may be the closest we ll ever get but maybe not for those with short patience as it is definitely a game of hard thinking the ending is superb it has a beautiful soundtrack virgil is a splendid character to take you on the adventure and in the end the game just feels like a new Portal game it is fantastically well done and fantastically difficult"
Dota_2,"deep and complex fun and rewarding despicable and anger indusing these are the things that Dota_2 is and frankly it wouldn t be better any other way"
Tf2,"great shooter amazing character customization even more so for the guns most character and avatar customization requires premium currency but character items can be found in daily rewards it s got a some great crude humor and beautiful graphics this game is great for any Tf2 veteran or shooter player in general"
Besiege,"it s come to the point where people see the red flag of early access and decide to skip conditioned to do so by a large variety of games that show promise but are eventually abandoned by the developers to rot in a pool of graphical glitches and unfinished stories being one of those people my initial reaction was to pirate this game expecting something brief not worth my time instead i found a thoroughly enjoyable experience that led me to actually buy the game and play through the levels i had so far completed again i ll just say it now i think it s worth buying Besiege for what it currently has to offer a 7 price tag is insanely cheap for a game that i would expect to cost 15 or 20 while currently there are limited levels available there really is an infite amount of time one can spend on them if you simply rush through the game completing each level as fast as possible you ll likely be done in under 2 hours dependant upon your proficiency however you d be doing the game and yourself a great injustice this game is not just about completing simple tasks it s about completing them in the most wacky and roundabout ways you can imagine you ll find yourself restarting levels to try new ideas perhaps to beat your time or minimum amount of blocks used or perhaps just to see if it ll work now that i ve praised the game here s what i don t like about it keeping in mind these will probably all be solved in future updates 1 lack of tutorialswhile the game is relatively simple there are no real tutorials to teach you what to do if you re clever enough you ll be able to figure out how to do basic functions by yourself steering flying etc and the game is all about building testing failing building again however some basic tutorials to point players in the right direction could solve a lot of rage quits 2 no multiplayercome on developers this is the obvious thing to do with the game you add a multiplayer battle arena where you let people fight to the death with their machines perhaps limiting their number of blocks or which blocks can be used maybe you could even add other multiplayer gamemodes like races or castle sieges to me this seems like the obvious direction to take the game in because it ll be awesome and will encourage people to buy rather than pirate 3 the controlsthe controls for moving around the camera seem straightforward yet somehow i always have trouble adjusting to them i m not sure why everything works the way it should but i always end up being far too zoomed out when trying to look at something from underneath 4 the lagthis is likely an inherent issue with the engine and not something easily fixable but i thought it would be worth mentioning i ve got a pretty high end gaming pc but on levels with a lot of enemies and a very large machine i do find the game to lag momentarily when i test my machine keep in mind i ve only encountered this in specific scenarios and only for a few seconds before it settles as you can see these issues are all relatively minor and will likely be fixed in the future even if they weren t i d still recommend this game buy it"
Terraria,"like Terraria but better"
Dota_2,"i absolutely love this game i usually don t like games in this sorta style but Dota_2 is f awesome definately reommend it to all my friends"

Terraria,"this game is simply amazing this sandbox game has attempted to go over an obstacle that most sandbox games suffer from the feeling that you have nothing left to do and let me just say the developers have done this beautifully instead leaving you thinking of what to do next the best thing about this game is that the developers are willing to listen to suggestions from the community something as a game developer you need to take advantage of if you enjoy games like minecraft and Terraria you need to check out this game"

Team_Fortress_2,"team fortress 2 released in 2007 its game based solely on 9 classes which are scout heavy medic spy sniper soldier demoman engineer pyro the core action is between two teams against each other in a battle to capture points move a cart and stealing a briefcase objective of the game is very straightforward its the interplay between the 9 playable characters classes is what makes the game interesting all of the characters classes have different unique weapons that players are able to have an advantage over the opponent the core game has remained constant over the years but there have been notable changes such as new weapons accessories most of this weapons can be unlocked by playing the game while others must be purchased with actual money most of the items that are on the shop can cost less then a dollar to bundles that costs hundreds there are many ways to customize your experience there are many items that the player can buy you can buy hats shirts shoes and other cosmetic gear to dress up in your own special way other weapons can have an impact within the game which you can change to suit your play style in game different classes have different weapons which may or may not be effective in killing certain classes then there is loadouts in all of the classes you can have different combinations of weapons cosmetics and taunts which makes a player unique in my experience Team_Fortress_2 is by far the most fun free to play fps game which has unique weapons and customization that allows the player to run wild with loadouts there are not many free to play fps game that are as good as team fortress 2"

Team_Fortress_2,"the thing about Team_Fortress_2 is that it doesn t feel repetitive after playing for hours and hours there are 9 different classes for you to switch freely on top of that you got different loadouts which in turn gives a different playstyle demoknights for example apart from that this game is undoubtedly not a pay to win game albeit there is some who hates f2p with a passion the only thing you get for spending on Team_Fortress_2 is that you will have extra backpack slots and the ability to trade"

The_Community,"i ve been playing unturned for a short period of time but i have to say that it is looking very promising as i ve only played the free version of the game i m yet to see the features that are available when playing the premium version when you first open the game you re given the opportunity to create a character there are a variety of customisation options available however some of which are only unlocked with the premium version of the game once passed the character customisation stage which can be edited later anyway you can choose between a singleplayer multiplayer and tutorial option being a man that likes to learn for himself i reframed from playing the tutorial but for the sake of reviewing unturned i did the tutorial gives you a basic rundown of the controls movement combat and driving simple but helpful then i decided to jump straight onto singleplayer unturned gives you two options of maps to play on pei which is your basic post apocalyptic map with buildings and towns and arena a difficult map which places you in an arena like area with nothing but the forest around you i decided to play on the pei map first once spawned i realised that you start off with nothing and i literally mean nothing you dont even spawn with clothes on the spawning in unturned is random so i was spawned near a walled off area which i later found was a military base i fought my way through the base and gathered a few supplies including a backpack handgun and suppresor and a map of the whole of pei while in this menu i discovered a skills menu which can be upgraded by earning eperience though killing zombies and a crafting menu which didnt make sense to me so i decided to leave it be judging from the map it seemed that pei was a large scale map that had many places to visit so i decided to visit the local town once i arrived i was greeted by a large horde of zombies i managed to pick off 5 of them with my handgun but i ran out of ammo and had to run for about 5 minutes before running upstairs into a house and dying because i got stuck in the tub this is the point where i decided i was bad at video games and also decided to play on the other ma arena once loaded it spawned me into an arena like area the areanwas surrounded by water ans there were tall rocks around me vaguely resembling stone henge and some supplies however due to the small inventory space i could only carry a small knife and three seed which i planted soon after i decided to venture out into the woods and i quickly got lost my hunger and thirst bars needed tending to so i decided to hunt some animals and quickly realised that the pigs i was chasing were very fast or that my player spent too much time writing a pointless review of a game that nobody will ever read so he gained a substancial amount of weight and decided not to go outside anymore i soon realised that the only way to satisfy these meters was to travel back to the spawn and harvest the seeds i planted earlier but i unsucessfully did so and died trying to find which way i came from then i decided to try out the multiplayer secion of the game but was unable to do so because i have no friends unturned is a great game however i do feel that playing with friends would give you a much different and better experience in contrast to playing by yourself unturned feels like a very basic version of dayz or games similar to this and this is not a bad thing unturned gives you a similar experience to these games but it expresses itself in a much different way this is mainly bue to the blocky artstyle of the game which much resembles games like roblox and minecraft unturned is the type of game that you could let your 7 year old brother play without getting into trouble by your mum for letting him play a violent video game but can still be played by the older demographic just the same to summarise this review i reccomed this game to anyone however get some friends whip up a server and play together and you ll have a much better experience do i see potential in this game yes i do so long as the developers continue to work hard and listen to The_Community and take their ideas on boards as well as their own give unturned a try you wont be let down"

Terraria,"this is more of a first impressions review i have not gotten very far and may or may not edit this review later saying pixal piracy is Terraria but with pirates is nowhere near giving this enough credit this game clearly has complexity far beyond Terraria no a better way to describe it is an adventure micro manage it up with the many abilities crew weapons and ship parts this has potential stuck up the wah freakin zoo not to mention that daunting hunger system that some players may find a tad too hard and the cleaning and repairing and the fishing and the ok i ll stop basically this is a complex game from what i ve seen so far if you aren t ready to micro manage the hell out of stuff you may find yourself being confused and getting yourself into an infinite loop of starving to death like me overall pixal piracy has a lot of potential and if you re fine with buying games that are still in development and are all good with micro managing i highly recommend this as it is a super fun game"
Portal,"had high expectations since playing bastion and this game lived up perfect combination of art music storytelling voice and gameplay putting it up there with the likes of Portal 2 and bastion as near perfect games can not reccomend highly enough this game is worth every cent and an experience you must have"
Tf2,"after playing this game for so long it pains me to write this review however i feel that it is my duty to write this 1st point Tf2 is becoming stale the community is slowly dying as people find it harder and harder to enjoy the game caused from a miriad of reasons reason one the game s deep class based gameplay is somewhat ruined by the people who play eg when you join a server and everyone is playing spy or heavy or whoever the point is that although there is 9 classes most of the time people will all gravitate to one class such as the spy or the engi or if the other team collectivlt becomes the antichrist and stacks pyro reason 2 half of the servers are empty and 3 quarters are trade serversreason 3 Tf2 has basicly become and economy of hats and wepons this is good if you like buying things in the game rather than playing itreason 4 the smissmas update is a beta reason 5 some wepons or classes can be a pain at times 2nd point a game can only last so long and im afraid that Tf2 is on its last legs so enjoy the game while you can rip Tf2 you hold a special place in my heartpre bumber cars 10 10 after smissmas 6 10"

Tf2,"well the game was u good and then they gone and done messed up with this stupid update turning the game into a crappy pay 2 win pay2day not only have they made it possible to boost guns if you buy them they ve turned the entire game into an economy similar to cs go and Tf2 not only does this detract from the game it makes the game less about excellent gameplay team spirited heists and challenging missions and more about some skins wish truthfully look quite crap ordinarily i would recommend this game to anyone and i have on several occasions but now you gone and done messed up devs have gotten far too greedy first with 30 freakin dlc s and now with bloody micro transactions inserted in the game not only have the dlc s progressively gotten worse and made the game less about cohesion and more about we have micro transactions for greedy heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit s can get more cash in their pockets well you can f k right off"
Terraria,"probably the best game on the genre you can build anything you want if you are a builder or you can enjoy cool monster and boss fights if you like the dangerous side of the life yay i ve got over 100 hours of gameplay on Terraria like playing alone editing custom maps and multiplayer co op adventure or pvp this game is awesome with a awesome team working on its mechanics and sprites and the great community that the game have you ll feel like you re at home i give a 10 10 cause it s completely awesome pros boss fights game biomes make it always different npcs every world is different 100 items cons finite worlds don t have a story don t have a local creative mode you have to download a certain mod don t have quests actually there is a new angler npc who asks if you can catch certain type of fish but i mean real quests like the rpg ones"

Undertale,"i don t like ocarina of time anymore anyway do you remember those games that you played that immersed you so much you almost seemed to lose track of real life well saying that about Undertale would be a crude understatement i don t want to spoil this game for any one who hasn t played it but in short Undertale is a rpg that s willing to take everything you know about the genre and challenge it to a godlike level while still remaining a role playing game as you play be wary of the term role playing as you may find that as time goes on your part in the game is more than just a mere role i genuinely love this game and hope it s appreciated for years at the very least because there isn t a single rpg out of 100 s of classics i myself have played like chrono trigger ff7 etc that has handled emotion and character development as well as Undertale p s avoid tumblr posts before you play it if possible"

Half_Life_2,"honestly an extremely heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit game unless you can wait for it to work this game kicks you straight in the balls as soon as you start playing by making it a requirement to buy Half_Life_2 both the first and the two episodes as well as counterstrike to run any map you ll begin to find user made content which is the only thing actually holding this game up albeit barely though majority of the time you re going to have to restart the game to use them if they were downloaded mid game but don t get me wrong they are pretty good what you re going to find with the game itself is that opening a map is going to take anywhere from 2 30 minutes though you the reader don t get technical with me about this i ll cut you may not experience this this game is also prone to multiple crashes while playing this can be anything from a minor annoyance to a complete game boner killer these crashes are not one off occurances though they are actually rather common if you are like well any one else then you ll sit back maybe twiddle your thumbs for a while and wait in complete awe inspiring boredom as nothing happens all in the vein hope that maybe it s different this time it won t crash though just like new vegas the game is going to laugh as you sit there like a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing idiot waiting for some miracle that will make your game work but hey that s just my experience if you still think that buying this game is a good idea go ahead and buy it if not then i am sorry that you had to hear from me how heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit this game is yours sincerely narasha the bane of games"
Evolve,"big alpha review i came into playing the big alpha for Evolve with low expectations i have never played a game thats in alpha before and expected a broken barely playabale piece of trash but i can pleasantly say that the alpha is surprisingly well polished the good stuff the gameplay is exciting i often find myself on my toes always alert for the monster has startled the birds icon i couldn t wait to spring into action with my team mates playing as the monster is just as exciting always on the prowl sniffing out your enemies as you devour the wildlife and become so powerful the hunters become the prey the classes the game provides assault trapper medic and support everyone has their own job and if one falls the hunters may find it difficult to survive the class system makes it important for teamwork to exist within the game making it a very good game to play with friends even on low graphics had to turn it down due to optimization issues more on that later the game looks great enviroments are lush and the dark gloomy time setting makes the games atnosphere that much better the bad stuff i ve read other reviews and forums and it seems that alot of people are having issues with the game even with powerful systems admitedly my system isnt top tier but it s no scrap yard and i was having issues running the game on high to get a smooth enjoyable experience i had to turn the graphics down to low however i didn t expect much less it is in alpha after all the loading times took along time i mean 10 15 minutes long just to get into a bloody level i kept having audio issues gun sounds repeatedly going off when i wasn t firing etc quite irritating the conclusion it s good its very good for an alpha you need to keep that in mind when playing something that isn t a full release the devs have already said they are continuing to add on to this game and have a very clean polished game out in febuary i highly recomend this unfortunately i am writing this on the last day i will ofcourse try to get a couple more hours in so lets hope the full game is as pleasant as this"

Half_Life_2,"i originally had massive problems with running this game and plenty of others did as well in my frustration i wrote a negative review because of its near unplayable state interdimensional studios themselves admited and apologized that consortium s launch was horribly buggy and thankfully this is no longer the case with all their hard work and dedication to the project all bugs game breaking or just weird are now gone i intended on fully editing this review if the problems were solved and now they have i can best describe consortium as a mix of the original star trek and mass effect with the shooting mechanics and engine of Half_Life_2 and if that mix doesn t sound good to you or you didn t like any of these examples then it s hard to recommend however if you re looking for epic 1st person sci fi romp with an emphasis on story dialogue player choice story and wrapped up with some decent shooting mechanics look no further consortium is also the first in a trilogy and only lasts about 10 hours at the most however it never feels too short and i m very excited for what s to come the story is brilliantly written the game has marvelous presentation and the characters throughout the adventure are interesting and their dialogue throughout it is well done combat is a bit like an old school shooter mixed with Half_Life_2 which i find works well enough but it s hardly the focus of the game no the focus of consortium is the interactions between you and the other crew aboard the ship with multiple dialogue choices and the dire consequences for most of them and interdermentional studios have done it brilliantly even with my previous frustration at launch it s obvious how far consortium has come and the master edition truly is worth anyone s time especially for only 20 this is the type of game i ve been wanting ever since mass effect came out and it certainly doesn t disappoint"

The_Community,"now this is my sort of game a game where simply the game is made pretty much by The_Community in most aspects there s no real way to grade it it s made in a fairly outdated engine but still graphics hold up fairly well and the possibilities are infathomable this world is literally yours for the taking or even to make your own world but does not mean it is without guidelines if you strip back the game to it s minimum basics it s dull and boring i imagine the only people who could enjoy playing solo sandbox are 10 year olds who still watch stick figure fights on the internet since this game has no real moderated gameplay or multiplayer besides from the vac anti cheat system the game and your experience with it depend on who you play with and your interest in the game itself i m not giving it a rating that s for you to decide how you feel about it"

Metro_2033,"based on the book by dmitry glukhovsky and i have to say the games is a beast story is pretty good and very interesting following the concept of you destroying the so called dark ones being a post nuclear disaster game you will be killing lots of mutants and encounter communist enemys and even fight the 4th reich the problems with the game are sadly bad pc optimizing and a somewhat weird and not so clear ending that makes you ask alot of questions about what just happened overall i would say Metro_2033 is a really good game if you ignore the optimizing and other little problems and i say it is a game worth buying it is only 9 99EUR also the sequel for this game called metro last light is coming out this year on may 17 for people living in europe and i can t wait for it"
Starbound,"Starbound is amazing and it is only in beta the exploration is one of the main aspects in this game and also throwing you in without knowing anything"

Terraria,"some think that Terraria is the 2d version of minecraft in a way that may be true but the game has a lot more to it than just being 2d there is a lot more adventure in Terraria although the map is limited with the different mobs scattered throughout the biomes it wil be a lot more challenging bosses there are many bosses that you can fight as you become better at playing the bosses also get harder to make it a continuous challenge items items that one of the greatest things about this game there are so many items you can make so many things so many weapons with different attributes and you can choose which ones you want to fight with depending on your preference of combat blocks if you re a builder there s a variety of blocks and the blacks can also change their shape too you can beuild a lot of things anything you want to overall i believe that Terraria is a cool game to play the gaming hours can total over few hundred hours consider checking it out thankschamon lee"
Terraria,"grate game like Terraria but with star 7 3 8 7 also has space ship kablam"
Portal,"as a fan of dc comics this game presents its characters really well espiacially the joker the combat is really free flow smooth and satisfying in every hit the story would not impact you the same way games like Portal or hl series do but it does leave memorable moments it could really be summarized to punch save someone punch win d i wished there was a arena mode or something that can let me punch people indefinitely but the closest you get is the ranked challenges irecommended gameplay is smooth polished and well done recommended 9 10"

Tf2,"what at first seems like a combination of minecraft battlefield and Tf2 ends up being a really really bad game let s start with the classes or better said the class 90 of the players in every server will be the sniper why easy to control fast moderate health long distance attacks and most of the time 1 2 shots kill that being said most of the servers will be about snipers trying to camp outside of the enemy base before the others and after that the next 20 minutes of the game are about snipers spawn camping what else lag lots of in games like cs go i usually get 90 ping but in every server in aos i ll probably get 120 if lucky conclusion don t buy this game unless you have friends to play if that s the case you can get about 3 hours of fun from this game 3 5 10"
Portal,"killing floor is one of the best co op games on steam there i said it it even rivals Portal 2 and day z in my mind for 19 99 it might be a bit overpriced but lower the price to 14 99 or 9 99 and you ve got yourself a great deal 6 player co op in a wave based system was a great idea that sounds a little like call of duty zombies but i assure you this is a completly different expirence most maps are around 9 waves long with a 10th boss wave to finish the game through out the game you can buy guns melee wepons grenades and body armor but on the higher difficulty levels it seems you never have enough cash to buy what you want which means going without that badass shotgun or that samurai sword for yet another round final words if you have some steam friends get the boys or girls together for some great zombie killing"
Team_Fortress_2,"loadout is an amazingly polished and fun little 3rd person shooter this game is comprised of 4v4 battles on small medium maps over a variety of game modes including gamemodes with the likeness of kill confirmed from call of duty domination also call of duty conquest battlefield and also some unique ones to the art style is very cartoony not unlike Team_Fortress_2 also all of the pay to win bulls has been patched removed and now i belive it is one of the most fair f2p games on steam final words fun game may take a little to get into but when you do you ll be hooked"

The_Community,"christ this game this game if there was ever a game that i recommend to people this would be the one think of it as mass effect as combined with game of thrones story is fantastic and is great at hooking you in using its backstory system gameplay is a d d ffvii combination giving it an rpg dice roll feel and it overall is a very polished game however setting up dlc is not an easy task and will have you fiddling around for a while trying to register everything my recommendation get a bioware account and register the game and its dlc before you load it otherwise you will spend four or five hours trying to get it all set up and recognized there are plenty of great guides to fixing bugs and The_Community is rather helpful when it comes to solving issues game 9 10dlc setup 4 10"
Tf2,"Tf2 is probably one of the best games ever invented it combines your usual fps with cartoonish highly customisable characters each of the 9 classes are evenly balanced in such a way that no class is better or worse than another they all have pros and cons that cancel each other out along with weapons which have additional statistics to further add to that class abilities all in all it s a fast paced highly strategic fps that is continuously thouroughly enjoyable 10 10 d"

Evolve,"i think this game is brilliant i have a very cheap joystick subpar cpu graphics and this game runs beautifully and looks really good for an older game the realism is perhaps a little behind something like flight simluator x but the trade off is that this game has military simulation with it which means guns bombs tanks tactics strategy and the 1946 theme and music is so awesomely presented to be honest i only know my stuff when it comes to cessna f 15 f18 high end planes but this is a really nice interactive way for me to see how planes Evolved just make sure when you download this game take off gl graphics i nearly facepalmed this game when graphics were spiking out everywhere and cheap luckily that s just the default you can change it to a better one thankfully forget what its called"

Dota_2,"it is quite a difficult game to initially grasp the store shop and the secret store shops are really quite aan interesting touch that until you get used to the game are quite annoying the concept of donkeys bringing you gear is really nice it enables you to stay in lane longer then most other mobas which is good i didn t particularly enjoy having to buy town scrolls to teleport to my base i d rather press b wait and bam home but i guess it makes Dota_2 stand out my cs game is particularly good in pretty much every moba from league of legends to smite to awesomenauts to super monday night combat and in these games if you don t cs all to well or even don t get kills as long as you don t die it s possible to stay in the game whereas dota gold collecting automatically takes a some time and csing last hitting minions is quite hard but gets you around 50 gold which is really a pain as if you don t cs or get kills you fall behind everyone else most shop items are rather expensive and that is purely based on the knowledge i have from other mobas i would consder myself a pretty good moba player but i don t know what it is about Dota_2 that i find myself not doing as much damage as the other guy as a character that looks like a carry ranged carry it takes some time to get used to and it takes some time a long time to understand each characters ability set and know how to play around it i d give this game 7 10 would recommend"
The_Community,"at the time of writing this review i just finished the game about 30 minutes ago now when i finished it i felt amazing and this game makes you feel amazing both with its story which i won t spoil and gameplay but i finished it in 14 hours which i didn t have that much a problem with exept for the fact that i finished dust an elysian tale the day before in also 14 hours and that was made by 1 person which got me thinking thinking about why there s such a similarity between game completion rate and such a big difference between development however this greatly redeemed itself when at the end of the credits it said that i completed 2 of it s entirety now the gameplay is very good from perfect platforming alliteration to a well made third person shooter this game trully makes you feel like a badass and at times a genius when you finish a puzzle from a tomb the only problem i had with the gameplay was the qtes quick time events which got repetitive at times and made me die too many times another problem i had was The_Community for the multiplayer the problem it didn t exist no one plays multiplayer so i cant really talk about it much to conclude tomb raider is an amazing single player game with the problem of annoying qtes and a non existant multiplayer community i recommend it for the single player not the multiplayer"
Team_Fortress_2,"y es lo mejor para hacer videos de Team_Fortress_2 etc lo recomiendo mucho"
Tf2,"i love the fps mock that is Tf2 it is hours of fun but it takes forever fo me to update"
Evolve,"visually stunning and interesting of course but that can only carry a game so far exploring becomes tedious and dull after a while as the puzzles don t really Evolve much beyond the flipping perspective mechanic and the areas are connected in a confusing mazelike fashion that just left me feeling unsure of where to go and not really motivated to bother methodically searching around maybe this just isn t my sort of game but i can t recommend it"
Portal,"short but oh so sweet Portal is an all time classic that i probably don t even need to bother reviewing at all really immensely satisfying to play look at listen to and be insulted by highly recommend"
Tf2,"ok so firstly if you are here for Tf2 items then do not buy this game the money isnt worth the Tf2 items and when you buy the game it takes forever to get the items secondly if you are looking for fun look somewhere else this game has low graphics and boring characters poker can be played on the internet for free when you are aiming to get Tf2 items in this game you need to play poker for hours and hours and you must win in order to obtain the items in this game you must play poker and beat the other 4 players in order to win there are 5 players in total yourself max strong bad the heavy and tycho in order to win items you must keep playing games until you encounter someone coughing up some gear but you need to defeat that player and if anyone else defeats the player you lose the item the items take forever to encounter and you have a low chance of winning the item it take several hours or maybe even days to obtain them all i have encountered items before but never received them this game is not recommended unless you have fine skills at poker and you are desperate for these items it is an absolute waste of money if you are trying to get the items 4 10chop2014"
The_Community,"this game had so much potential on the day it was created with alot of fanbased projects it really got The_Community going when it was first released and this game had a lot of potential trove is basically world of warcraft and minecraft the concept of mmorpg grinding is still there and there is the block building breaking and making idea implemented in the game as well trove started to become a game loved by The_Community and trion decided to add in more pay to win options in every single update this is very true and trion will probably never change it after you zoom in to about 50 hours of the game a few hundred dollars can change you from early game to late game their ingame purchase benefits are crazy and a few dollars spent makes up for a few days of grinding major in game benefits and boosts such as patron which is like membership costs irl money and increases bonus stats by a crazy amount however trove has tried to conceal the fact that they are money hungry beasts and added in a feature where each day has a different bonuses so free to play players can grind this bonus doubled and increased if you have patron making patron an extremely game changing thing however although pay to win is a major problem free to play players can still thrive if you have hundreds of hours to burn monthly to get to about mid game trion is only asking you to grind your soul out it really isn t much of a big deal note the sarcasm once you get to about mid game you make very little progress daily even if you play a lot tge new level update to make the maximum level from 20 to 30 is so grindy now all the pay to win problems have been covered i can now talk about the gaming bits of the game as i said before this game has the basic concepts of a fun mmorpg with dungeons and raids to do this game doesnt really require much teamwork but farming in big groups would be ideal and easier the hardest raids can be soloed sometimes and there are hardly any boss mechanics a game like world of warcraft or rift has raids and dungeons that requires strategic battle plans such as tanking healing pulling aggro dps kiting timing and positioning although tanking is required in the game and dps is as well it doesnt really feel as exciting as an actual raid or dungeon where you feel like you have contributed to the dps charts a carry can easily be invited into your raid and they can just one hit the bosses extremely quickly after the tutorial of the game there are hardly any more quests to complete which makes it boring becuase all you do in the game is shadow tower raids and dungeons adding in questing would really make the game alot stronger than it is and it really needs to be for a pay to win game adding a questline would put more excitement and make the game more interesting the biggest power rank booster in the game are gems which at a certain point of the game is extremely hard to get in lots of amounts to progress onto the worlds you either sell your soul to the demon or spend 30 trion really needs to rethink about how the game will be updated the amount of hours you will spend grinding on this game will become unbelievable if you want to proceed to the end game stages and levels don t touch this game and want to goto end game in a few months unless you re allowed to drain mum s credit card when i say it like this i m not even joking just play this for fun it s meant to be fun for the first 100 hours"

The_Community,"best mmo yet i have played many many hours into this game and i do not regret one single minute ive spent playing this game but warning The_Community is toxic"
Portal,"honest reviewfirst thing is first i have played path of exile for longer than my hours will show for as i have multiple accounts that have been used forgotten mule etc but steam is my main use of the game roughly 100 hours is more accurate what i can say honestly with path of exile is that it really gives you a feeling of satisfaction when you have built a design of a character put it together over time and it works theorycrafting became a job title and a hobbie spending hours on end simply coming up with a character that would win the game without even the currency to make it happen so what have a done in the game just about every piece of endgame content i am still chasing a deathless uber atziri kill however i have been close on many instances pros endless character builds it comes down to just how what knowledge you have of the game mechanics passive tree to get lost in guild community great game to play solo but with others is just on another level has softcore and hardcore gameplay new leagues constantly released this means a new ladder leaderboard player hideout to showcase your efforts leveling up crafting masters to increase your crafting options over 100 achievements great ways to trade in game and through poe trade 31 05 2016 this is not a diablo clone and it really holds its own as a fresh and original gamecons dying in hc can be frustrating crafting rng can make you feel very unlucky at times main chat can be full of random trash talkers not alwaysoverall so why do i still play there is still soo much i can get out of the game and when you least expect it something crazy might drop item or currency that will change your gameplay and style but the satisfying feeling i get fast clearing high level maps at a chance of gaining loot thats so rare it makes you freak out rush to pop it in your inventory Portal to your hideout and logout and pause yourself for a few moments to think i just found a mirror"

Evolve,"Evolve is a really good game with heaps of graphical features and almost the same feel as if your on earth i really recomend this game if you have the money but its alittle bit expensive for the dlcs"
Portal,"i love this game so many puzzles and the stories are so dark i love it you can only play 3 characters at once and they ve given you 7 so you have to play through three times to get all of the stories my favourite are the ghost twins and the archeologist if you love thinking puzzles like Portal then you ll love this too"

The_Community,"as far as reccomendations go its hard to say because while i personally enjoy a challenge it certainly isnt the most refined game if you buy this game expect bad fps even for typically good pc s i m running 6gb of ram and my overclocked cpu running 4 0mghz and i only run it on simple settings and the occasional glitch in graphics and performance if you can put up with that though its an excellent game the best way to look at it is like minecraft but more realistic at least in vanilla mode personally i haven t tried any of the modded servers or the official servers because the reviews i ve read about the online community disturb me a little so i ve stuck to small servers if i had to give an honest review of this game i d have to put up two reviews once you get past the jumpy fps and occasional glitch the game itself is solid as a rock for the game i d say 9 5 10 just need to iron out the wrinkles as for the second review The_Community while i have heard of bad players the players that i have met online have been really good so although not knowing what other players are like i d give The_Community rating at about a 7 or 8 out of 10 just to try and compensate for my lack of knowledge"

The_Community,"my imo score 10 10why don t have to answer roman s calls anymore because he isn t in the game seriously though here are my points story i haven t played it yet but based on my brother s gameplay it is really well crafted and very unpredictable except for some parts there are also a lot of twists in the story the inclusion of 3 protagonists was also done very good with each of their respective special abilities cheat codes are fun too online i played about 99 of my time in online The_Community as i expected is sos or shoot on sight kind of players so you don t really have a room for making friends the real fun comes when you are playing with your friends the jobs are actually good and make a really stable source of money beware though vehicles are very pricey and it will be a while until you bought your first legitimate vehicle it will still be longer before you bought your first apartment too although they are very expensive they give you a safe haven from the rampaging players that shoot you down with no remorse they also give your owned cars a safe place where other players can t blow them up and you have to call the insurance company to get it back the most expensive ones looks something that only iron man can buy hell the garage already looks like a house heists my favourite part of online they are cooperative missions that need good teamplay and effective communications the succeeding heists after the first one are extremely hard without teamwork but it really feels good once you bring home the bacon it gives you a darn lot of money especially if you are heist leader i got 200k once the problem is that most of the players who joins your heists are 1 noobs who cant do heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit 2 people who don t know what to do 3 people who perform their roles poorly and 4 just incompetent heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit s who sit around heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit while you and possibly others are getting heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit by the police however when someone you know or trust gets together on one crew you can have actually fun and it doesn t even feel that you are competing you also burn through heists quickly and you level up fast optimization hell this console port doesn t even feel like it truly the pc master race has prevailed the graphics looks very beautiful the streets and cities are very lively the effects are truly stunning all this runs on my decent laptop with the following specifications gtx 860m single intel core i7 4710hq 2 5ghz 3 416 gb ram it runs around 40 60 fps on very high settings with no aa and on 1920x1080 there is a little stuttering and screen tearing but it isn t really noticeable and it is just probably my eyes getting damaged from playing gta v constitently well that s all i could say for this review this review will be updated as the game also updates on pc"

Tf2,"hear me out i feel if you ve never played Tf2 you could get used to this game but if you have played Tf2 then you will not enjoy this i noticed alot of servers werent even full and the ones that were are laggy not bad laggy but when your fighting its a huge streak the will just freeze everything i sort of enjoyed this game it is very much like Tf2 but different also if you have played Tf2 your skills will not transfer you will be like the normal bad player in Tf2 over all i give this game for people who havent played Tf2 a 8 10 but for the ones who have a 5 10 i dont recomend buying this game but if you put alot of time and effort you will master team fortress classic"
The_Community,"dayz is probably one of the most played open world zombie games to date it was one of the most successful mods in history and although the standalone isn t looking so crash hot now it s definetely headed in the right direction my advice would be to buy this game right now even if your not really happy with the current build i only say this because the difference between the mod and this game is vastly different and as such the developers are trying to take this in a more realistic direction this won tbe agreeable to everyone of course and sometimes i think they ve taken it too far and retracted from the game s appeal despite what i know they re aiming for i think they have to consider that this is just a game and shouldn t be crafted to a point where The_Community no longer enjoys it nevertheless i d recommend it time and time again as a great away to pass the hours with friends through blood sweat and tears usually in that order"
Tf2,"the only reason this game doesn t have a higher metascore is because it was reviewed when it was first released in flashback articles you ll see prevoulsy scorning critics giving it 10s because it s improved so much maps have been added crates like Tf2 weapon skins so many community contributions map tweaks gameplay upgrades new game mode the list continues this game needs more players all noobs welcome the community can teach you the tools of the trade even if uyou re hopeless d have fun on csgo deffinitely worth anyones time in my case 400 hours of time right now anyway"

Portal,"portal 2 is a fun and interactive game that challenges you to think outside the box obviously it s the sequal to the original Portal so graphics and ui have been increased significantly you play as a test subject for aperture laboratories where they test the potential of beings for the future on the journey you go through many tests set by glados genetic lifeform and disk operating system while observing the environment trying to find a way out of the facility overall it is a great game for anyone looking for a puzzling journey full of surprises"

Tf2,"id have to give Tf2 a 10 10 much much improved to its older brother tfc enjoyable characters gameplay and much much much replay value no wonder ive racked up 600hrs of it"
Tf2,"all i ve got to say about this game is that it is probably one of the funniest first person shooters out there right next to Tf2 well that isnt all i have to say if your looking for a game with almost unlimitless types of guns this is the game for you and with the weapon slots you unlock through the game you can have a sniper rifle rocket launcher pistol and shotgun on you at the same time without making you slow like most other games would plus the fact that some guns when you reload them you throw them away into an enemy and it explodes so to sum it all up great game"

Terraria,"unturned is an entertaining game here give my opinion of the game unturned is a survival game like day z because you re a guy you have to build your house and collect things for their survival and the cities are infected zombies you need food drinks and antibiotics to reduce the detoxification detoxification increases when hit by a zombie the game is fun to play in multiplayer because having friends makes you share your items with others and has to use a lot of cooperation so that all players have things necessary to defend against waves of zombies when i started to survive in the game i thought it would be a game like rust minecraft Terraria etc but i found it different there are many more things to do and what matters most in this game is the way to be able to have enough things to survive from when you start to when you finish the path between the two is as much fun in this game never give up on the game as always will have something to help you succeed the concluion is that it is one of the best games that are survival and is in beta the game is complete when the probability of finding the most entertaining game that was in beta will be higher keep updating unturned having a good life"

The_Community,"not even worth playing anymore it has gone way to pay to win when i first started this it was actually viable i just recently came back and unless you re going to pay loads of then you re not going to get very far most traps monsters and other stuff you can get for your castle for defences are locked and you ll need to either buy the infinite pack or unlock each one using ingame special currency which costs real and having to validate your castle is what annoys me the most since you have use your own hero to validate which means you have to clear your castle without dying if you die then it wont validate you can pay to get The_Community to validate your castle but that also costs because you can only use special ingame currency inorder for The_Community to validate it for you you can ask your clan to validate it for you if you can manage to get in one but almost all clans have requirements so goodluck with that you need around 500 100 crowns for people to acutally accept you into a clan which takes a considerable amount of time and fustration since if you lose in any sort of way you lose crown and quite a lot of crowns depending on where you try to attack and people can plunder your castle so that also means you can still lose crowns even when you re offline or online unless you got loads of cash to throw at this game don t bother"

The_Community,"one of few apocalypse survival games that truly grows from The_Community the dev works on this everyday and is always looking for feedback and opinions on how the game is shaped also constantly putting out strawpolls to The_Community and listens to us unturned is played how you want example if you only want pve you can select your server and if you want a pvp experience with your pve you can select pvp enabled on your server and yes you can host your own servers on your computer it starts out like many other apocalypse survival games you start out with your fists and 4 slots for your inventory you have a lot of places you can wander to when you spawn like a cabin camp small town military base and many more your main mission when you start is to grab a melee some food with drink and a backpack once you ve acquired these necessities you may wish to find a gun if you want to pvp or you may want to collect seeds to start a farm or even start chopping down trees to make yourself a cozy place to spend the night the pvp system is great also server hosts can select if players can bring in loot from their server best for pvp or not be able to bring loot in best for pve immersion their is a leaning system so you can peek corners also you can also shoot out of cars but not from the drivers seat of course load some of your buddies in the trunk of your truck and do a hillbilly drive by if you wish the towns are well structured for pvp also their are lot of cqc battles to be fought and also small hills for sniping but snipers can be easily flanked if you don t post up right base raiding is also important in pvp too people on public servers will build structured bases equipped with sniper pits plenty of windows and escape routes you must observe a player s base and attack it strategically you never know how many players may be in there now time to farm my crops and build my base i recommend you do so also"

Tf2,"i used to think that games used to be about skill and how well you work with a team of freinds strangers all that changed when i got Tf2 hat simulator 2014 i am educated now and know that the things you need to be good at this game are unusual hats worth only 500 a once full now empty life savings account hats hats hatsin this game you will select one of 9 characters which all have their special op power which will make even the most patient monk rage quit this game is about your character going on a pointless perilous journey in order to get all the keys ever made by valve no one knows why you try and complete this story but if you don t your freinds might get more keys than you and you don t want that eventually you spend all your money and or life to buy these over priced hats and boast to some guy on the other side of the world about how cool your 5600 hat is only to have him call you a n00b and show you his 56001 hat and proceed to kick you from the server for being a skrublord in this game you will experience several gamemodes such as kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake a k a tour of duty practice of kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake a k a boot camp show off your sexy hats to people who you deem beneth thyself a k a trade servers school of sniping a k a 2fort custom gamemodes which can somtimes be more fun the the default game a k a custom games every other gamemode with people who you deem free2play a k a every other gamemode with people who you deem free2play the best part of the game apart from the 10 10 hat simulation is when after 10 mins of you being one of the only contributors to your team and right about to win the game with your freinds you get switched for auto ballance ad end up on a loosing streak so fuun and best feature of any game because of this game i have no money no freinds and no life but i have hats and really isn t that what life is all about 10 10 would play again"

Terraria,"por mas intensa o satisfactoria que sea la experiencia de un juego es finita y fugaz siempre estamos en busca del siguiente momento magico no podemos dejar de jugar sin embargo hay ciertas obras que han sido disenadas para ofrecer sistemas que perduran a traves del tiempo - aun despues de que dejamos de jugarlas - y en las que ademas podemos ver una clara relacion entre el esfuerzo invertido contra resultados logrados Terraria 10 10"

Terraria,"wow soo much to say about this game where to start well for starters no matter how many other better games you find on steam skyrim the witcher wild hunt any other game you will never get as much enjoyment out of them as you will Terraria you will never beat the classics such as minecraft no matter how many times you tell yourself you dont like it anymore but tbh Terraria is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing amazing you think the producers of minecraft have it hard of course they do its a 3d game everythings difficult even tho Terraria is a 2d game it has so much more content including bosses weapons biomes enemies items npc s tools ores and a lot more like srrsly you think or minecraft then think of everything is has Terraria has it but about 5 times more especially items Terraria has like 50 times more items then minecraft minecraft just simply cant compete with Terraria you spawn into a randomly generated world with a shortsword pickaxe and an axe you find a tree chop it down make a house make some background walls so enemies cant spawn in there then with the rest of the wood a workbench some tools to mine better ores to make better weapons look at wiki or do it yourself spawn an easy boss and destroy it with the amazing new weapons you have scavenged and made collect its drops to save up copper silver gold platnium coins to buy unique items from npc s such as awesome weapons and humorous items to make your gameplay even more entertaining and just when you think its over a meteor lands you go find its location attempt to mine it without getting killed from burning to death or demolished by meteor heads use the meteor armor weapons and tools to go deeper underground to find and mine some gold once you have the gold you make ingots and gold armor and weapons get better weapons to go aall the way down to the underworld a k a hell RIRE to mine some hellstone make a giant pathway thought the underworld kill a voodo demon and get a guide doll drop it in lava and summon the wall of flesh with multiple attempts to kill it you will then basically have a new game killing the wall of flesh unlocked hardmode harder enemies new bosses destroy the demon altars with the hammer the wall of flesh drops which spawns in new better stronger ores to mine anyway i highly recommend buying this game hours and hours of fun i just this game is amazing please buy this gametell all your friends about this gameget them to buy this gamebuy this game for themwhatever you can you need this game to end your sad little life and make it a good oneanyway take care"

Tf2,"es un juego divertidismo bastante dificil de aprender a jugar no hay mucha gente activa pero normalmente cuando entras en un server al tiempo aparece gente no vengas a creer que sabes jugar solo por Tf2 porque estas muuy lejos de casa muuy lejos hay mucha mas movilidad y muchas formas de moverse bunny hop corriendo normal caminando usando las concussion o cualquier explosion v ademas de las diferencias entre los personajes mucho mas visibles que las del Tf2 lo malo es que no hay vac ni nada por lo que siempre hay gente molesta o solo hackers wallhackers etc la verdad en el poco tiempo que jugue me diverti muchisimo sin contar que se puede jugar con amigos pero solo en servers publicos a veces es bastante estresante para los que se toman en serio los juegos como yo v ya que te matan con granadas que no viste nunca o solo viene un soldier y te vuela todo al carajo pero de vez en cuando aparecen los friendly y se puede pendejear con los objetos y items con el tema del ping a mi me anda bien siempre y eso que tengo una pc dentro de todo familiar solo con lo basico en todo el tiempo que jugue no vi ni una sombra de lag bugs ni nada de eso bueno algun que otro bug con las texturas o los efectos del entorno o de las armas pero eso es divertido de ver si es que no me equivoco y es un mod hecho por la comunidad la verdad debo aplaudir a quienes hicieron tan bien este juego pido perdon por mis faltas de ortografia los tildes acentos como se llamen yo le doy un 8 10 teniendo en cuenta la falta de sistema anti hackers y el hecho de no poder hacer un sv para jugar con amigos"

Portal,"hablar de Portal es hablar de lo grande que puedes llegar con una secuela y la verdad es que creo que tiene un gran impacto en jugabilidad diseno y banda sonora que va de acuerdo con la tematica del juego al agregar un modo cooperativo para dos usuarios a traves de internet o a pantalla dividida en consolas es la incorporacion mas notable y llamativa no obstante esta no debe distraernos del hecho de que hay muchas novedades mas y tambien de enorme importancia la naraccion incluisicion de nuevo personajes y resolucion de puzzles y la hablidad de pensar al tener que pasar una camara de pruebas o completar logros lo cual es bueno ya que no es tanta la variedad de juegos que tengas rompecabezas en el y mas aparte la gran minoria los compra Portal 2 comienza de forma espectacular al inicio descubriremos que nada es lo que parece y que lo que en los instantes de apertura parece ser una aventura en la que caminaremos solos rapidamente recibe un golpe de suerte literal inesperados aliados y viejos conocidos como los enemigos la simpatia del juego se gana debido a que los dialogos que nos dan son doblados al espanol y con toques humoristicos bastante agradables el doblaje del juego es bastante bueno a mi parecer encaja perfectamente con los personajes recuerda buscar objetos ocultos al finalizar las camaras pues puede que sirvan despues para ayudarte a conseguir un logro y con el ya mencionado modo cooperativo tienes un sinfin de diversion con amigos y siendo muy estrategico mediante ello para terminar y dejarme de rodeos un juego que no te puedes perder y es necesaria su compra creeme no te arrepentiras"

Well_There,"half life the game that started it all even though it was made back in 1998 it is still a gem i don t vote games by their graphics but by their gameplay this was an immersing wonderful and addicting experience for me i lived another life in this game the game has everything a gamer asks for immersing gameplay indulging story a nice selection of weapons and graphics that were thrilling in the year it was made but are all old now even now this title holds up till today shining its glory as the first game that valve ever made and a game that changed gaming itself now i will have a look at the main aspects of a good game warning a little bit of spoiling ahead gameplay excellent either you are blasting monsters from an alternate dimension or just trying to pick off those squad men who just don t seem to put you in peace there were a few places where it did get a little bit boring but that was because i couldn t wait until i would experience something new the terrain in the game is nicely made even though it is pretty old due to the date it was made the places you travel through are pretty different you won t be bored of seeing the same old place over and over again the game itself is nicely balanced except that they could have put less ammo in the game so you wouldn t always have a gun loaded 9 10story a nice story is told throughout the game and that is guaranteed to keep you hooked until the last moment of the game even though it doesn t have any cutscenes it tells its story just wonderfully it keeps you in first person mode all of the time so it makes you live the character all the way through the story all the stuff that is happening in the game seems kind of logical as if could happen in real life the characters are well done as well for they act as normal people would act they are as they should be they speak fight help you and do other stuff and there is a wierdly acting character which stands out in the game but i will let you figure that out for yourself there aren t the same scientists all over and over again but we can t say this with security guards the enemies are widely assorted and won t make you think that they are dumb but play as they are real and trying to get you no dull moment will get you in this game so don t be afraid of experiencing any in this game 10 10weapons there is a wide assort of weapons to fit you in this game but do not expect too much there are the main weapons you would except from a game like this and maybe a little bit more due to an monster invasion going on all around you the game has its own signature weapon a crowbar but that is also the only melee weapon that you can use in this game while you progress through the game you will find weapons but there aren t many so every weapon you get you make use of because all of them are unique as i won t spoil much here i will just tell you that there are weapons from the pistol even to such weapons like a rocket launcher and a few of alien techologies are found in the game as well you will find yourself exploring all around you to get some ammo for your favourite weapon because it gives you tons of ammo for a wide selection of weapons and the ammo that you need may not be findable anywhere when you shoot a gun it feels like you shoot a gun meaning that you will find the gun bouncing back in your hand when you shoot it and you can hear the sound for gun firing is well done as well but when shooting a rocket launcher you will not bounce back but if you move while shooting it the rocket will go wrong and hit another spot depending on which way you moved even if you don t have any ammo you get to use a alien techonlogy which has unlimited ammo even though it recharges over time it doesn t take much of it and it has special abilities 8 5 10enemies from the headcrab even to the final boss the enemies are nicely balanced you are slowly introduced to each enemy and its tactics so you know what to use on it and what to do you probably won t find yourself facing a unnormally big army of enemies if you aren t well armed once you learn the tactics the enemies use it is easy to defeat them just keep a look out for them or otherwise you might find yourself in quite a pickle i wouldn t say that the enemies are hard you can use the terrain to your advantage as well luckily one group of your enemies is fighting another so you can use that to your advantage as well if you find the right moment wink but i wouldn t rely on such stuff i would just get myself a nice arsenal of weapons and go defeat that crowd of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit s there are a few weapons which have unlimited ammo and i feel that is unbalanced don t go prancing around as a pony as well you will get your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kicked there are flying enemies crawling enemies walking enemies and big enemies the crawling ones are easy just keep a look out for them so they don t get the jump on you the flying ones need the right weapons like a zoom in crossbow for they fly around and shoot at you and when you get close to them they just fly away the walking ones are easy enough just keep a shotgun on your hand and you will be ok but the big ones need a plan a strategy and a assault of weapons 9 5 10graphics from black mesa labs to even alien fields of doom this game is amazing it now has its own hd models so a few things look better when the models are turned on any computer will be able to get this game running so why not jump in it already and as this game was made in 1998 don t expect modern graphics but that couldn t stop you from playing this game could it the terrain is kind of blocky and the characters as well but if you look past that point get ready to indulge into a game that made gaming as it is today and the graphics aren t that bad everything is quite understandable they have made the graphics the best way they could and i don t blame them because i don t vote a game by its graphics and if you can t stand the graphics there is a source version of the game made by valve as Well_There is a version made by fans as well but i wouldn t recommend that because it is modified a bit but the original is the best in my opinion as it is the completly unmodified version of half life and the best out there of course that is if you look past the graphics there are even little details specified in the originl game but they won t be seen so good and will be kind of blurred but be sure to keep your eyes lit for there are many levers buttons and things like that throughout the game that blend in with the enviroment 8 5 10overall look even though this game is dated it is definently not dead be sure to pick this game up on a sale or even buy it at its full price because this game is worth every cent you pay for it i loved the game it really got me pulled in and the story was just stunning i loved every place i came upon to in this game seeking new adventure and traveling on into the deep unknown this game is filled with interesting moments and is guaranteed to keep you aroused until the very ending this is a great classic and everyone should play it it is an experience not to be missed it changed gaming as it is now and was a hit in gaming and it still is a wonderful game final score 9 10 reviewed by ultrix"

Nether,"i was hoping to really love this game but unfortunatley after playing it for only a short while i have to agree with most of the other reviews the graphics are abysmal actually worse by far than graphics in games 10 years ago to put that in context this year we will celebrate half life 2 s 10th anniversary maybe i just have slow internet thanks abbott but seeing other players move around without even an attempt at leg animation is disconcerting following on the servers are slow as all hell if you do manage in a semi timely fashion to find and log onto a server assuming the slow response time hasn t basically frozen your mouse you will be greeted with some of the worst lag you ve ever seen be forewarned fair traveller you will think it s a one off lag problem verily it is not i have never actually tolerated this much lag in a game and it seems to be a pretty standard part of Nether so there s that this of course makes combat a frantic button mash with little to no skill at first i thought this might be why i can t seem to move smoothly but then i realised that the entire world has been put together so half assedly that physically conected land elements like a floor and a ramp might require you to jump over some imaginary partition holding them together clipping is as you can imagine basically just part of the ambience at this point then there s the game itself it seems to have no idea how games are meant to work there are safezones where you spawn when you die in theory in a safezone you can t use weapons can t die and the Nether can t get in this will periodically cease to be true and you have to run around repairing the anti Nether devices as a noob you will be the only one running around repairing anti Nether devices everyone else can survive without them just fine when you aren t running for your life from aliens which teleport by the way utterly ruining the point of a zombie survival game you re couriering parcels from a to b in the vain hope that you can scrounge enough bits and pieces from these transactions to craft a semi decent weapon none of this is immediatley obvious to you as the game has basically no explanation of anything at all upon undertaking a task outside the safezone you will rapidly become aware of the fact that the difficulty of the Nether around you will in no way be tempered to suit your skill level or armoury leading me on my first run to take on a small Nether army which included a golem try to guess what they re like with nothing by a can gun one shot shotgun made from a spray can and a sword needless to say i died on subsequent attempts i found fewer Nether which was great for me but alas this came at the price of having other players around me it turns out that the average Nether player is cut from the same cloth as a day z player and will galdy follow a n00b out of the safe zone for the explicit purpose of killing them and looting the 10 dollars they have fortunately for them since they tend to already have automatic weapons and heavy body armour this is an enetertaining and low risk sport for those of us trying to figure out the game it is not in short i have yet to find any element in this game which i think is good you find eclectic items throughout the world all of which are terribly rendered and usually look like an entire stash of discrete items much to your chagrin you sort of have to guess which ones can be combined at the weapon smith and into what until then you re lugging around 50kg of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit with no way to use it things pop up on the screen which i m sure are meant to be informative but mean absolutely nothing if you haven t had it explained before and when you start out your chance of survival is approximately 0 since you spawn with nothing but what you could put into a global stash i assume this bit is a bit fuzzy after dying it makes it nigh on impossible to ever advance to any reasonable level statistically any level of enemy can appear anywhere except the reapers and players have trained themselevs to see all non tribe members are walking goody bags pinatas the game has a decent idea behind it and if it were designed by competent designers and hosted on semi decent servers with a reasonable how to guide and some mechanism giving new players are fair shot it d be worth the 15 at this point though i wouldn t even waste the bandwidth on it if it were free"

Evolve,"plague inc Evolved is probably the first game that has made me actually fear for my safety it s also the first game that allows me to destroy humanity with diseases like RIRE and weed which i had named myself for a small laugh while the game is in early access it seems to be mostly done with only a few things missing such as multiplayer and the tutorial but that doesn t stop it from being a good game with what it has the game is in early access and is based off the popular smartphone app with the same name and well yes you could play that for 2 but you wouldn t have as many features achievements there s a ton of them or visuals since the game looks great on pc the app is however a good means as to see how the game works game explanation basicly you select a type of disease all of which work differently you then select a starting country to infect your first victim and as your virus spreads infects kills ect you gain points which you can then spend to gain upgrades which do a viraty of things from allowing it to infect certain animals to making it more resistant to heat or cold which can effect the outcome and reaction of the world greatly your first time playing will probably come as a quick defeat as you learn which upgrades are best at what time in your diseases development and i would love to go into detail about my strategy but this is a review not a guide dso is the game worth the 14 99 price tag in it s current state the answer is probably not unless you re a big fan of the smartphone game or a fan of these types of games the problem with the game in my opinion is that most of the diseases feel the same they do all have differences but most are so small you barely feel a difference between them which can cause the game to get boring fast the zombie and mindworm diseases which are new feel very well done providing a fresh new experence due to their completely different upgrades and playstyle from the rest of the diseases and if other diseases were to follow suit and get a redesign to make them all unique from each other i would be much more willing to recommend this game for its price while i can t fully recommend the game for the price right now i can only hope the game will grow to be worth 14 99 because it is a good game it just needs a little more grabbing power to keep people coming back for more and although i m not quite sure how multiplayer will work it could just be the thing to do it thanks for reading"

Tf2,"guns 2 the second duel for the entirety that i had played feels like guns the duel but with more regulation as a shield trooper i didnt feel clunky at moments i actaully was able to get around faster than the other two female classes silent avengers are a remnant of the original guns the game played as armored core would if they mixed it with Tf2 and warframe the pve is well made in a arcadey beat em up fashion as you kill enemies they drop health and ammo till you progress to the next room level etc shield troopers even with the shield still fell short to the enemies massive count though even with 3 other partners so its not the easiest game to win the cash shop is pretty standard and all the guns have little to no difference in base dps oh and dont pick shield trooper because if you do youll have to pay in game currency for the other characters a solid 81 100"
Nuclear_Throne,"i recieved Nuclear_Throne in a humble monthly bundle and it is by far the game that has recieved the most playtime from the bundle Nuclear_Throne is a rogue lite twin stick shooter with an interesting progression system within your runs your selected mutant will be able to accumulate different mutations after each stage if you have collected enough radiation drops from enemies there is a large variety of guns which i doubt i ve done more than merely scratch the surface of the core gameplay loop is very enjoyable and i will continue to put hours into this gem i do however have a few gripes with the video choices within the game the framerate is capped at 30 i have heard that this is a problem with gamemaker studio not necassarily the devs though apparently when you create a project you have to explicitly choose a framerate for it to run at and later on requires a tonne of work to change perhaps the blame may lie with the devs on that one but frankly it s not a big issue for me becuase of the existing graphical quality of the game and it s not in first person also the game is played in a 4 3 window within a 16 9 interface i think this is an odd design choice but hey it hasn t affected the gameplay for me i would also love a story mode for this game it doesn t have to be 30 hour campign or anything but i think it would enhance the experience for me i will ot however hold this against the devs overall 9 10i would highly recommend this game to any of my friends and the few video oddities are overseeable you are getting great value in this game"

Team_Fortress_2,"this is the perfect game there will always be people online and in my experience they re nice people with 2 being my friends i love the maps servers gamemodes and the seemingly endless amount of achievements the game has an amazing set of characters and actually has awesome lore behind it there s multiple ways to win not only with different gamemodes but by knowing the map finding good sniping positions you must have a good strategy for this game teamwork switching between weapons actually a very good strategy etc or playing a class that you re just plain good at e g i am the best with pyro amoung all the classes i most definetly missed some but these are some of the reasons why Team_Fortress_2 is a perfect game 10 10 highly recommended wait a second team fortress has 12 letters and 9 classes 12 9 3 and 3 is the first number of 3201 if you rearrange those numbers you can make what looks like a half life 3 logo half life 3 confirmed for the year 3201"

The_Community,"like many co op games this is great with friends and terrible with random people i will admit however after playing for a while random peoples is not as bad but playing with friends is still way more fun on the positive side the game engine if very sound excellent graphics its fast paced and fun to play it has multiple difficulty levels ranging from seriously too easy to omg this is too hard so just about eveyrone can enjoy it none of the dlc is required to play the game and if your friend has more dlc s than you easily play with them its pretty slick how you can always play with your friends if everyone owns the base game on the negative side the game can be a bootfest with random people i feel the developer could easiely do quite a bit to make it not so terrible and make it easier to meet like minded players if you re playing with freinds that being i have meet cool people and all but that takes a bit of persistance additionally while the game itself seems to be solid theres an ongoing issue with the developer where the developer stated at multiple times there would never be microtransactions and after pushing out wave after wave of not the best dlc they added a micro tranaction system some people have an issue with this some people feel they made amends and some just do not care additonally the devs seem to lie and manipulate The_Community this game gets regular updates some of the updates are great some of the updates not so much adding missions weapons characters things to the game is great the weapon rebalance the manner in which weapon skins were added adding improvements for people who bought an exclusive dlc thats no longer offered amoung other things were not so great i like the regular updates but i don t like having to drink regularly to be able handle the changes this is a good game so good i ve bought the base game for multiple other people to get them into it i however find it increasingly harder and harder to support the devs and regretable to get people into it also since payday 3 is annouced i ll probably choose not get into that after the mess the devs made in this game"
Tf2,"awesome game completely free to play but you can get a ton of hats if you go premium Tf2 is a pretty balanced game too definitely recommend this game"
Tf2,"es un juego muy divertido lo puedes jugar muchas horas porque su modo de jugabilidad es muy adictivo entretenido y lo mas importante no se vuelve muy repetitivo ademas es un free2play lo que hace que su comunidad de juego sea inmensa lo unico malo es que al ser free2play hay muchas personas y eso genera que algunos servers tengan un gran lag pero eso finalmente no es culpa de Tf2 un juego muy recomendado para la gente que no quiere gastar dinero y tambien para la gente que si quiere gastar dinero porque puede tener articulos que los demas no tienen pero siempre con un equilibrio de ser justo con los dos tipos de jugadores muy recomendado"

Evolve,"risk of rain is a brilliant platformer rouge lite the main thing with this game that pulls me into this game is how easily i can switch from being under powered to over powered and then back again in split seconds mostly from getting too cocky when i have certain power ups p it s genuinely a hard game and i love it for that reason the music is a selling point as well sort of a rocky electronic ambient thing the difficulty scales just right for me it gives me a good 2 5 minutes to do what i need to do in each level so i can do either a quick pick up and play run or i could do a good 40 min run to rarely get to the last level plus this game actually makes me want to collect every single power up and monster log just for the little storys you get alone the only gripe i have with it is how complicated it is to connect with friends when i want to connect with a friend i have to use a program called Evolve evolvehq com that gives me and my friends a temp ip address and even that fails some of the time all in all this is a solid game that rates highly on my games list"

Tf2,"ok so all my friends asked me to review this game but i don t want it be as long as the borderlands 2 review so let s use an ign structure the presentation of this game is amazing the characters art style and music are all amazing to be honest i think this is the 2nd best game valve have ever produced and that is because of the detail all the characters are balanced and holy fun to play as each character is completely different letting you play the game in 9 different ways now about the trading aspect just look at mine and my friend hugobosscat inventory and that should tell you about our opinion on the trading so in a whole Tf2 is one of the best games ever made and it s free"

The_Community,"10 10 probably the best if not the most perfect games on its kind since 199 though The_Community is still the same with you know those constant swearing and yelling when one found out that their teammates cant even play competitives of course alongside other fps community members which is not a new stuff we d encounter for the noobs out there including myself as well though beware as i ve write here you all should learn how to shoot and aim properly in deathmatches and casual matches before going on and honing your skills in competitive if one simply does not learn then prepare for the clutches also look out for chickens damn someone should remake the cs rio map for cs go"

The_Community,"despite its initial detractors j r r tolkien s novel the lord of the rings is revered by many fans and is one of the best selling novels of all time it s an extraordinary story that has spawned three extraordinary movies but managed only a few ordinary videogames until now on the surface middle earth shadow of mordor owes a lot of its gameplay to the inspiration derived from the successful batman arkham and assassin s creed series of games players are given an open world setting within mordor to explore and innumerable orcs and uruk hai to battle and it ' s these battles that set shadow of mordor apart from its influences the combat mechanism is a familiar combination of hit and counter but with an added " last stand " mini game that allows the character to parry a deathblow to remain in the fight winning the mini game and surviving feels truly epic what ' s more mordor introduces a fascinating nemesis system for players to contend with enemy combatants stand to gain promotion and effectively level up from defeating you or from the death of one of their rivals if you flee from combat which is a perfectly valid option when faced against a dozen enemies you will also be taunted should you face the same foes again while not perfect dead orcs should remain dead it can be enthralling especially as more abilities become available outside of the gameplay there ' s also something for the screenshot enthusiasts out there the most recent update has added a photo mode which is quite fun in and of itself with the options available to tweak shots check out The_Community hub for some great examples of the shots being produced from within the game it seems like the gaming industry has turned a corner with respect to licensed products the batman series is exceptional and from what i understand there ' s even an alien game that ' s actually very good and now at long last we ' ve got the one lord of the rings game to rule them all"

Terraria,"if u like hardcore minecraft this is the game for you much more immersive then minecraft in minecraft there is no exploration purposes but in Terraria u can find special statue s gems like diamonds ruby s ect far more ore s and minerals and its actually graduately harder then minecraft the game can either like you or hate u with a wide veriety of monster s and bosses more then minecraft that has only 2 the point here is that even if u like minecraft this game can make it worth your while"
Terraria,"unturned is a really fun game and sometimes even show really i mean really funny moments i recommend trying it unlike Terraria and left for dead 2 it is more like a sandbox game because you can get really creative and build things like Terraria but also go ahead have fun by killing some zombies to be honest unturned is still a early development game which makes is more intresting because we will never know what will happen in the future and what it will be like when fully complete the even better things about this game is that is 2 perspective first person and third person recently unturned just added vr virtural reality which makes it more fun to get in the experience of what a zombie apoclypse fells like and how you can survive in it i strongly recommend this game but i do have a few tips maybe like add a main power place and add more weapons to make the game a bit more relastic such as a ak 47 but the main things i suggest you need to figure out is a story line of how the zombie apoclypse started because the new players wont know how it happend and just get spawned right into the game"

Tf2,"Tf2 is alot of fun and its really good but there is a few errors in the game no singleplayer campaing theres no free for all people hack and cheat and after a while you get sick of playing it for a while so for this i dont reccomend it unless you cheat or hack and want to do the same thing over and over again but there a vac servers witch is good and they stop hackers but i dont think they work but its still a fun game even if you do play with hackers and the acheivments are easy to get unlike othe games ive played so yeah ill rate it 10 10"

Tf2,"aren t you glad team fortress 2 didn t wind up looking like this valve has created quite a game with the long awaited team fortress sequel bearing many similarities to its predecessor though incorporating enough changes to make it feel fresh the most obvious aspect which you may have noticed from any of the screens and video posted is the visual style even after getting sucked into probably too many hours of play in the beta over the past few weeks we re still amazed at the art design both in how it looks and how it animates but let s not get too carried away with the graphics it s a game after all and the most important factor is how it plays and if it s entertaining it s interesting to see both team fortress 2 which has been in development on and off for some seven years now and splash damage s enemy territory quake wars which has seen its own share of setbacks and delays finally come out right around the same time their nearly simultaneous retail release presents and interesting situation for you the consumer as to how to spend your cash you may fondly remember your days in return to castle wolfenstein enemy territory dropping air strikes on hapless attackers and eagerly charging into bunkers to spout forth deadly plumes of flamethrower fuel yet you can t forget your days with team fortress classic or even further back with the original team fortress quake mod with its now painfully dated character models but compelling team focused online play there s really no right answer in this case as to which game is ultimately better it s merely personal preference quake wars is assuredly the more complicated game for those uninitiated in the ways of enemy territory the scope dynamic objectives speed at which the tide of battle can turn and the number of things you need to quickly consider when that happens and user interface can be rather daunting after learning the ins and outs it s clearly an excellent product but it lacks that immediate irresistible appeal so prominent in valve s team fortress 2 and accessibility may very well be the deciding factor in determining which product users prefer regardless it s an excellent time to be a gamer since as tough as it may be to pick one or the other making either choice rewards you with a well designed and highly entertaining title like in team fortress classic tfc team fortress 2 has nine character classes spy pyro soldier heavy medic sniper demoman scout and engineer each class abilities on the battlefield have been streamlined which along with the graphics is what makes team fortress 2 so much more accessible than tfc no longer do you have engineers running around with railguns and emp grenades medics can t infect the other team spies don t have tranquilizer darts and none of the classes have hand grenades in Tf2 each class has roughly three main ways of attacking a primary weapon the heavy s minigun pyro s flamethrower engineer s sentry gun etc and secondary various classes have shotguns others pistols while the demoman has a highly effective mine thrower and melee weapons the scout s bat the medic s bonesaw and so on though classes now possess fewer means of attacking the resulting gameplay feels much more focused each class has a very clearly defined role and the means to ensure they perform successfully the only limiting factor is of course how effectively your team meshes together if your engineers aren t guarding their structures spies can wipe them out in seconds with a few sapper charges if your team is full of heavies and soldiers but lacks medics you re not going to get very far if you re playing a capture point map without any scouts on your team you might as well just leave the server or start berating your squadmates until a few switch classes the medic though seems to be the hinge on which all gameplay balance swivels for Tf2 they ve been given a health hose which blasts out a restorative stream at friendlies within range and sticks to them as

Team_Fortress_2,"aren t you glad Team_Fortress_2 didn t wind up looking like this valve has created quite a game with the long awaited team fortress sequel bearing many similarities to its predecessor though incorporating enough changes to make it feel fresh the most obvious aspect which you may have noticed from any of the screens and video posted is the visual style even after getting sucked into probably too many hours of play in the beta over the past few weeks we re still amazed at the art design both in how it looks and how it animates but let s not get too carried away with the graphics it s a game after all and the most important factor is how it plays and if it s entertaining it s interesting to see both Team_Fortress_2 which has been in development on and off for some seven years now and splash damage s enemy territory quake wars which has seen its own share of setbacks and delays finally come out right around the same time their nearly simultaneous retail release presents and interesting situation for you the consumer as to how to spend your cash you may fondly remember your days in return to castle wolfenstein enemy territory dropping air strikes on hapless attackers and eagerly charging into bunkers to spout forth deadly plumes of flamethrower fuel yet you can t forget your days with team fortress classic or even further back with the original team fortress quake mod with its now painfully dated character models but compelling team focused online play there s really no right answer in this case as to which game is ultimately better it s merely personal preference quake wars is assuredly the more complicated game for those uninitiated in the ways of enemy territory the scope dynamic objectives speed at which the tide of battle can turn and the number of things you need to quickly consider when that happens and user interface can be rather daunting after learning the ins and outs it s clearly an excellent product but it lacks that immediate irresistible appeal so prominent in valve s Team_Fortress_2 and accessibility may very well be the deciding factor in determining which product users prefer regardless it s an excellent time to be a gamer since as tough as it may be to pick one or the other making either choice rewards you with a well designed and highly entertaining title like in team fortress classic tfc Team_Fortress_2 has nine character classes spy pyro soldier heavy medic sniper demoman scout and engineer each class abilities on the battlefield have been streamlined which along with the graphics is what makes Team_Fortress_2 so much more accessible than tfc no longer do you have engineers running around with railguns and emp grenades medics can t infect the other team spies don t have tranquilizer darts and none of the classes have hand grenades in Tf2 each class has roughly three main ways of attacking a primary weapon the heavy s minigun pyro s flamethrower engineer s sentry gun etc and secondary various classes have shotguns others pistols while the demoman has a highly effective mine thrower and melee weapons the scout s bat the medic s bonesaw and so on though classes now possess fewer means of attacking the resulting gameplay feels much more focused each class has a very clearly defined role and the means to ensure they perform successfully the only limiting factor is of course how effectively your team meshes together if your engineers aren t guarding their structures spies can wipe them out in seconds with a few sapper charges if your team is full of heavies and soldiers but lacks medics you re not going to get very far if you re playing a capture point map without any scouts on your team you might as well just leave the server or start berating your squadmates until a few switch classes the medic though seems to be the hinge on which all gameplay balance swivels for Tf2 they ve been given a health hose which blasts out a restorative stream at friendlies within range and sticks to them as

Tf2,"strictly speaking Tf2 the usual multiplayer thriller division on the role that is different from competitors only at the expense of humor of course if shooting at the men in funny red and blue costumes everything you do not have enough to be happy and do not need more"
Terraria,"an old man awaits at the entrance of a dungeon stricken by a mysterious curse he urges you to return after the sun has set to free him of the madness that has infected his body so you spend the day amid the grassy splendor of Terraria surveying caves slaying rabbits and slimes as the hours tick by once night has set you return to the old man to free him of his curse and reap whatever rewards he wishes to give you it turns out that the little curse transformed the old man into a demonic skeleton a hovering monstrosity that unleashes holy hell upon your poorly equipped explorer the battle rages for 10 seconds maybe 20 if you run away at the onset and then you re left staring at your corpse and wondering how you could ever defeat such a beast but there s no reason to be deterred by such a thorough beating Terraria uses an empowering sense of discovery to grab you and that unrestrained freedom is a double edged sword free to explore the untouched lands you may happen upon a monster much more powerful than you or you may find a chest filled with precious treasures you re never sure where your travels will lead you but your curiosity is always rewarded you may gain knowledge such as knowing not to talk to old men at night or happen upon a cache of gold which can be used to forge a powerful sword it s a world bursting with possibilities Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await an apartment complex reaching toward the sky gives your helpers plenty of room for themselves Terraria debuted on the pc almost two years ago and i was worried how such a mouse heavy game could make the transition to a traditional control scheme after a little practice my worries were thankfully banished movement works remarkably well on the vita which makes sense given that Terraria feels like a 2d platformer performing precise jumps and grappling up walls feel even better using an analog stick instead of keyboard keys so there s joy in traversing the world that didn t exist before however movement isn t nearly as important as excavation and that s where patience matters no longer can you dig precisely with a mouse instead you use a stick the game has two options manual and smart which have different strengths and weaknesses if you re clearing a deep hole smart is blunt and effective if you need to focus on individual blocks manual works fine unfortunately your cursor is controlled by both the right stick and the back touchpad and there s no way to disable the second scheme so you do have to hold the vita carefully lest you dig haphazardly Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await discovery is the essence of Terraria but thankfully that doesn t extend to basic play concepts the pc version struggled to communicate exactly what you were supposed to do in this expansive world and though the vita version doesn t spell out every detail it does a great job of pushing you in the right direction shelter is the most pressing matter for a lone explorer chop down trees to gain wood and then use that wood to build a house once you lay out the frame you need doors and a chair to complete the requirements and that s where you get your first hint at what makes Terraria so appealing you re told to make a crafting table and by standing near it you can make the rest of the pieces to finish your house and there are a lot more items you can craft beyond that with a bevy of weapons and armor clothes and decorations there are tons of tools you can make that help you become a better explorer a little snow never hurt anyone the items you can craft are clearly spelled out for you so you re never unclear about what s possible once you acquire any of the plentiful materials strewn about the land you learn how you can use them to craft something that could help you on the journey turn cobwebs into silk and then combine that with wood to make a bed melt silver nuggets into bars and then pound those into a shining suit at your anvil by seeing exactly what items you can create you re pushed to gather those materials as quickly as you can you want that jungle hat right well you better find an underground jungle and gather spores if you want to sport that fine protective gear an enticing cycle of hunting for materials followed by reaping a reward crops up in the early moments once you have golden armor and tools you can venture further which allows you to access even more powerful weapons much of your time in Terraria is spent digging elaborate tunnels beneath the surface it s there that the most precious resources are buried so you grab some torches and try to fend off the skeletons and bats as you dig ever deeper down it s a slow process that stays compelling for two important reasons first with so many secrets hidden below you continually stumble upon exciting new areas maybe you land at a place filled with bioluminescent mushrooms that can be brewed into a handy potion or find a makeshift house hiding a treasure chest you never know so you keep digging second there s a puzzle element to digging successfully when you chip away at rock in the deep end of a lake you have to figure out how to manage your dwindling supply of oxygen while going further down or you may have to divert water toward smoldering lava to create obsidian you re always planning the best possible route while fending off enemies which keeps you engaged during those solitary hours carving out earth it would be so much easier to mine this meteor if aliens weren t flying at your head once you harvest enough gold to drape yourself in it you may wonder where you re supposed to go next well thankfully there s a guide who can point you in the right direction building houses attracts non player characters and each has his or her own way to help you the guide tells you that it s finally time to fight a boss and even details how to summon it which is a godsend if you re lost if you have an explosive in your inventory a blast happy dude moves in who happily sells you dynamite and bombs there s no way to know exactly what will lure more npcs to your commune so just experiment with everything possible none of them are necessary to complete your adventure but they are a handy resource when you re stumped just make sure you fortify your walls you wouldn t want a goblin army killing your only friends combat in Terraria is often simple killing slimes is more about positioning than deeper tactics so most enemies serve as a distraction rather than a serious roadblock of course you could play with permadeath if you want a real challenge or lose all of your items upon every death but such consequences were so severe for me that i didn t want to venture forth which defeats the point of the game the normal option is that you lose money when you die which is a gentle scolding more than a serious setback digging a helevator is the quickest way to reach the bottom of the world be prepared to die a lot when bosses make an appearance every battle is against a massive beast that dwarfs your feeble adventurer so you have to be smart and well prepared if you re going to come out on top if you collect enough shooting stars beforehand you can craft mana crystals that let you use magic it s much safer to shoot magical strikes from a distance than to get up close with your warhammer still there are many different tactics to take out the various bosses and who knows maybe you won t have a chance to plan out a strategy at all the eye of cthulhu randomly appears once you ve become powerful enough and it s crazy to fight this flying beast while in a subterranean jungle always be prepared for a fight you wouldn t want to lose your hard earned money because you forgot your bow"
The_Community,"great game but The_Community is so terrible"
The_Community,"The_Community in this game is terrible today i played a competitive game on inferno and i ran into some very rude people i simply wanted to hunt down all the chickens in the map i was wandering around when suddenly i was shot at by a very rude person someone on my team then proceded to yell at me for not shooting him volvo however puts excellent updates into the game for instance increased max chicken population from 10 to 12 in a recent update of which many people are calling the best update ever this is a good step in the right direction for volvo as increasing the max chicken population will ensure that players are never tired of completing the game best parts of the game chickens best chicken killing simulator ever polar bear dreamhack stickers check out my p90 and p250 chickens moar chickensissues that must be adressed some maps don t have any chickens in a 10 man competitive match there aren t enough chickens for everyone chickens should not have teleport hax chickens need more hp chickens there is currently no way to cook the chickens new players may find killing chickens difficult steep learning curve chickens chickens do not do enough damage too many players in a map distract you from the real game same thing goes for trees and crap10 10 chicken simulator"
