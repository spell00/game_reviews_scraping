i noscoped some dude in at Tree 11 10 gamespot
email confirmation is horrible havent played yet 10 10 gamespot would email again but stuck in dimension of Ingmar and tasers
think of this call of Duty plus a Tour of jokers Funhouse i love it though
it s a cool Game1 Friendly fire2 Good graphic3 more updates4 very simulator5 people talk very selously
this game is a very Good Starter to Play if you want to get into the Tom Clancy s series my friends and i downloaded this to give it a Try and all that i can say is that i was very impressed for a Free Shooter game 8 10 would recommend
this game Gave_Me an Educational Insight into the average everyday Life of a normal goat i feel that the developers really nailed the Realism and Life likeness 10 10
i recieved Nuclear_Throne in a Humble monthly bundle and it is by Far the game that has recieved the most playtime from the bundle Nuclear_Throne is a rogue Lite Twin Stick Shooter with an interesting progression system within your runs your selected Mutant will be Able to accumulate Different mutations after each stage if you have Collected enough radiation drops from enemies there is a large Variety of guns which i doubt i Ve done More_Than merely scratch the surface of the Core Gameplay Loop is very enjoyable and i will continue to put hours into this Gem i do however have a few gripes with the Video choices within the game the framerate is capped at 30 i have Heard that this is a Problem with gamemaker Studio not necassarily the Devs though apparently when you create a project you have to explicitly choose a framerate for it to Run at and later on requires a Tonne of Work to Change perhaps the blame may Lie with the Devs on that one but Frankly it s not a Big issue for me Becuase of the existing graphical Quality of the game and it s not in first Person also the game is played in a 4 3 window within a 16 9 Interface i think this is an Odd design Choice but hey it hasn t affected the Gameplay for me i would also love a Story Mode for this game it doesn t have to be 30 hour campign or anything but i think it would Enhance the experience for me i will Ot however Hold this against the Devs overall 9 10i would highly recommend this game to any of my friends and the few Video oddities are overseeable you are getting great Value in this game
this game is amazing

this game simply has the Ultimate feel of amazingness i would reccomend this to anybody it just gives you a feel of how planets science Space and Everything_Else can be a dream Come true for just about anyone plus modding also gives such an amazing experience trying out New stuff seeing such cool things in the game in this game the only limit is Space itself nothing is impossible in this utterly amazing World of amazingness if you like either Space planets Stars Adventure thrill or anything else like that then you must get this game this game is Truly Worth the 27 00

great game really Good at scaring people in those awesomly scary first levels keep up the Good Work guys
really Good game very addictive and Fun and you can never get bored no matter how much time you spend on it
yup dis game is awesome
this game used to be very Fun and i used to Play this game a lot however with recent patches the game now requires much more grinding and removed the Fun element of everyone having an Equal chance players are Able to exploit the system and this results in unfair Gameplay some with cpu barely making the Mark are battling people whose cpu is just under the Mark this is extremely unfair furthermore this game is p2w with many in game compulsory stuff having to be paid for this game s Premium is extremely overpowered allowing New players to skip from a Low tier to a Way Higher tier in mere hours clearly this game has lost what made it unique and is now also p2w something that i am sure the steam Community would not like as after all this is supposed to be a Free to Play game
this game is Fun and balanced
good
depois Dessa att Minha sencibilidade mudou e Nao Volta Para o normal plz valve fix bug everywere
awesome
i would Estimate that it s slightly more addictive than crack cocaine
great game
absolutely amazing game i Ve played all Linear civilization games save for civ 2 and this has by Far been my Favourite i really wish they didn t stray from the feel of the first 3 civ games i m really not a Fan of the feel of civ 5 but alas the masses seem to disagree with me i don t want the bland Interface of the Fourth and Fifth games i want character and my loyal advisors to Guide me i don t want to set my political Civic Police state and my Economic Civic to central Planning i don t want to take whatever Social policy Tree with permanent effects no drawbacks or adopt the order ideology i want to use the Communism government and have my advisors refer to me as comrade as i Free to the proletariat of the World from the bourgeosie and the Fascist Aztecs the character of the game the Way events and history Play out managing your empire and waging War etc is simply really something and it really seems to Have_Been lost with the New civ games and the sad thing is it has so much potential for future games with more fleshed out content features etc definite 9 10
i learnt about some Big manatees and that was about it
it isd fuhn 11 11

after seeing this game on steam a while ago i thought hey a wwi trench Shooter that Might_Be Fun and boy was i right Verdun is an absolutely brilliant game and if you are in the least bit interested you should give it a go the Unity 5 engine Has_Been used to great effect and it has a smooth and immersive Gameplay some maps will lag for about 1 3 seconds however this is a rare occasion New updates seem to have fixed this this game is Worth every cent of the Price and is Far above the call of Duty for a game of this type the battlefields are amazing and it now has medals like the Medal of honour 9 10
Postal 2 is just Friggin amazing y u no has dis game yet
this game is Fun wtf r u doing without it
awesome graphics and High fps

awesome game love the 4 seasons turns per year and the Gameplay is smooth and Easy to get the Hang of i do recommend total War Attila as it s a great total War game and New total War players as well as the veterans will enjoy playing for hours but on the other hand i am very disappointed with the Way they are selling this game they should Be_Ashamed for selling factions as dlc s especially at 7 99 for 3 factions and so Close to the release of the full game just release the complete game and Stop making players Pay for it in Overpriced intallments
still needs alot of Work
this is a must Buy for steam users one of the Best games ever

after a long line of disappointing games in the Medal of Honor Franchise that just never could recapture the Magic successes of Allied assault we finally get Medal of Honor Airborne that combines High presentation values and Good Fast paced Fun while there s definitely some Good Entertainment Value here the campaign is short and the Multiplayer Isn t incredibly deep still it s a Good game overall and the Best game in the Franchise in some time Medal of Honor Airborne takes a Different Approach to World War Ii shooters instead of starting players out in each Linear Level on a path where there s no variation Ea La decided to let us choose where to start each Mission by throwing us out of a Plane once floating in the Air it s a matter of steering the parachute to the Best Location to start the fight where the Best Location is depends on how you want to Play the game a mechanic that certainly is useful if you want a Challenge or find that it s more Fun to start out in a Certain place on a Map it also provides an Opportunity to drop into a New Location if the previous one was a little too difficult or even complete one of the five Different skill drops drops in very specific areas
i would greatly Rate it out of 8 5 10 it is Hard and have a bit of glitch so when i click fold it give me call
people Who_Played Gunz will hate it because it s not Gunz people who didn t Play Gunz will hate it because it s a horrible game
a game full of noobs like sundeep
take chlothes of during lunch guards Come after me i Hit 1 with and bat 3 Hit me still running naked Run into Open area get shot by guard11 10 would Streak again
Good game but gfwl games for Windows live ruins the whole thing im glad i don t have an xboxi will how ever Rate this game as Good for the Fun of the gmae but still Get_Rid of gfwl

rift is a great game that everyone should Try out eventually even if they dont like what it looks like
pie
i really enjoy Garrys_Mod and counterstrike the thing that s annoying is that Garry s Mod doesnt have the same layout as Tf2 or counterstrike if you want to join a Multiplayer game
Best computer game ever
really Fun game Worth every Penny RIRE

sad sad Ubisoft don t get me wrong this is a beautiful extensive and immersive game it is an above ground and Underwater City Builder with Complex City Management and Trade however uplay is a horrendous Gaming Network and a drm of 3 installs is appalling to say it kindly when i discovered i could only install this on 3 machines i was quite disappointed Ubisoft Support also seems seriously lacking my Son recently made Purchase of a Hardcopy Ubisoft title registered it to his Account but could not download it was just stuck in a registration Loop he was outright ignored by Ubisoft uplay official Support Contact even after posting for Help on their facebook Page eventually he exchanged the game for something Worth twice as much and not needing uplay so he posted again to their facebook to let them know he didnt want their Assistance anymore because they are useless and he had solved his Problem within minutes they deleted his Post from the Page making us well aware that uplay had seen his Original Help request but they had deliberately ignored it i d hate to see what will happen when i have to Contact them for a New Key for Anno when i next upgrade my machine if the same drm restrictions exist for the New Anno when it is released i simply wont be buying it ever in fact my experience with the few uplay games i do own has Taught_Me to be extremely Wary_Of investing in any Ubisoft games again
at the time of writing this Review i do not yet own cities xxl or skylines so for me this is the Best City Builder i have in my Collection which includes banished Anno 2070 cities 2008 Tropico 4 as well as Rts builders like Red Alert 3 and aofe and i love it the graphics are incredibly beautiful and you can zoom in right up Close to the Action like google streetview to capture some amazing screenies of your City Day or Night it is very Entertaining to check out all the Wacky goings on of your inhabitants you can Select a car Pedestrian Truck or train and follow it around the Map travelling along the train tracks will allow you to explore the World of tunnels and underground stations you have constructed there s a lot of Micro mangement of all aspects your City including Trade between other players and cities youve built some may not like this aspect of the game but i find it quite enjoyable and challenging this is a massive game with lots to do to keep you entertained for endless hours there are plenty of gigantic maps and hundreds of buildings to choose from additionally the cities player Community is quite extensive and there are countless mods to Help you construct the City of your dreams i bought this game on special 15 long before xxl was released i hear there is little difference between the two games bar a few bug fixes Performance Improvement and a couple of New buildings i think if you are on a tight Budget and can grab this Version on a super sale say 5 then it is still Worth buying if you can t afford cities xxl
Fun yet challenging take on the dark Post Apocalyptic theme a simple Concept executed with a brilliant Balance of complexity and addictabillity Easy mediumm or Hard you only get 60 seconds hence the name of the game to collect supplies including your loved Ones from your House before a Mad Dash to take Cover in your underground Bomb_Shelter as your neighbourhood is being nuked above you can perfect your gathering skills in scavenger Mode Hone your stamina skills in Survival Mode or Play Out a complete scenario in Apocalypse Mode in which you first Scavenge your supplies and Family and then see how long you can Hold Out in your shelter with just the supplies you Ve brought with you quite soon you will find it necessary to go Out into the radiated wasteland of suburbia for more supplies well not always you often it s your Children you will encounter various events and make Life or death decisions along the Way things can get quite brutal light humour and cartoon Style makes this a great game the whole Family can enjoy highly recommended congrats to the Development team on a very clever release 5 Soup for you
i had never before played any game from the Bioshock Franchise nor even seen one played other than having Heard the name i had no Clue about the Concept Story genre or game Play Style i bought Bioshock infinite for 1 my Kids were silenced into disbelief when they saw it in my Library i had no idea what to expect what can i say i m in shock and awe spectacular a unique Story driven fps Bioshock infinite is stunningly beautiful yet surprisingly creepy and disturbing i m still not altogether sure wtf is happening or what i m supposed to be doing but i have superpowers and it looks amazing well done to the Development team 10 10 highly recommended
this game is incredible it is unique and addictive i love the fact there are no monsters and that i can choose to have timid Wildlife and just concentrate on scavenging crafting and Survival it allows me to take time considering my actions rather than being exhausted by pointless jump scares or wasting time hiding out crouched in some Bush Early access considered the long dark is quickly becoming one of my Favourite games i Ll admit though it s a lonely Adventure probably one of the few games i would like to see as a Multiplayer or at least some computer ai characters in which to occasionally interact however it certainly succeeds in making Me_Feel like i m wondering about Northern Saskatchewan or some such place the atmosphere is Enhanced by changing Weather and spectacular landscapes which glisten in the Sunlight i established a Base Camp on Day one gathered all manner of supplies and began crafting some Fancy Boots but i died 18 days later wandering about aimlessly in a blizzard 10 10 would cure animal guts on my bedroom floor again
this is a unique and Entertaining game for all ages i Hope the Online Service returns
yes to chess simply classic
10 10 would use my Face as a snowplough again
comes with one Free table so you can compete against your Family friends and the rest of the World there are also a huge Variety of themed tables available for Purchase with awesome sound and light effects cool multi tiered tables Mini challenges and games along with steam leaderboards and achievements at full Price the tables are great Value on sale they are steal i own several tables for this game on steam Android tablet and my phone Zen create Superior Contemporary pinball tables Worth every dollar i Ve spent for access on Multiple platforms it s pinball pinball is awesome highly recommended

it s Good though if your not an Alien or predator Fan than it might get boring the Alien Missions are pretty Good the Stealth is nice but don t Try to melee fight with the Alien because it sucks heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Marine is a Generic Shooter though it can be Fun making the Alien s heads explode predator idk didn t finish it because i Got bored the graphics are alright the finishing animations are nice but something seems off with some of them and they take Way too long sometimes Multiplayer seems Dead with the exception of probably 1 server thats on at Night usually american servers though i wouldn t bother getting the dlc

Bad timing for me to get because i bought it right before Our periodical exams if you like gangster games with a huge amount of wackiness this is a game for you
addicting as hell Buy it
is very cool
Best game ruined my Life the Best thing for f2p to Play only game that are awesome for someone that likw to be a Tf2 dont Play will your Life dont Go_Away Bad me i know we lost our wallet but still Worth it so Come Play c
very Good game Buy it no bugs or crashes yet
probably one of the most Fun Free to Play games true some items can only be obtained through paying actual money but you can still get Sweet loot as you Play the game Tf2 also has exciting Seasonal events such as the Halloween events but even during an ordinary Day or Month there s a lot of Different maps servers you can join in
i luv this game d thank you valve fo making it
i Ve only played 6 hours but i find this game very entertaing its Fast paced Gameplay gives you a Challenge aswell as the hrv to replace the absence of the Map overall i give it a 8 5 10 because i can t seem to find any Aussie servers
hardcore competitive but has highly Rich and fluent Gameplay Fast paced and Action packed takes skill to Master and is not beginner Friendly however i still recommend this game to everyone as this game is just Plain Fun Buy it
very Fun and addicting sandbox game that will kill many hours in your Life gametypes like trouble in terrorist Town are the Reason why you should Buy this game
Das spiel ist gut ich finde Es aber Schlecht Das man einefach ohne grund Vac gebant wird
mm is Good

the co Op in this game is some of the Best ive Ever_Seen the fact that the hiests can either go well and be pulled of without a Guard ever knowing you were there or the Entire hiest can Come crashing down in a manner bullits and Police men makes each hiest Different

a great zobie fps Multiplayer game the Devs are contstatly adding features since it is earlt access if you Ever_Played Dayz Mod this is a Step_Up in my opinion in terms of graphics and game Play encounters with players are Fun and can lead to intresting situations the animations are Better and so are the models a great game you should Buy
lots of Fun really enjoyed the mods

Good game if you like strategy
muitoo heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit
awesome game
amazing
the game has a lot of problems and i am going to List a few of them character facing the wrong side this is probably a bug no tutorial difficulties playing with keyboard some of the movements that you may want to learn located in Waza requires a Controller to execute but fret not there is a Way to learn all the movements if you Double tap your d Key it will Dash Forward however tapping excessively may Cause it to continuously Dash occasionally whenever i am in the Menu in game Menu not the title screen Menu my game may go into spasm Mode denying me from saving the game to selecting what i am going to train next is there a saving grace for this game yes there is make such amendments to the file kmslot1 not going to go into full detail since there is Guide for this and Max out your stats however there is still a Low moderate probability of you getting your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Beat by the ai
this game Reminds_Me of Final Fantasy xii and Final Fantasy x the Final Fantasy Franchise that i played also do not use the dlc characters particularly peashy and plutia while progressing to chapter 2 if you intend on playing the game as it is meant to be otherwise go ahead i will not include a pros and cons instead i will replace with things you should expect overall if you enjoy watching the anime and Manga chances are you are going to enjoy the game things to expect Fan services Moe some monster models are reused stupendously huge chest Vs Flat chest farming for plans these plans are basically items such as Weapons outfits and so on leveling of characters Partner Ranks
why should i write here oh right this source game is just amazing and i mean it back off call of Duty cuz your goin downtown
this is a briliant game and love it so much

muito Bom
muito divertido
jogo espetacular e muito emocionante recomendadissimo
jogo incrivel recomendadissimo
Hero Siege e um jogo perfeito e um rpg muito diferente do que os normais Com Uma jogabilidade quase Unica Alem disso apresenta Uma dificuldade intensa que desafia os players mais hardcore pontos positivos jogabilidade Unica tematica diferenciada musiquinhas show dificuldade intensa e Serio no Modo mais Facil ja e muito dificil Grande quantidade de personagens Free skills boladas Grande quantidade de saves pontos negativos personagens Pagos Nao gosto muito de jogos Pagos Onde Tem coisas pagas neles Nao gosto de ratos assassinos gigantes
Emily is away e um jogo muito interessante Tem Uma Historia boa Mas e muito triste cpontos positivos Historia envolvente e comovente Interface Style a Interface do Pc Antigo lembra muito o Antigo Win xp e o barulho Das teclas e muito Bom nostalgia Tudo freepontos negativos Historia Com so um Final odeio jogos de escolhas que Tem apenas um Final Historia curta Nao Tem trilha sonora c Seria muito legal escutar algumas musicas antigas Ia reforcar o tema Da Interface friendzone do Cara embora tenha mais pontos negativos do que positivos Eu Nao vejo Porque Nao recomendar o jogo Ele interessante recomendo Pra Quem Tem Tempo sobrando
o jogo em Si e muito Bom Tem personagens interessantes e Uma jogabilidade boa o Mapa e as missoes Sao praticamente iguais tornando o jogo Meio monotono Mas o maior problema Dele e que simplesmente enjoa Vc comeca a jogar e Seu objetivo Principal e comprar sobreviventes melhores e mais interessantes Mas os premios Das partidas Sao Tao baixos que Voce Acaba cansando mesmo antes de comprar aquele Tao esperado personagem boladao 7 10 divertido e legal Mas e extremamente enjoativo
aftermath e um jogo muito Bom Com graficos e Interface bons sons muito bons e Tem a tematica que Eu mais Gosto apocalipse Zumbi katchowrropontos positivos jogabilidade boa Recursos abundantes poucos bugs Interface simples e Facil de entender poucas pessoas nos servers isso e Bom Pra Quem Nao quer Levar Uns tiros e Free poarpontos negativos poucas pessoas nos servers isso e ruim Pra Quem Gosta de um pvp Bolado poucos itens comparado Com outros jogos desse Estilo repetitivo ja existem varios jogos Com Essa tematica aftermath e um jogo gratis Mas Nao Fica Tao atraz Dos outos jogos do Genero Como Dayz Ou infestation Pagos
Carpe Diem e um jogo simples e Curto gostei do jogo Mas e so Para Quem Gosta de visual novel pontos positivos Historia bacana legendas em Pt Br trilha sonora boa Sua waifu Nao exist deixa quetopontos negativos jogo muito Curto Sem muitas escolhas Final igual Para todas as escolhas bugs incoerencia Da legenda embora de Para entender Sua waifu e igual a ai sorry o que voce Ta fazendo Da Sua Vida
o jogo e Bem legal e Eu recomendo o Unico problema Dele tirando o Fato de Ter poucos jogadores e que o ping e muito Alto e isso dificulta e muito no Gameplay 6 10 legal Mas Com um ping horrivel e poucos jogadores
awesome adventuring game
i would highly reccommend no more Room in hell to anyone who enjoys an fps Horror Action or Survival with ailments such as infection and bleeding and other such things makes this not only one of the Best but also the most realistic Zombie themed games ever made
i would reccomend this game for older Kids that are older then 12 because u will want your Kids to sleep and u dont want them to rade RIRE
the Best f2p game ever 3
awesome game
awesome game
awesome game but the only Bad thing is its the same as Tf2 but just re skin of characters so im putting it as a Thumbs_Down sorry for the people who like it
this is a great game it is so awesome and the graphics are amazing go get it go Play it go enjoy yourself
awesome
its a Good game for all ages the Gameplay is very Fun and i recomend you to Play it
not really a Good game its pretty boring and i wish there were more game modes its Overpriced and has some bugs that need fixing it still has a Good Gameplay but i wish it was Better in conclusion its a 4 5 10
great game only played a bit but already the feel of Mordor is terrifying there are no bugs and the npc humans are funny i spent my money well and i cant Wait to keep playing
as a Fan of the call of Duty Franchise i have to say i m very disapointed in Black Ops 3 not to brag but i was very Good at the other call of Duty games but the Mix of jetpacks sliding and Wall running all with the same Mechanics as the Old call of dutys just does not Work for me i Ve played about 10 Multiplayer games so Far and have had no Fun what so ever Gun customization would Have_Been great if they added a Free draw Tool instead of having to move various shapes and size them correctly originally i bought the game for zombies shadows of Evil only Map so Far is very Different from other Cod zombies i have played and has a massive area ive played 3 games and continuously get lost in the maze of Zombie filled streets Downing countless times Far away from my team mates as for graphics my geforce 740m couldnt handle the High Graphic setting so i had to lower everything including shadows player models and textures down to medium and my render Quality to 80 in order for me to have smooth game Play to finish of this Review i m going to conclude that im disapointed in this New addition to the series and i Hope they can release a ww1 or ww2 game or maybe even anoth Mw i didnt mind Advanced warfare but bo3 certainly puts the icing on the cake then just heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing Picks_Up the cake and throws it out the window onto your neighbour s Cat who then screams in agony because it s allergic to chocolate so you have to go to the vet with your Grumpy Old neighbour and finally after 20 minutes of waiting you are given the News from the vet that the Cat will never see your neighbour is extremly heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit and start to Pull_Out his Gun but you pull your magnificent Gun which is designed with a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit spirting heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out of your back Pocket and fire 20 bullets into his skull only to find out you had Monitor lag and he shoots you twice and somehow kills you that kiddies is why you should not wastes over 40 Bucks on this game go Buy Mw
this is a game filled with strategy elements as well as a Good Shooter i had trouble aiming with a Controller but besides that is is absolutely Worth the 50 Cents i Got it for
the Best game eveer i Ve played the campaign about 6 times over and i love every Update aliens was awesome and i m hoping to see some more interesting features added to the game great for when the Gang get together and i certainly had a Laugh Flying on those pigs deffinately Worth the 15 dollars
challenging game and mind numbing but it is a great and addicting game i hate it when you place the Block in the wrong place
when i Try to launch it it keeps saying that it stopped working
this game is very nice for this Day and Age its also a lot of Fun plus its so statisfying blowing of a z e d s Head in Slo Mo mmh
team fortess 2 is a game for anyonewanna go Round killing stuff can do Wan na have Fun on a Friendly server yup Robots yes Better not forget hats Tf2 has loads so much Customisation
the game is awesome and is f2preasons why u should get this Game1 this is i very Good looking game as if it is in hd2 loads of Weapon and character customization More_Than Team_Fortress_2 3 you can get loads of stuff by just playing it 4 freeget this game as it is awesome

10 10 Best game ever Good Story line Best animation one could ask for the reading was just perfect when it went off Topic and of Course oppaialso this game Taught_Me japanses Culture of games which meant all Main chracters Are dense as hell 11 10 game of the year
i like watching the matches it really gives u a sense of what competitive Gaming really feels like and ehome were outstanding and doing well but it almost looked like they were going to break the computers Online Kingdom were also playing well as well all though they did not make it so Far i feel they played very well na Vi well speechless Good teamwork and Trust in one another Gd team Combo and for all the other teams out there Gd Job as well
11 10 game of the year awarded for me Best game ever

i played 3 things so Far with my few hours experiencett trouble in terrorest Town is a really great minigame that is at the start of the game you collect guns grenades and you get either 15 30 seconds to prepare the innocent needs to find the traitor traitors and Kill_Them and you Win if you Kill_Them Detective is pretty much the same thing traitor needs to kill the innocent and Detectives to Win prop Hunt has the same objective as hide and Seek Irl hunters need to Hunt props and props need to hide and blend in with the Map you are in but beware when you are a Hunter every Bullet you shoot counts as some of your hp Health points Sand Box is your own little World you can spawn items Drive cars kill zombies and even Invite your friends to Come and playi highly recommend this game it was Worth my money to get and who ever reads this i Hope you enjoy it also

Dear Gearbox we both know that borderlands is a great series so why Aer you killing it clearly your use of 2k australia to produce to the produce the game while you develope battleborn is a scam to steal my money dlc is what makes borderlands games what they are are you telling me that this piece of Bs is Good dlc are out of your freaking mind rather than Waste time building arenas why don t you actually make another Story and add some much needed weaponry oh and do not give to 2k australlia they already took all the funny humor out of borderlands you really don t need them yours Truly Skitz
after a total of 600 hours of playtime in this game i can honestly say this is my Favorite game its just so Good in terms of Gameplay its just like a normal fps but its Better because of the Variety in Weapons and in specail skills while my Favorite is the gunzerker which can dual wield Weapons other specails include turning Invisible trapping people in inescapable aurasphere thing and summoning turrets Are all extremely diverse and compelling abilities 10 10 by Far

was a very Good game during beta unless planetary Weapons Have_Been balanced such as the planet destroying Laser the game is lopsided would not recommend unless changes are made as initial Leader in unit fabrication will most likely develop this planet Laser first as the Weapon has no use limit you are Free to Destroy every planet until the enemy Command comes to your planet i wish the beta was back
11 10 ign like call of Duty but with guns
very Fun to Play but what eVer you do do not Get invested in the game it will e the end to you and your Pc Collateral_Damage
if you like games that are full of Action bursting with Magic or just a great awesome mmo Dota_2 by valve is an awesome game for you
great game if you love science explosions or building Random stuff that can Blow_Up in your Face

Good game this creative game 8 10
it is so laggy on the laptop but Good game Play
Ok this game may not have the greatest graphics but this all can Change i have never played a Better Cop aimulator than this if you ever saw the movie lets be cops its a movie then do you remember the second time he went to sell his game and it was an amazing pitch well this is that game it is amazing all it needs is your Support and this game Could_Become so much more i Could_Be a masterpeice it just needs your Support
i love this game it is exactly like Dayz except i Could_Be Better if the added a Map so you know where your friends are and where the hell your going
you Play a Border costums Agent and you have to handle with strange sanarios such as you deal with a senile Old man and a man with a bomb straped to his Stomach and even a pimp sneeking his Girls into a diferent Country and there is a man running from the Police to hide from a murder that is how Good the Gae is and its great
its great just need to make it faster on a laptop
i love Arma and all that comes with it but they need to make it faster on laptops
Good game must Buy for Cod fans
thirstyoh cool lets spray this satedwouldnt Hurt if i do it again overwatered Ooh what happens if i do it one more time deadr i p plantie
i recommend Tf2 for all fps players its Fun and its Free

passionately Wait for the meter to rise for your Hero and you Journey through various stages ending up staring at your computer screen for More_Than 4 hours
a must get for people who like quake although it may not be as Fast paced or have the same Weapons it is still beyond some of the most recent mmos out there Te skiing is also a great addition a great Play for anyone
you can really see the potential here when you Play the Alpha for an Alpha i am amazed at the Level of detail already in it and the difficulty means that you really do apreciate every Win you get in game a really great Play and much easier to Play with mates
lef 4 Dead um jogo muito Bom e um jogo Bem que e injoativ0 koaksoaksoaksoaksoaks

muito Bom Mas Vo compra Uma Placa de Video nvidea geforce Para melhorar

love this game if you like call of Duty or battlefield you will love this game 10 10
payday 2 is a great Action packed game it has provided me with so many hours of Fun 10 10
awesome loved it 10 10
an amzing game definately recommending it to everyone
it s a very Good game with a lot surprises to Come in the future i Ve played this game for a few days now on a server and its been a very enjoyable time when you get Head shotted out of no where and you Head shot people from Far away ask your friends to Play with you to survive the Apocalypse or Play alone
a Fast paced fps this is the game you all Have_Been waiting for combining call of Duty Esque Gameplay Mechanics and awesome Concept this game has hooked many and retained even more playing as a pilot inside a giant Mech players Run around shoot and generally Try to blow each other s heads off while the upgrade path is leaning towards Pay to Play it is not impossible to unlock everything with just game time but expect to put a load of hours in all in all an amazing game for it s Price RIRE but with a slightly unfair upgrade system this is a game you should not go past a solid 8 5 10
well this Isn t a Bad game as such i Ve played it through twice and the ending is always the same boring grind chapters 1 4 are extremely egaging on the first Play through but it becomes obvious how forced the Story is when you Play it through the second time the chat mechanic makes you feel sort of in Control of the Story but again on the second Play through you realise how little the choices you make actually matter to the overall narrative the game Concept is very Good but as with all text based games the Story needs to be strong and if you re gouing to implement a Choice mechanic it would Be_Nice if it actually did something overall 6 10 as i did Play it through twice and the first time was engaging enough if this game was p2p this would be a solid 2 10
adore this game so much just get it and youll see what i mean
Red Alert 5 needed
hell cool game
this is a really Fun game i would do Practice if you just herd of it
que Buen juego Ahora Lo crackeo y Lo Subo a internet
excelente juego pero Es Una picardia 10 y denunciado

great game especially when played with friends would definetely reccomend it to anyone wanting some hilarious co Op Action it Isn t as Fun when you re by yourself but it is still a very solid Single player puzzle game 8 10
when i first played this game i joined a server Got some Wood made some Armour and Weapons and then made a nice House then one Day i was in the Forest looking for Food and some Guy attacked me and Killed_Me for my pants this was Fine i Got the rest of my Gear back and then went to sleep in my House when i joined again someone had Killed_Me in my sleep and taken all my stuff fml0 10edit nothing rusts
i saw one Hammer in this game and it was on the home screen0 10

Terrible de Weno
warframe is my type of game its the Best
this game is awesome it has a unique and great Style of Combat great graphics also the Hud is also great and really makes the pilot feel while playing two Thumbs_Up bdcons is somehow looking like a Pay to Win since with Cash you can literally get what you need in the long Run unlocking Early items and getting the Mechs which somehow ruins the Fun but hey it s f2p who am i to Judge 3
this game is f0k1ing Bad youll get flaged but the ai wont they dont guve a f0k this game sucks

this game is definitely my Favourite game it is also undoubtably telltale s Best game the Style of game this is makes it amazing it gives you a sense of urgency as you don t have much time to decide on Life or death situations this game offers so many possiblities for Different storylines it makes you want to Play it as many times as you can to see what is Different your choices decide how the ending goes down but what choices you make also don t effect what happens in the end i would always recommend this game
another excellent game that all Star wars fans will love no matter which trilogy they like

an excellent game Star wars fans will be hooked for hours on end
o jogo e mto Bom viciei
this game has everything you d want from a first Person Shooter full of Fun and actoin wiht cool items to spice up game Play
Boderlands_2 was one of the Best money i have ever spent the combination with voilence and all the little jokes kept me smiling all the Way through the game everyone was hoping it to be just as Good as the first one but let me tell you thus it exceeds it in anyway the New side Missions are not as rewarding as i would have hoped for but they still are Good terraphormes was a bit like crawmax but did not give as much loot which was a bit of a downer but the addition of a few New wepons balaenced it out perfectly i have yet to Buy the dlc but when i do it gon na be awesome so anyone who like jampacked Action with a great sense of humour im Warning you if u dont get this game u are missing out

this game is great it has everything a Good Crazy fps like Tf2 could offer it has the Good Mix of Crazy with call of Duty and batman the only thing is there is no one and i mean no one in the lobbies i havent played the game in Multiplayer yet thats how deserted this Gane is so if you can advertise this game more then it Could_Be Better i would rather have full game servers than empty Ones p

Best game ever 11 10
i have a couple of things to say about this game 1 this game is probably not Worth playing and i d rather move on to watching bamboo Grow or my skin to Peel away or my toenails rot2 honeslty i reckon that the Trailor for this game is Better than anything else in the actual game 3 your probably gon na have less lag playing Skyrim on Ultra High graphics on a cheap 1990 Nokia phone then you will playing this on a 10 00 customised top of the line computer with Nasa wifi speeds is this game all that Bad y e s but there is some actually very important stuuf in this for examplethis game helped teach my younger Brother how to uninstall a game on steam Bless you jagex 310 10 would rather Pay 15 to uninstall this game than to Buy it
realy Fun and involves stratergy un like Cod where you Run in and noscope every one but you team because there is no Friendly fire in Csgo your team has to plant the bomb or save the hostages and in competative Friendly fire is on which means you have to Pay atention to every thing so you dont kill your team mates you also have to manage your income because if you and your team are doing realy Bad you may not be Able to Aford a Gun the knifes are Soo expensive even though you use your primary and secondary wepons more someknifes are Worth 2 00 which ridiculas and if some one buys that insted of a Good Pc than there Plain stupid with out a doubt a realy realy Fun game and so satisfying when you get a kill game reveiw by Jack silver Ray
team mates are either pros or useless all about Luck of what team you get put with
awesome for a f2p the Gameplay is thrilling the graphics are Good no matter what setting you have it on and they are always updating it which means the admins actually Try which i find very rare for f2p
the only thing that ruined this game was that after you Buy an item you get a Certain amount of time with it
great graphics for it s Age and very Fun and long Gameplay had a bit of a Problem with Windows live at the start but Got it fixed one of my favouritegames of all time
4 years since the game came out and still discovering New places 10 10
Good and Fun but it says there is Multiplayer but its not wat i expected i was Hoping for servers with like 25 players in them not just Lan still a Good game tho
this game is so Fun and intresting
Good for a Free to Play not a Pay to Win type of game for once only Problem tho is there is like a 11 7gb Update which takes a while but after the Update its totally Worth the Wait

i Ve played the game for over 4 years now i didn t start on this Account but ive been loyal to this game since 2012 i may not be the Best player but i personally think this game is amazing as it helps me let off steam and stress in real Life by killing some monsters it Has_Been needing New owners and i think Deca were perfect for it i Hope they do successfully with the game i wont be quitting anytime soon ign xxlegionhd
hello ive noticed a bug on the servers where when i Try to join it loads but instead of going to the server im brought back to home screen

este juego Es de Lo mejor Lo recomiendothis game is the Best recommend
haunted a beehive and watched as my friends died before my Eyes Worth a game full of so many Bad situations that you can t Help but Laugh at
10 10 would set fire to steam punk patriots again
sound idea but poorly executed the excitement felt for exploring the galaxy and discovering New aliens and planets soon wore off after i realised that most of my time would be spent grinding for materials just to keep myself alive also Worth mentioning is that this game promoted itself upon exploring planets which are unique and Different form one another due to randomisation however randomisation can only get you so Far and without New textures planets get Old real Fast don t get me wrong i like the game and i Ll most likely Play it when i m looking for a slow paced game when i m feeling Stressed_Out but i simply can not justify paying around 80 Aud for this game in it s current state tldr much too expensive for what you re getting at this Point in time Buy it when it s on sale if you Wan na check it out
de Todos os jogos que Eu tenho esse e um Dos que Eu mais recomendo Pra Quem Gosta de jogos de sobrevivencia e Mundo aberto o jogo Se superou nisso Critica Positiva o jogo e muito Bem feito muito dificil de encontrar bugs e Da Pra Se divertir muito Com Ele Junto de inumeros server Com varios outros players Critica negativa Eu pessoalmente prefiro a versao Alpha do jogo Dava Pra jogar de boa e Nao era muito complicado de Fazer as coisas ja a Nova versao que Todos estao jogando Fico extremamente diferente levei um Bom Tempo Para me acostumar e ficou muito pesado Bom mesmo Com alguns problemas recomendo muuito esse jogo principalmente Pra jogar Com os Amigos e isso p

i used to think that games used to be about skill and how well you Work with a team of freinds strangers all that changed when i Got Tf2 Hat Simulator 2014 i am educated now and know that the things you need to be Good at this game are unusual hats Worth only 500 a once full now empty Life savings Account hats hats hatsin this game you will Select one of 9 characters which all have their special Op power which will make even the most patient Monk rage quit this game is about your character going on a pointless perilous Journey in order to get all the Keys ever made by valve no one knows why you Try and complete this Story but if you don t your freinds might get more Keys than you and you don t want that eventually you spend all your money and or Life to Buy these over priced hats and boast to some Guy on the other side of the World about how cool your 5600 Hat is only to have him call you a n00b and show you his 56001 Hat and proceed to kick you from the server for being a skrublord in this game you will experience several gamemodes such as kick everyone on the server who makes a Mistake a k a Tour of Duty Practice of kick everyone on the server who makes a Mistake a k a Boot Camp show off your sexy hats to people who you deem beneth thyself a k a Trade servers School of sniping a k a 2fort Custom gamemodes which can somtimes be more Fun the the Default game a k a Custom games every other gamemode with people who you deem free2play a k a every other gamemode with people who you deem free2play the Best part of the game apart from the 10 10 Hat simulation is when after 10 mins of you being one of the only contributors to your team and right about to Win the game with your freinds you get switched for auto ballance Ad end up on a loosing Streak so fuun and Best Feature of any game because of this game i have no money no freinds and no Life but i have hats and really Isn t that what Life is all about 10 10 would Play again
juego espectacular Lo recomiendo a Todos Se Lo recomiendo Si no Les llega El Dinero pues esperen a Una oferta

after completeing all the levels with the Main protagonist here is my Review 8 5 10 the games Random elements keep thing interesting but i find myself cysling through the rng untill i find one that is a little easier it does Help the game stay fresh when you are repeating a Level generally several times the difficulty starts relatively High and only continues for the most part as the game progresses if you find the first Level frustratingly difficult and have played less than 2 hours consider gettign a refund as it only gets harder Level design is wonderful with enough Variety that even though the game never changes its machanics it doesn t get boring with the difficulty so High you genuinally feel a sense of Achievement when a Level is completed the artstyle while simple is brilliant as is the sound design i just wish there was a Fast Reset Button overall it is the first game in a long time i have completed one that has challenged me but not to the Point of giving up i give a solid 8 5 10 now to continue with the unlockable charactures

Garry s Mod is a Physics sandbox unlike Regular games there aren t any predefined aims or goals we give you the tools and leave you to Play you spawn objects and Weld them together to Create_Your_Own contraptions whether that s a car a Rocket a catapult or something that doesn t have a name yet that s up to you if you re not too great at Construction don t worry you can place a Variety of characters in Silly positions 9 10

most Fun game everywould not take Physics classes anymore 0 10 Learned too much
very very very very very awesome game
fantastic game it allows one to think really deep into the obstacles in this game but sometimes mind crushing i had to think for 30 mins to solve a Map before
fantastic game lots of gamemodes and large Variety of Weapons not those type of mmo s that is not paid to Win where everything is that is exclusive is possible to get if you take the time and hours to farm for it
it s been a long Way since Elder scrolls started and this is the Best one yet Skyrim has Enhanced the limits of Multiple games and proved that a Sword slashing gory game is possible not to mention the mods makes the game alot more interetsing as well
after playing 500 hours on this fantastic fps it s Gameplay and Multiplayer Action is just spot on expected of valve it s realistic recoil and other features make this game a must Buy
great game Good Physics l0l

this fps Shooter game really packs a punch i m in a competition in this game there is a Reason why i joined it

Vale La Pena echarle un vistazo
sinceramente El que no Lo descarge Porque Es Malo o no Le gustan Los fps Es un tarado 100 recomendado este Hermoso juego Lo Malo Es que Es Pay to Win demasiado p2w Mucho pero Mucho p2w y Las Armas Para conseguirlas con Dinero Del juego tienes que echarle Bolas

every now and then a game with a really cool Concept gets put on steam and i Play it and i have Fun rise of Flight United is a great example of a Good game being screwed over entirely by one Feature that Feature is the Dread microtransactions the lifeblood of Free games and the Terrible part of Gaming at the start of the game you have 3 planes or so thats all the planes you have unless you want to Pay 20 dollars for four stupid planes four the game is Good overall but technically only 3 planes in the damn game i can not reccomend this
Mod allows you to Play in Candyland 10 10 would brutally murder people again

planetside 2 is an mmo fps rpg and one of the first of it s kind it was developed by sony Online Entertainment soe a well known game Development company behind mmos such as Everquest Dc Universe and the Original planetside as it s name suggests it takes place in Humanity s future on the faraway planet of auraxis three powerful factions the Terran Republic New conglomerate and Vanu sovereignty slug it out to Control as much Territory and resources as possible you fight on 4 unique continents large maps where huge often awesome battles with Infantry ground vehicles and Aircraft occur planetside 2 is a game to be played with a squad or platoon of friends as playing Lone Wolf can be difficult repetitive and at times boring in organised outfits clans though the game can create great memories it requires a decent computer and it s detailed large Scale environments and battles can take down the fps on cheaper rigs i m going to give planetside 2 an 8 out of 10
love it love it love it love it nothing else needed to be said

if you like team based strategy games this is the Ultimate Version if you prefer being a Lone Wolf dont even download it overall Fun game would reccomend it

from my experiences of playing the Early access Alpha Verson of Darkwood is suprising really Good yes i Ve copped a few well not really jump scares but spooks as in loud sounds and Hearing of things around in the Woods i d love the smoothness of the Gameplay and the graphics for the Bird Eye Perspective is really Good i m digging into the storyline of the whole game so Far not gon na tell any spoilers sorry what they Hopefully will do in the completed game of this is you could Able to Build_Your_Own shelters in the Woods like Minecraft get Wood make the walls for the House make a chest wardrobe make the Windows or Door barriaded sorry for the Spelling and just other things that make the game more interesting and more intense as well overall i m really enjoying the game i think it s well made and in my opinion it s one of the Best Alpha games i Ve played in a long time i Ll give it 10 10 Good Job guys
Dayz is a Zombie Survival game that was first known in the arma2 mods it became a very Mod and alot of people enjoyed it in this Dayz standalone game you Ll encounter alot of things that made you go wtf for an example when your inside a House building most of the time the zombies somehow go through the floors and walls of the House and inmanged to Hit you and make you bleed to death one of the other things that makes it Bad is some consumbles such as clothes mostly and Food are floating above the ground flooring and you can t pick them up i honesty can t fully Judge on the game that it s still under developing but what i can say is it feels more realistic the Way you die like hunger thrist bleeding to death and poisoning when you get soaked from Rain or Pond you Ll move slower than normal which it makes it harder to outrun the zombies on a positive note i Ll definitely recommend to Play Buy the game and have Fun with friends and become Zombie slayers 7 10
nice

great game and is definatlely Worth playing but be careful you might get Addicted other than this it is an amazing first Person Shooter where you can pick 1 of 9 classes all with Different ways of playing and Different strategies The_Community is also great you can Trade and Work your Way up with items and a lot of other interesting things too my Favorite thing to do is Play Saxton Hale servers or prop Hunt both of which are very carefully Planned and thought out wellwell done to the steam develpoers10 10
amazing game not to difficult and not to Hard i really liked it and would recommend to anyone Whoo likes adventur and Fun a great time Waster i loved the hunting parts they were my Favourite enjoy it
this game was interesting when i very first started it but Got boring Easy i dont recommend downloading this game sorry guys
okay after a while you know when there going to jump scare its really difficult and gets boring quite quickly in my opinion this game is the second Scariest out of the 3 the third being the most Scariest and the second game a waist of time and money i really dont know if i recommend this or not
wow Soo much to say about this game where to start well for starters no matter how many other Better games you find on steam Skyrim the Witcher Wild Hunt any other game you will never get as much enjoyment out of them as you will Terraria you will never Beat the classics such as Minecraft no matter how many times you tell yourself you dont like it anymore but tbh Terraria is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing amazing you think the producers of Minecraft have it Hard of Course they do its a 3d game everythings difficult even tho Terraria is a 2d game it has so much more content including bosses Weapons biomes enemies items npc s tools ores and a lot more like srrsly you think or Minecraft then think of everything is has Terraria has it but about 5 times more especially items Terraria has like 50 times more items then Minecraft minecraft just simply cant compete with Terraria you spawn into a randomly generated World with a shortsword pickaxe and an Axe you find a Tree chop it down make a House make some background walls so enemies cant spawn in there then with the rest of the Wood a workbench some tools to mine Better ores to make Better Weapons look at Wiki or do it yourself spawn an Easy Boss and Destroy it with the amazing New Weapons you have scavenged and made collect its drops to save up copper silver Gold platnium coins to Buy unique items from npc s such as awesome Weapons and humorous items to make your Gameplay even more Entertaining and just when you think its over a meteor lands you go find its Location attempt to mine it without getting killed from burning to death or demolished by meteor heads use the meteor Armor Weapons and tools to go deeper underground to find and mine some Gold once you have the Gold you make ingots and Gold Armor and Weapons get Better Weapons to go aall the Way down to the underworld a k a hell RIRE to mine some hellstone make a giant pathway thought the underworld kill a voodo Demon and get a Guide Doll drop it in lava and summon the Wall of flesh with Multiple attempts to kill it you will then basically have a New game killing the Wall of flesh unlocked hardmode harder enemies New bosses Destroy the Demon altars with the Hammer the Wall of flesh drops which spawns in New Better Stronger ores to mine anyway i highly recommend buying this game hours and hours of Fun i just this game is amazing please Buy this gametell all your friends about this gameget them to Buy this gamebuy this game for themwhatever you can you need this game to end your sad little Life and make it a Good oneanyway take Care
great game
Los graficos Son mejores y Esta mejor q antes
muito Bom
Minecraft with a rpg element great combination
awesome Survival game to Play with friends
already played a little and i cant Stop
for those who love platformers dubstep and really really Hard games will love this game
this is the game of my Childhood i love how i can now Play it on my computer i must say that this is one of the Best games ever and deserves a spot in Gaming history d
War thunder is a Free to Play ftp game developed by gijin Entertainment it is a pvp and pve ai game focusing on Tank and Plane battles this game is great for people looking to fly their Favourite Plane and or Tank
Garry s Mod is one of the Best games i have this game is very very addicting and Fun to Play if you don t have get it now all the gamemodes are very Fun and a great game to Play with friends
this game is amaing absolutly amazing the charaters are awesome and fleshed out the Story is awesome and the gamepley is fantastic i can say that this is my Favorite rpg of all time in my opinion no other rpg beats it not even Skyrim the Gameplay is Different from most Role_Playing_Games first off you can t jump second off before you fight it always pauses so that you can plan your attacks one of the coolest things about the game you can also take Control of your Party members so that you can tell them attaks you want them to do you can tell bioware really thought out this game so withthat i conclude my Review
Cs go the 3rd major installment in valve s Counter strike series i Ve found myself playing it a lot lately it s a nice Change from the normal ads shoot kill Respawn Wash rinse repeat that Multiplayer fps games have become it does have a difficult Learning curve though if you expect to login the first time and be global Elite you Ve Got another thing coming i Ve played around 150 hours now and i still find myself Very Low on the ranked Spectrum it s an amazing game and if you re like me and things like cosmetiCs Appeal to you this is perfect i love going into a game and Hearing people saying they like my skins don t know why i just always have

of Course the graphics are kind of dated right here and the Gameplay is repetitive but the Fun is where you teamed up with your friends to survive this so called Zombie Apocalypse to kill or to be killed is all on your Hands

Skyrim where to start really the greatest game in the Elder scrolls series and possibly the Best Open World game around will keep you going for a very long time two things i really love are the endless combinations of items you can equip and the copious amounts of loot you can collect i highly reccomend it
possibly one of the Best games ive Ever_Played when i say game i mean completely out of this World insane riduculous Fun

this game was a tough platinum to achieve but if you like games with amazing music get this
costume Quest is a lovable Adventure you will never forget and if you do forget it you are Dead to me this game is a superb jrpg with great Level designs which sometimes want you to get a walkthrough i had to use a walkthrough about 3 4 times the Story is a bit short but if you did all side quests like me you would at least have about 6 7 hours put in this if you didnt do all side quests you would have approximately 2 4 hours put in this the game is beautiful for a Halloween themed game coffins are chests you can trick or treat houses for candy or enemy encounters Battle stamps which improve your character in fights and several comedic speeches for all ages i absolutely adore this game just like in every rpg game there is a leveling up system in order to Level up you Defeat enemies just like every rpg it does take quite a while to Level up in this game but that made me want to farm enemies and Destroy bosses every game excluding racing games contain bosses i think these bosses were rather time consuming but if you had the right costumes for your team it would be a piece of cake i did find one Boss in the game rather annoying but dont want to spoil it i would say something about the Boss but just Wait till you fight her there are costumes you find from side quests or just Main quests these costumes Play a Big part of the game not just because its the games title but you actually get Different move sets aswell the costumes i found made the Final Boss a 1 Try Victory for me the game can be a bit Easy if you get guides on where the costumes are located and its pieces there is another playable dlc you get automatically if you Purchase this game on steam called grubbins on Ice it s not extremely long its about 1 3 of the games length i did enjoy it though because it Gave_Me three costumes several Battle stamps and a nice Adventure i would prefer playing this after the Base game because everthing from your first save in costume Quest gets sent over into the dlc it s pretty helpful it is recommended to do that because enemies are about Lvl 13 and your Cap is Lvl 10 in the Base game this game is a Master piece literally i love it so much and for the Price i Got it for 99 Cents in the 2015 Holiday sale it was Worth it if you see this game going for about 5 or less Purchase it immediately this title is a must Buy i love you Double Fine productions
its alright
Best dlc ever
realm of the Mad God is legit one of the Best games i have Ever_Played i m surprised an 8 bit mmorpg is f2p realm of the Mad God requires just 2 things to install and Play for the rest of your Life this game is one of my Favorite games especially with friends whenever i get bored i Play this game and i get hooked on it for a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit amount of time i bring my laptop with me to lunch and dinner i love the fact that the creators on this game have made it Free to Play like that is what makes me happy i also love the fact you can Work together and fight extremely Hard bosses you Work your Way up to fight Oryx the Mad God this game is great and recommend playing its only like 18 Mb so its pretty small for a great game i m giving this game a 11 10 love it entirely love everything about this game
nice and Easy game but not a lot of people playing Gun monkeys so im giving it 8 5 10
this is it the game you Have_Been waiting for Drum Roll unturned this game features a load of things to do such as crafting survivel and zombies alot of people are saying it is where Minecraft Meets Dayz and that is true catch ya all on the Flipside bros and Sis s
i dont recommend this game to anyone it sucks Big time if you are a Noob and have no Life u should get this game
Terraria is a shockingly awesome game similiar to Minecraft it has Multiple worlds but it allows you to name your character it gives you a sense of character progression for said player to find his her Origins to find why he Has_Been dropped on this Island World Minecraft has that also you say well Terraria injects steroids into that aspect the possiblities in this game is endless it gives a rpg feel allowing you to slay monsters for Currency and Trade said Currency for Goods from various merchants many players of Minecraft that don t understand what Terraria is they say it is a copy of Minecraft it Isn t it is a delicate game with loads of content as of the 1 3 Update when Terraria is on sale for the holidays i would recommend it to people that Haven t tried this game
e muito Bom Pena que porcausa de Uma atualizacao Bugo Meu Dota

its a third Person Shooter that is Fun ive been playing for a while and it is Fun you know what go on ahead Try it
i think its the Best game ever for the sequel of Portal
Tf2 is an amazing game that i have Ever_Played i like being all 9 classes Becasue they have many useful weaponsa
i Got arrested for nearly stabbing a Guy with a Shank and then Got put in Jail in Jail i found a Shank and in the end Got to stab that Guy then i died in a shower from thrist great game
if this didnt lag much on my laptop i would have much more hours on it
Zombie steaker Sim 2014
not the Best of games but still pretty Fun i Got this game during awesomenauts Star storm Kickstarter as part of my donation package which i still havent gotten all of yet Dx and i had some Fun for the time i Ve played it not a game i thought i would like but i Play it every time and time again
why get Battle Block Theater well its by the Studio which did Castle crashers and that was Good Fun and this Ones Fun too so uh get it
i Got Vac banned from Cs go but i aint Mad i Got a copy of it right here
all mods from half Life have become a standalone game the Stanley parapables this game ect and they all Have_Been great and Garry s Mod is no exception with your gravity Gun and Physics Gun from Half_Life_2 and the Tool Gun you can make a Rocket propelled bathtub a nuclear powered Wheel Chair and so much more this game has a great Single player Mode giving you time to make amazing creation without the harasment of others Multiplayer is great playing with friends or with Random people and its always Different i recommend this game to everyone but to get the full experience you will need to Pay a bit Extra to get games that add more Counter strike source Half_Life_2 ect but it is Worth it in the end by adding more gamemodes like tt trouble in terrorist Town by getting Counter strike source defidently get this game with Counter strike source 10 10

awsome game kinda sucks when u die Cause you lose ur stuff but other then that its awsome
Better then Leonardo Dicaprio s Grammy award10 10
10 10 for sure
the game is quite Good but it needs more potential more atmoshpere and maybe add the option to Run aswell your protagonist moves extremely slow and your first objective takes hours to complete and the Map seems quite large for beginners where do we even know where to go the brightness for this game is very Low making the player Struggle to see the flashlight Isn t as bright infact it s brightness is very Low the Weather and Biome make it very difficult to see sure the games Free but needs improvment the game is quite glitchy and buggy making the Gameplay very difficult your sensitivity is Low and the graphics are very Bad and require improvment aswell the games atmosphere Isn t great and i expected to Meet into your antagonist Aka slenderman while doing your first objective the games making it like slender Isn t even included it just reveals the vandilism he s caused it s difficult to find him infact he doesn t even make an appearence in the game that much as said it just reveals the vandilism he s caused in conclusion to make this game Better it just needs some tweaks and improvments to Advance it s Gameplay a little
Bienvenido a rapture Una Ciudad de proporciones inmensas y situada En El Oceano atlantioo fundada Por un Tal Mr House quiero decir Andrew Ryan El Hombre que Eligio Lo imposible Eligio rapture Para olvidar Los males de La Segunda Guerra Mundial y males sociales y politicos causados Por La misma y haciendo de Sus habitantes personas de hablidades fisicas y mentales Mucho Mas amplias calificado Como un Shooter de primera Persona tamBien Tiene un Toque de aventura y Survival Horror El juego comienza con un accidente de avion En Medio Del Oceano antes mencionado y siendo Los unicos sobrevivientes de este optamos Por buscar Refugio y Ayuda pasamos a La Entrada de Lo que parecer Ser un faro pero Al meternos descrubrimos Una esfera batisferas Es El Nombre correcto que nos dirige Hacia La Atlantida Moderna pero ya no Es Lo que Parece o Lo que Se suponia debia de Ser Donde Ahora Hay vias de Agua lunaticos rebelion y Ahora puneteros fantasmas ?no Es genial Vivir En rapture Hay solo Una Decision importante En El juego cosechar o salvar a Las pequenas Si eres alguien Puro y de Corazon de Oro ya Sabes que Hacer y Si eres de esos Diablos que quieren demasiado pode no digamos Mas y comienza a cosechar pero Cada accion Tiene Sus consecuencias Aunque ellas Siempre Se mantendran fieles pero El Final Feliz y verdadero Es Siempre El de ayudar a Los Demas Sus pros Son La Musica que sencillamente Es Maravillosa La animacion Aunque Sea un juego Del Ano 2007 Es adecuada a Su Epoca El juego Te Mete tension Por La atmosfera Obscura y gracias a Esto puedo probar que El argumento de que Es un Survival Horror Es cierto El Control de Las Armas Es bueno y Lo que Se Puede Hacer con Los plasmidos Es fenomenal de La misma manera puedes Tener aliados Como torretas camaras de Seguridad y Robots guardias que puedes hackear Para Lo Mismo tamBien puedes comprar municion que Es Algo sumamente bueno puesto que Si no La encuentras En El cadaver de un enemigo Lo puedes comprar y tenemos El Uso de Eve que sustituiria a Lo que vendria siendo La Magia Lo Malo Es El Final podria decir que Es Lo Unico Malo Aunque Muchos Se quejan de que Hay creditos despues Del Final a Mi me hubiera gustado verlos y aparte de que Aunque Sea El verdadero o El Malo Es un tanto Corto interesante pero Corto y Muchos otros valores que no Se explotan dentro Del juego Al Final ?que distingue a un Hombre Libre de un esclavo ?dinero ?poder no El Hombre compra Bioshock El esclavo Lo rechaza
10 10siendo continuacion de puzzle Agent nos deja satisfechos un Poco Mas de dificultad con Los acertijos de Principio y Al Final seguimos con La misma Historia En scoggins Minnesota El Lugar Donde desaparecio Isaac davner El cual continuamos buscando no Si antes toparnos con viejos y Nuevos personajes que tendran que Ver con Algo de La Historia de La misma manera La busqueda Por encontrar Al integrante de La Fabrica de Gomas de borras nos llevan Otra Vez con Las personas ocultas o gnomos Del Bosque En Esta divertida e ingeniosa secuela Del agente puzzle disfrutaras e investigaras Muchos datos a Fondo de Todo ten En cuenta que Ahora Tiene logors !aprovecha y algunos Son Muy faciles de conseguir cuidado con Los logros ocultos espero con ansias Una tercera Entrega !escuchanos telltale
increible juego de Survival Horror con tematica de zombis Aunque Son Llamados sombras con Gran jugabilidad 2d mientras tratas de evadir a Las hordas de sombras Lo que Pasa alrededor de Randall Tiene un Sinfin de acontecimientos que Si Bien algunos no tienen que Ver con El objetivo Es interesante saber un Poco de Los Demas Tiene Sus Momentos tragicos pues Te Vas a separando de Tus companeros Al inicio y tienes que Ir buscando a Los Demas a Lo Largo de Tu recorrido Por La Ciudad de Seattle Lo maravilloso de deadlight Es que nos hace sentir En un Mundo caotico con La Siempre necesidad de huir Aunque no Es Todo correr a La derecha o izquierda puedes Hacer parkour y de Plano Te encuentras con 2 o 3 Armas a Lo Largo Del juego requiere un Poco de estrategia Eso Si trata Bien de medir Tus actos antes de Hacer Una accion pues Todo conlleva a Otra Hay zombis Por Donde Te Lo imagines y Si no eres precavido pueden agarrarte unos 4 o 5 y ya valiste y a empezar Desde El Ultimo checkpoint Las situaciones En Las que Se encuentra En protagonista mediante avances Seran Cada Vez Mas complejas de igual manera Si huyes Sin mirar atras creyendo que Te has Salvado de Todo no Es Asi ya que Si quieres Tener Todos Los logros Todos todos deberas encontrar ciertos objetos Secreto que podrias estar dejando El Mismo Momento que trata de Echarte a Fuga composicion de La Banda sonora !fabulosa con Sus toques triste y pseudo euforicos En Los Momentos menos esperados Algo que Tal Vez no Remarque y deberia hacerlo Es La animacion de La cinematica Vaya sumamente fascinante El diseno de personajes y ambientacion Esta de pelos un Gran excelente y sobresaliente Trabajo Por parte de Tequila works espero Ver Su Proximo videojuego En este o algunos anos Mas Por este analisis Es suficiente Lo que Tengo que decir Si no piensas comprarte este juego lastima pues ya dije Todo Lo bueno que Tiene y alguno de Ello Te Tiene que llamar La atencion
hablar de Portal Es hablar de Lo Grande que puedes llegar con Una secuela y La Verdad Es que Creo que Tiene un Gran Impacto En jugabilidad diseno y Banda sonora que Va de acuerdo con La tematica Del juego Al agregar un Modo cooperativo Para Dos usuarios a traves de internet o a pantalla dividida En consolas Es La incorporacion Mas Notable y llamativa no obstante Esta no Debe distraernos Del Hecho de que Hay muchas novedades Mas y Tambien de enorme importancia La naraccion incluisicion de Nuevo personajes y resolucion de puzzles y La hablidad de Pensar Al Tener que Pasar Una Camara de pruebas o completar logros Lo cual Es bueno ya que no Es Tanta La variedad de Juegos que tengas rompecabezas En El y Mas aparte La Gran minoria Los compra Portal 2 comienza de forma espectacular Al inicio descubriremos que Nada Es Lo que Parece y que Lo que En Los instantes de apertura Parece Ser Una aventura En La que caminaremos solos rapidamente recibe un golpe de Suerte literal inesperados aliados y viejos conocidos Como Los enemigos La simpatia Del juego Se Gana debido a que Los dialogos que nos Dan Son doblados Al Espanol y con toques humoristicos bastante agradables El doblaje Del juego Es bastante bueno a Mi parecer encaja perfectamente con Los personajes recuerda buscar objetos ocultos Al finalizar Las camaras pues Puede que sirvan despues Para ayudarte a conseguir un logro y con El ya mencionado Modo cooperativo tienes un Sinfin de diversion con Amigos y siendo Muy estrategico mediante Ello Para terminar y dejarme de rodeos un juego que no Te puedes perder y Es necesaria Su compra creeme no Te arrepentiras
realmente un Gran juego Muy recomendable adictivo y quiza con ganas de Una Segunda Entrega he vuelto a steam y Lo primero que Busque Fue La actualizacion Del juego Aunque Al parecer Se Va a Tardar Algo de Tiempo Si Algo En fin mientras Uno espera Puede obtener Los animalitos completar El Modo Loco o jugar con Amigos Si Es que Ellos no Han terminado El juego Algo que igual de genial Es que puedes obtener a hatty hattintong Si compraste El battleblock Theater y Tambien Las animaciones Del Los jefes Al Ser un videojuego En 2d La animacion Es Perfecta
Metro catalogado Como Uno de Los mejores Juegos basados En libros y no Se equivocan realmente Muy bueno La tematica acerca de Una Guerra nuclear que Ha dejado un Mundo Post apocaliptico En Donde algunos de Los habitantes de Lo que antes Se conocia Como rusia Del Metro viven Como personales normales En Sus hogares apesar de Las pesadillas vivientes En La superficie Hasta que Una amenaza conocida Como Los oscuros acecha a Tu estacion Hogar Alli Es Donde Tu El protagonista Debes intervenir Para salvar Lo que queda de Tu ya deteriorada Morada El juego En Si cuenta con unas graficas Buenas Para Su Ano de estreno y Tambien Lo Mismo En cuanto a La Version Redux Se refiere La Musica y Ese Ambiente que hace querer Ver Bien Por Donde andas pues Puede estar oliendo Tu miedo Las criaturas de Las tierras altas La hace un Shooter y Survival Horror imposible de perder La variedad de Armas que encontraras sera Fantastica Desde Una simple revolver Hasta un Potente lanzallamas La opcion de ayudar o no a personas que a Lo Largo Del juego necesitaran Una Bala o un Pequeno favor tras ayudarte a avanzar En Tu Camino Hacia La Ciudad de polis pero no creas que no Te Dan Nada Por Eso Los puntos morales sirven Para acumular un secretito inclusive Dos finales diferentes que dependen de Si has cumplido con El antes mencionado sistema Moral podras Ver El Lado bueno de Las personas que En un Principio creias hostiles ?vale La Pena comprarse El juego Creo que de Lo Poco que he dicho Debe Ser Buena Razon Para comprarlo Estoy Seguro que Lo disfrutaras Tiene logros que Seguro Te Haran Pasar un rato o que Tal Vez cumplas a La mitad de La Historia algunos cuestan Trabajo pero puedes repetir capitulos Para completarlos Todos Puede Ser que Tenga Sus dificultades Como unos cuantos bugs que me encontre En La Mision chocera y a veces Puede crashearse pero Creo que no tendras problemas Si Por Lo menos Lo juegas En Una Pc de escritorio pero Si tienes Una computadora Gamer y deseas entretenerte Por Lo Maximo unas 25 horas Mas Lo acumulado con Los logros o 30 horas Es un juego que Te Va a dejar Encantado sobretodo con Los mensajes que Dejan algunos personajes Como Khan reitero no puedes perderte este juego traido de La mano de La Novela Metro_2033 de dmitry glukhovsky y El Equipo de 4a games Yo actualmente Estoy tratando de buscar La Obra de Arte Post apocaliptica de este joven Hombre
realmente un juego Muy bueno En Su Genero excelente animacion y Ese Estilo caricatura Del Senor annable Muy recomendable En Mi opinion Si Es que Te quieres Romper un rato El coco El juego Te Lo acabas Como En 2 horas Maximo Si Es que Sabes rompecabezas telltale no defrauda con este pedazo de maravilla Una Historia Muy atrapable con unos personajes un Poco raros vean a Bjorn Aunque Eso no Le Quita Lo divertido Una lastima que no Haya traducciones todavia En este juego Por Lo menos no de manera oficial Algo que deja pensando despues de terminarlo Es que Paso con El individuo accidentado oh Se me olvidaba mencionar que Los acertijos tampoco Son Tan complicados algunos Son sencillos y otros un tanto tediosos no Tengo Nada Mas que decir Al respecto Si no Te convence El precio no Se que Lo Hara Otra excelente aventura ttg !muy Buena
realmente fascinante Tener un juego de La Famosa trilogia Del Senor Spielberg Es increible ya Han Pasado varios meses Desde que Estamos En El Futuro y Seguro Marty querria que jugaramos Esto ya Saben Para detener Las paradojas temporales y regresar La linea Del Tiempo a Donde Debe de estar Los controles Son Buenos ?que puedo decir En esos Momentos telltale no Tenia Las mecanicas de Ahora con the walking Dead Aunque Los puzzles Se puedan resolver con Las pistas puedes hacerlo a La antiguita tratando con Todo Hasta Dar con Uno excelente Banda sonora me encanta sobretodo Porque ponen El tema Principal de Las cintas Aqui un juego que Aunque Puede Ser tedioso Al esperar a que cargue un Poco y Puede que sino Le entiendes Al ingles Te desespere un Poco merece La Pena tenerlo En La Biblioteca totalmente y Mas Si quieres recordar Sobre La ya con 30 anos lanzamiento trilogia temporal de Spielberg gracias steam y Larga Vida a tt games esperamos Mas Juegos suyos y con subtitulos En Espanol Por Lo menos
puedo decir Ahora que despues de terminar El juego Te quedas con ganas de Mas lamentablemente lucasart Fue Cerrado hace ya 2 anos pero Sus Buenos Juegos viviran En Los corazones de Muchos El Tipo de juego que Es grim Fandango Es aventura Grafica Como cualquier Otro de larts que Se Basa En La Fiesta tradicional Mexicana Dia de Los Muertos con un Toque de humor absurdo grafico En Ella de igual manera Se encuentran guinos a La Cultura Mexicana y Latina Como tenemos a un personaje inspiridado En Lo que Se Ve Al Che Guevara Salvador limones En Si El juego Narra Una Gran Historia con personajes variados y con un Buen Tono de Color Hasta Se ponen azules de La asfixia literalmente Tiene un buenisimo guion Es Muy extenso y elaborado de Tal manera que hace no parezca de relleno cierta situacion de Modo que Al Final Todo encaja perfectamente Al Ser La remasterizacion de Uno de Los primeros trabajos de Lucas arts En 3d y me Parece excelente que La llegada a La Plataforma de steam Haya sido un Exito con Hasta Su soundtrack En Venta hablando de soundtrack Es fascinate Tiene Jazz instrumentales Clasico romanticos y Le Da un Placer Al oido esuchar Tan sagradas Melodias compuestas Por Peter Mcconnell que dice Haber Ido a mexico Para poder realizar Su Banda sonora Si buscan un juego Para Pasar El rato y sacarle El Jugo a Los logros este Es Uno de Los Buenos compralo no Te arrepentiras Es un Hecho que Las avemturas graficas Son grandiosas Para abrir Tu Mente y hacerte Ver La Logica
excelente Historia personajes me Parece un Buen juego En Si Lo que Mas me encanta Es La referencia de diversos escritores En este juego y Por Si Fuera Poco El juego incluye El idioma En Espanol latino que Es Lo que me gustaria Ver En otros Juegos Mas no me Canso de jugar un Poco caro pero Vale La Pena comprarlo
why is the game download only 12gb or so yet the usage of disk Space is 64gb no Workshop mods either

Good game but a bit glitchy
no lag when using a Cell phone10 10
this game was developed by Isis
Worst assassin class i Ve Ever_Seen in my entire Life
Reason why i like this game because it s coop Dem mods coach and Zoey death scream using vocalize Ofc Zoey is sexy Af bloods bloods and more bloods do u guys know about the Grenade_Launcher glitch you can Goomba Stomp the zombies wow Molotovs can bounce off the wallReason why i hate this game stupid bots can t revive someone while playing on campaign the bots is hacking while playing infected on versus infinite ammo on pistol too Ez and not realistic sometimes there is 2 3 tanks spawns on valve servers not in the the sacrifice Map 9 11 10 this game is Fun Af

Best game i have Ever_Played on steam i Play this evryday now even sneak on just to Play it i Rate it 20 10
my hours Help i wrote something for real these hours are legit i played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real Life i was Young and didn t really have my Gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and i had a really Bad Pc which i still own Tf2 was one of the games i could Play pretty well on this Pc but with horrid graphics but it was one of the more Fun games i installed i Met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side The_Community back then was more Humble compared to nowadays you have competitive gamers who Spam their bind Keys with unfunny Gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to Win the game when really it doesn t even matter if you Win or lose however you also have those people who are really awesome and you may Meet some nice friends along the Way although you never know what kinda Person you re going to Meet on this game in my honest opinion if you want to have a game to just Waste time on and money or just mess around with people you know which is what i do now this is perfect esspecially the Mann Vs machine co Op i mainly Play that now although to me the game lost its Touch Update Wise and i moved onto other games i believe it s Worth a shot to Try it out but other than that i d keep it as a casual game i don t think the competitive Scene is Worth getting into anymore because it s being flooded by crude people atleast from my experiance after over about 2 years of playing it just Got worse and worse you will eventually be tied into drama even if you Try to avoid it you Ll be more stressed than actually having Fun i Ll tell you that although in all seriousness this game is losing its Touch and probably Isn t Worth making it your Main game mainly because the updates they Ve been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be but it s a great game to just Play to Pass the time and have Fun all you Ll really Notice nowdays is people really love to Trade More_Than actually Play Living off as a Free to Play would be very tough and you d need to be patient with items you would want unless you Got that money Hope this helps one last thing i am not saying this game is Bad in any Way i am saying that it s Worth trying and playing with friends or even meeting people although there are some downsides that you Won t like such as some stuff i pointed out above strictly towards The_Community i personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your Come home to Play Sorta thing have it as a once in a while game because it s nothing to be Big about unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there just give it a shot and see what you think have Fun
nice
Team_Fortress_2 un excelente juego first Person Shooter con Estilo animado En Le Moto grafico Tiene Una Gran variedad de clases y Armas Desde Algunas ya conocidas Como Sniper medico ingeniero y otras creadas y Muy originales Como Spy Pyro y Soldier En otros Juegos Se Las Puede reconocer con otros nombres y otros tipos de Armas pero Aqui Cada Clase Tiene Su propio Estilo y Modo de juego Es gratis y utiliza El Motor source Visto En otros Juegos de valve Como Counter strike source no more Room in hell o Half_Life_2 este juego Lo recomiendo Porque entretiene Mucho En Los tiempos libres y En El Caso de que no tengas Conexion a internet En El Momento puedes jugar con Los bots En diferentes dificultades que cambien Su Modo de juego gracias a La excelente i a inteligencia artificial
Ce jeu est Fantastique aucun probleme Avec je pourrais Passer Des annees a tout Explorer En plus de Cela il est sublime

the game is really Good but when you are in the game for some time most of the terrain gets destroys making it harder to Play and sneak around which also leads you to Fall down holes also when you snipe it makes a Laser when you scope the game however is very creative and allows you to Create_Your_Own maps which is very Hard but also Fun because you can then make it together with your friends
Good game but keep getting disconnected from Multiplayer pretty Good

i built a beautiful City where problems where near Non_Existent but then we expanded Bringing industry and demand to skylines City that s where we Fell the Water supply was contaminated by Sewage the City was ravaged by crime and our factories Fell to Fires and above all unemployment then i figured well Skyline City is screwed then i restarted do i recommend this game that pays attention to detail seems as realistic as City builders get and is stunning in terms of what you can make what do you think of Course i do

Sweet game the customization is like photoshop heaps of Fun with friends or no friends
downloaded it Got a couple of kills used an airstrike thought i might get some kills with it killed not one Single enemy somehow killed myself uninstalled it and thought thank God i didnt Buy this game
nan
this game is the Reason i Got interested in history although this game Isn t historically accurate this game has great Variety in it s Gameplay and always puts up a Worthy Challenge every game you Play without getting repetative whenever i Play this game i cherish the fact that the most peaceful Person in the Modern World advicates his philosophy of peace and love by dropping nukes onto his enemies my verdict get this game although the large Price Sum it s a well Worth game
vv is a very retro platformer with the Core idea of Easy to Play difficult to Master the Controls are relatively simple left and right to move and either Space or x to reverse gravity but it allowed for surprisingly Complex Gameplay the levels were very thoughtfully designed and i always knew how to complete them although i have to admit i almost tried to pull my hair out at Certain points in the game especially for those seemingly unobtainable trinkets but i Thoroughly enjoyed this game and definitely reccommend it to others except if you re prone to rage quiting because New keyboards are expensive nowadays
omg perfect
Parece RIRE so q em Terceira pessoas Pra min e Bom
nice game
x3
nan
deberian sacar este juego de La Galeria de steam no Hay Nadie jugandolo
Muy recomendado Tiene Sus errores pero Tiene Una Historia bastante Buena y variada Claro Hay que Tomar deciciones Maso menos correctas y convenientes Para seguir con El juego Una Cosa Una Vez matas a algun npc que Te de Una Mision Creo Por Lo que Juge no puedes seguir parte de La Historia Si este era importante Para desbloquear parte de La misma Es un juego Viejo pero Tiene Como defenderse El pve Es un Poco dinamico pero suficiente Como Para derribar a Tus enemigos o que Te derriben Si Te rodean o realizas un Paso En falso
bastante divertido El juego Aunque En El co Op no Hay Mucha Gente

this f Ing game is the the Best game of all tyme
i do not recommend this game to people who have Low end Pcs because it is not optimized at all
what can i say about borderlands epicc seriously if u have never played it grab the goty Edition u will not be dissapointed
borderlands 2 is an awesome addition to the borderlands games there is so much to do i highly reccomend getting the goty Edition great Value for money only downside is the dlc s are very short nothing like the borderlands 1
payday 2 i an Improvement on the first but once u unlock all guns and masks getting to Level 100 is just a grind
Metro last light is an Improvement on the first has an excellent Story game Play and graphics really Good game highly reccomend
awesome game definitely Buy it as soon as u can well Worth it and amazing graphics and Gameplay if familar with Bioshock 1 and 2
awesome game but not like previous Max Payne games but relly Good would recommend to anyone
Best fps out there
this game is amazing i love it and i recommend it to anyone with a faint Heart
just awesome
well maybe this not have the Best qualities maybe this is not perfect maybe this is not completely f2p but i Play with a couple of friends and we Laugh while Play this game Flying corpses guys with Rocket launchers headshots campers building guys who build his own Base to Camp this game is Terrible but it s funny and i like that
awesome game like Dayz but more difficulty at the starti recommend this game simple view look like Minecraft but when you Play you Discover a epic game
Best game ever Rainbow tracks get Fisch s House number after finishing campaign and there s campaign goty then out of ten 10 10
some Guy sniped me with a Ak 47 from 100m away so i then killed him with my pistol he yelled at me and called me a hacker Counter strike in a nutshell
in Genral i think the game is one of the Beast of the theard Person shoters and you shoud harey up and add cratying a Custom game plz Harry

nice Bad heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit game
it s a pretty decent game with Good Gameplay and future possibilities this is like the Dayz with Mc graphics the Gameplay is solid and even though it doesn t really have a lot of maps yet i m looking Forward to seeing Big things for this game
don t download this game it will i repeat it will suck all your time with it s solid Gameplay great graphics and nice Story line every Mission felt like a Star Trek episode which is a plus seeing you could do what they can t do in the show download it if you want a boredom Killer for a long time trekies would feel at home
Es adictivo RIRE
Best game ever created so happy i bought it with all of the dlc s
amazing game and very realistic but i really wish they made it so when you bail you can Play as Infantry but only one Person and still be Able to Play but not kill anything except other Infantry

this is Tf2 its Fun and Good to Play
it s a great Smash_Bros alternative for the Pc and Free
this game is cool it has a vast Variety of items Weapons loot Gear and Armour Easy to get into for New players to the sandbox crafter genre and veterans of Minecraft will enjoy the fresh New diversity
there seem to be a lot of negative reviews of this game so let me put in my two Cents when i first saw this game in the steam Store it looked like a wallrunning Ninja tps Hybrid and when i downloaded and played it that is exactly what i received i was also pleasantly surprised by the 4player co Op option and the the campaign doesn t start off fantastic i hear it gets fairly Good and playing with three friends always makes things more Fun the game also has Pay to Win and mmo elements mmo elements like friends lists pms and the option to make a Clan add something nice to the game i found the Pay to Win Esque nature of the game wasn t a Deal_Breaker for me because it s more like Pay to Advance faster without paying a Single cent you can exceed at the game by skill alone easily the other thing is game progression meaning players who have spent longer on the game will have Better Gear than you and a few Extra abilities however this does not put them at an extreme advantage and is balanced nicely on my first game i was Able to get a nice amount of frags even though i was a beginner in terms of Gear the Best Gear is only slightly Better than the defalut stuff with upgrades being slight this means that no matter what you still need skill to Win not money a player with the Best Gear will still easily be poned by a more skilled player i think this game s a lot of Fun because of the Ninja like elements to it with the Wall running the variance in the classes and because of a lot of the unique Gameplay aspects in it being Able to switch Weapons quickly means that a lot of the time you will be most efficient in using your entire aresenal agains an opponent like switching from Close range to Mid range quickly to retreat from a Flamethrower or as a Sniper dashing back quickly from an approaching assailant with a Sword to then quickly Pull_Out your own Sword and Dash Forward to catch them off Guard i like that you can use Weapons while dashing and wallrunning meaning i can Dash sideways to avoid a Sniper and then quickly Run across the Wall towards him firing my smg while jumping from Wall to Wall to avoid his fire then Dash to the side onto a pillar then Change to my Sword while running in a spiral around that pillar so he can t keep Track of me then Dash behind him and finish him off with the Sword there are breast Physics as some have so crudely fixated on but unless you are swinging around character models in the Lobby they don t distract from Gameplay also when characters with skirts die sometimes they Ragdoll into some compromising positions but again it s Easy to either ingore or fixate on depending on your attittude so in short i really love the Gameplay i love the Way it blends long Mid and closerange i love how Fast paced it is i love the ability to form my own Clan or get tegether a team line up with my friends and together Wreak_Havoc Online i love fealing like a Ninja when i Drop_Off a chandelier to take down an unsuspecting enemy i love the split second reactions in just the Sword Play alone and i love that there is a whole gamemode dedicated to this personally i recomend this game it s Fun and it s Free
Dang it why did i let myself get fooled by the Trailer i really wanted to like this game i really did and it looks so Good in the Trailer lightsabers Mechs dinosaurs sounds like a recipe for Fun unfortunately tons of velociraptors in your Face that instantly blur because the textures blow isnt Fun guns that have a muzzle flash after you fire isnt Fun no tutorial what so ever isnt Fun microtransactions arent Fun and Gameplay elements that are Terrible i gave up playing as a velociraptor in thirty seconds because you cant strafe so the only thing to do to a Human is Run right at them no Way to out manouver and considering the humans can kill you in two seconds even as a Human the game felt Grindy and unpolished you can unload tons of ammo into the larger dinosaurs and get no results and not even anything to let you know they are taking damage apart from some out of place looking numbers on the screen and a Bad looking Blood Splatter now i don t usually Care if graphics are Bad but i want my bulltes to line up with my fire i want to not be the wrong Colour and have no textures for three seconds after spawning i want what feels like a complete game for my money at this tage i have to recomend you save yourself tha embarassment of trusting this game to deliver edit Ok they have recently made an Update that seems to follow a particular theme that theme is that the Devs are doing what they can to provide continual suuport adn are constantly improving the game basically all the issues i covered here Have_Been fixed so the game is Ok now
love it
a brilliant game with a brilliant Story
Evil but satisfying
not so sure on this game yes i enjoyed playing it but in my mind glithes are only funny if they are out of place whereas this markets itself as being full of bugs so you go in expecting to find them if you havent played it then i would recomend picking this up while its on sale
e legal so que trava muito Nao recomendo Para computadores de Puca Memoria
sprayed my entire Ak clip into a Guy and then he turned around and 1 shot me with a pistol 10 10 would spray and die again
there is a Poop Button RIRE i grunt when i Poop when i Poop i Level up i can Poop in other peoples Homes i can use my Poop for various other purposes the dinosaurs also Poop you can use their Poop as well greatest game ever 420 10 would Poop again
if you want to scream and behead lots of people this is the game for you 10 10

if this game was a chick i d Bang her 10 10 Best game ever
when you Stop playing Cs go and Cod for Weeks for a game that was only 15 you know its Good
one of the Best game i have even played Single player is so cool how u can build about anything and the mutiplayer wow were do i begin so many Fun games and things u can do
its a great game or is it
its awesome but im Poor so i cant getr it
Best game ever
i havent played the binding of Isaac rebirth for too long but i can safely say that in the time i have played ikt i have enjoyed it immensly it is a dungoen Crawler that is randomly generated each time you load up a game which means almost infinite contect for the players i wasnt expecting much before getting this game but it has unlockable characters and a few more things to Aim for plus it has a item drop system in which it doesnt tell you what the items do so you have to figure it out yourself but of Course you can search the Wiki if you need too everytime you Play there is a Different experience awaiting the experience generally ends up being pretty hectic i 100 recommend this game to all gamers its well Worth the money and the Value for your dollar is great get this game now
this game is highly recommended for antisocial Rats and Social Kings you can Sit in a sandbox game alone for hours on end and not get bored or you can Play one of the multitudes of gamemodes such as trouble in terrorist Town tt if you want to have a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit of Fun get this game
Fun and enjoyable has an amazing soundtrack and a pretty Good Story Tommy the Main protaganist isnt all that likable well to me he isnt but it doesnt really take away from the overall experience with the game although i have had some problems with the frame Rate and some Controls not working when you Turn_Off the frame Limiter if you can deal with those small problems then it is definetely Worth a Buy in my opinion if you have are used to a smooth 60 fps on all your games and you dont think you could handle your frames being limitied to 30 fps and a Fair bit of stuttering every now and then i dont reccomend that you get this game but if there was one piont of Vice City that i would like to Push on you it is the soundtrack it is great and there is a Radio Station for pretty much everyone but if you are after that 1980s miami Vibe i would suggest emotion so once again if you arent too bothered with not having a flawless and mooth experience get this game but if you are one of the few that could not handle even looking at a game unless it is running at a buttery 60 fps i suggest you to give this game a shot it really is great and if you dont like it its not much money wasted its gta Vice City after all
great game with an amazing Community the Learning curve if you are just getting into the game is pretty Steep but once you get the Hang of the Mechanics everything will feel like second nature to you i urge anybody who doesnt have this game to get it because you are missing out on a great Gaming experience and arguably the Best Community on steam

heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit you game
amazing game while borderlands 2 has the Edge on the first in terms of Story and dynamics borderlands has some great aspects that the sequel lacks the visuals and soundtrack combine for a realistic and unique atmosphere while there are clever moments of humour littered throughout the game one of the Best parts is the Multiplayer as you can Play through the entire Story including side quests with up to three friends how cool right would totally recommend
Better with friends but still heaps of Fun
Dayz Minecraft roblox so cool but i want more servers

gret game 10 10
Best Combat game on steam
from the very little time that i have played i have loved it so Far the 3d World is amazing and i would recommend this game to anyone with a Passion for detailed artwork
this is a great game to be played the Weapons are well made and its not a Pay to Win kinda game the after death quotes are very funny but the only Bad thing is that there isnt alot of people playing this a great fps for everyone to enjoy
great emotional movie probably the Best movie on games one can easily connect to the professional players Life and feel sympathy towards them one could feel the anticipation of every move in the game each of the players sacrifice so much for what they loved most Dota i Rate this movie 10 10last of all one does not simply Beat dendi solo Mid
massively addictive i Play this for hours on end just trying to find each combination
Warning before looking at this game this game is designed for a specific type of persononly get it if you enjoy metroidvania games this game is extremely difficult and you should at least watch a small bit of Gameplay to see if you will enjoy it or not but without further Ado lets begin the reviewthe Good pros varied Weapon choices a boomerang a throwing Axe a Bow and several swords many refeerences Zelda Castlevania Metroid Mario just for a few examples often save points you Ll be saving many many times very Hard there s an achivement for dieing 500 times even Easter Eggs galore amazing art Style tight controlsthe Bad cons once again difficulty no obvious Map leading to consult a Guide which there is only one i can find can access the later areas of the game at the very start one Hit death Spikes nearly everywhere in the game fps drops during Certain bosses 60fps to 20fps unlike other games this relies on Pixel perfect platforming sometimes and even a normal enemy can lagg the game and this Isn t just my laptop as i have seen this as a common Problem Level up your Knight with wildly Different abilities you can switch Armour Magic and Weapon and the Magic is the thing that you will need to switch should you Buy this as i said if this looks Fun and you can endure Hard platforming battles etc then go ahead and Buy it if not then look Somewhere_Else but i reccomend it
introi don t really have anything to put here RIRE i just thought i should put something here before starting the Review storywithout giving too much away the game starts with you getting shot in the Head after Waking_Up you enter the first Town and begin your trip most of the lore is in vaults and other assorted adbandoned places at a Certain PoInt the game allows you a selection of four Different storylines that you can choose from gameplayas it is in Fallout 3 the game is still an fps and plays like other rpg fpss from the past Generation with 5 primary Weapon types guns Energy Weapons melee unarmed and explosives you can easily Change up your Play Style or even do a pacifist Run character customisationoh man where to start beginning with purely Cosmetic changes there are probably a couple hundred Different character customisations you can make going into more Gameplay Style changes s p e c i a l stats reappear in this game as for those of you that have never played or seen a Fallout game before s p e c i a l Stands for strength perception endurance Charisma Intelligence agility and Luck i m not going to go over what they are used for as you can probably easily search it or find a Guide there are also about 10 or so Minor skills that i m not going to go over here as this Review is long enough as it is next there are perks that you can Select every even Level 2 4 6 8 10 etc for those that aren t bothered remembering what the even numbers are that you can use for Bonus skills such as Bonus Gun damage lastly as is pretty obvious you can freely Change all your Equipment and Weapons at will musicmost if not all of the music is older stuff but i appreciate it anyway the music is fitting enough with the game s tone being Old 19 somethings music the negativethe Worst part about this game is just the amount of bugs you can encounter i don t know if my laptop is weird or something but i Ve only experienced 2 crashes aside from that there is practically nothing that i have bugs with if you have played Fallout 3 or seen footage of either that or this and it looks like a game you would Play pick it up if it doesn t interest you then you most likely Won t enjoy it overall thoughtsfirstly keeping in mind i skimmed over the dlc and companions and sorts the game is quite expansive i Ve spent 33 hours on it already and im not even up to 40 of the Way complete from this i give the game a 9 10 from the very few bugs that i Ve encountered
this is amazing but you should probably get this only if you have spare money not Worth prioritizinga short Video i did on the game https Ww youtube Com watch v 6hok64artgc
this game is hilarious with many references to anime and other videogames the game has 4 chapters each with 4 levels the game also comes with an endless Mode which has every Single Level endlessly repeating the Bonus modes are hilarious and the game has a Free dlc Mode in which people can upload Their_Own levels made with the Level Creator in which you get from getting Gold in every scenario in chapter 1 the game is Essentially endless for 5 00 and one of my Favourite steam games
such a Fun game New Missions being released frequently so you don t have to keep playing the same Ones Buy ehhtt
still the moSt stable benchmark i Ve found for pushing my Equipment to its Max then knocking it back down a bit so it s also stave in badly optimised games highly recommend even for testing stability in basic systems and New hdds Ram cpu changes
so many Different cultures take for instance the russians after about 20 minutes you Ll be drunk on vodka playing Russian_Roulette with 6 bullets all considered a solid 8 10
if you have three willing friends thank God and then all get the game if you have two willing friends Pray to God that one of them Dosen t leave a quater of the Way through your Journey Ben then get this game if you have atleast one willing Friend devote your Life to God and get this game it is one of the Best games i have Ever_Played also if you don t have any friends i m sure you will have some Fun
this game is so Freakin awesome it has great Gameplay lots of Fun modes and great classes 9 10
there issomething wrong with my game when i Try to Play it says directx 11 initialize error i would like it if someone tld me how to fix this since im really looking Forward to playing this game
Best Cod ever
no just no
Op game
pretty Good game requires a lot of traning and Practice to become Good though
awesome
simple but Genuis
this game is freaking awsome it like battelfield 2142 but with massively Multiplayer and it Better the game like real Life War it very Easy to die in the battlefield and Friendly fire always on even my Favorite class is Sniper but it extremely difficult to kill a Target also this game is great for everyone like to explode the World this is the Best teamwork game ever but that was the Good part now here the Bad one it Hard to get money in a ridiculous Way everyday i Play planetside 2 it just give me like 10 30 Cert but meanwhile the money needed to Buy a Weapon was like 10k 20k i was like wtf and if you want to get more money is to become a memeber but it like 2 months for 1 according to my memories well that it for a vietnamese 13 years Old boy so overall i recommend this game well done Mr planetside 2 Hope you will have more Greater Update in the future thanks you
i Ve played this game since the 1 0 0 Update lot of Update Has_Been made but it keep Better and Better this game is mind blowing Best game ever 11 10
awsome very Good Graphic Fast time to download very Easy to Play
this game is amazing it has so much content and it has the Concept of skill and mastery it also Offers_Unique skins to add on your Weapons that don t have an affect on the game
ultimately addictive game that is Fun in every possible Way by Far the Best Free to Play game there is and also arguably one of the top games ever created 15 10
to write this Review i m going to be using nothing but quotes from the game itself game Dev and simulation is a great combination they achieved a great Balance between Technology and design my New Favourite one of the Best 8 10 kthxbai

Good Free game probably the Best Free game ive played yet definately recommend it
super hexagon is a Fun but frustrating game that is guaranteed to test your reflexes the game includes 6 levels now i now you might think you Ll finish the game right away but Trust me i Ve played for about one and a half hours and i still Haven t finished the first Level but one Day in General super hexagon is a challenging Fast paced game that will have you concentrating so Hard that you Ll feel as if you re brain will just suddenly explode into a Flaming Ball of fire so if you want a game that will give you many many hours of concentration and dizziness this game is perfect for you
when i say this i mean it goat Simulator is the Best game in the entire World goat Simulator is a game which i don t think needs that much explanation the game is an all around mayhem machine which gives the player Freedom and laughter this is actually the most Random game i have Ever_Played i woud recommend this game to every Single Person i know this game makes Flying Giraffes exploding goats and freefalling ostriches a part of everyday Life although the bug Count is infinitely High they contributed to the games hilarity and the players enjoyment if you don t have this game yet get it now i have never had this much Fun in a game before i give this game a 10 10
assassins Creed Ii is a great game with a gripping storyline and exellent Mechanics that really do make you feel like a classic awesome assassin this game is so much Fun to Play the game has the ability to grab you and take you into a World full of assassins and betrayal this game is excellent but there are a couple of downsides the tutorials are next to pointless it is impossible to instantly know which Button to Press when it tells you to because they don t tell you which Key to Press just a symbol representing it which i found irritating and pointless i also believe that this game really should Ve included steam achievments and trading Cards there is something about some games that when you complete a difficult Challenge or Play for a couple of hours you feel you deserver some sort of reward to sow your friends your acomplishments but maybe that s just me apart from these setbacks i am Thoroughly enjoying this game and i can not Wait to find out what happens next
Saints Row Iv is the Best game i Ve Ever_Played although the Story can be a Little_Bit repetitive this game gives you the power to do whatever you want whether that s using the Force to pick people up and throw them to the Moon going on an Alien killing rampage with a giant d ldo bat or simply Flying around the Alien infested simulation of steelport as the game progress you unlock more super Powers that make you feel like even more of a Badass than you were before this game is my Favourite game of all time
omg Saints Row the third is Crazy awesome this game makes Old homeless people going on a d ldo bat rampage completely normal in Saints Row you almost have the ability to do whatever you want whether thats jumping off a skyscraper naked beating up a Cop with a d ldo or just trolling your friends in Online co Op this game is absolutely amazing
Garry s Mod is an awesome sandbox which gives you the ability to do anything like slingshot cars across the sky Ragdoll payday 2 members around or attach Deadpool to your car and Drive of a Cliff just a couple of the things i Ve done if you don t have this game yet you re missing out on so much this game is awesome
game Dev tycoon is a Truly satisfying and enjoyable game which has Taken_Away countless hours of my Life no regrets this game centres around you a beginning game develpoer during the start of Video games you start to build up your company until you have either grown a massively successful game company or gone completely bankrupt the game has you make games and see how critics and the Public react to your game if all goes well you will earn money if they hate the game then you Won t be profiting to much from that particular game when you get a perfect 10 10 game it is the greatest feeling in the World the only downside is if you have a series of unsuccessful games and you go bankrupt which makes you either start over or go back to when you first moved into a New building a Feature of the game all in all i think this game is a great game which is almost impossible to Master and is a great strategy game filled with satisfaction and enjoyment 9 5 10
Hitman_Absolution is a fantastically Fun game which makes you feel like a stealthy murdering Ninja in a suit and i don t know what could make you feel like a bigger Badass than playing as the Infamous hitman although everyone is saying that this game Isn t Worth the Price because it doesn t Count as a hitman game i bought it anyway and i m very happy with my Decision i don t understand what all of the fuss is over this game it s still hitman Bald Badass going in like a Ninja to eliminate his Target in Style just because the game took a Different Approach doesn t mean the series Has_Been ruined the features to this game give you the feeling that if you bring out your Infamous silenced silverballers it s impossible for you to Miss the Head of your Target the game gives you a great amount of creativity on how to eliminate you targets you could choke him when no one s looking make the kill look like an Accident or just go all out shooting everyone in sight overall this game is a brilliant game with excellent Mechanics that make you feel like the invisable ghost you are
bit trip Fate is a game that honestly made me really angry that i paid 1 for this game even though i Got this game while it was on sale i still can not begin to describe how this game irritated me first off the game is ever so pointless making you feel like every second you spend playing it is just time you Ll never get back two the game looks lousy i Ve played many Pixel games that i Ve enjoyed but the pixelation was done so badly that i couldn t even tell what was going on overall i found this game nothing More_Than a pain if this game ever goes on sale stay as Far away as possible

a really nice game if you want to Play a realistic tactic Shooter Arma 3 is the Way to go the Best thing about Arma 3 is creating your Mission and almost create any sore of gamemode to be played by yourself or with Someone_Else of maybe even a server one of the Best gamemodes everyone shuold Try if you get the game is atlis Life which is a roleplay gamemode i played over 100 hours plus of it and that show how much i love this game most of the time i would be playing with my mates or people i Meet in game i would recommend to Play this game with at least one Friend
i would have to give this a game 10 10 because i Got my moneys Worth and can not say it is Bad in anyway i have almost played 500 hours of Garry Mod if you are into building or anything like that this game is for you the Reason i like this game is about you can almost create anything you can think of and that you can Play this game with a mate and get some of the Best times out of this game a gamemode i think everyone should Try is darkrp darkrp is a roleplaying gamemode that allows you to take Garry s Mod to the next Level such as using Gun drugs houses jobs cops rebels and just about everything you can think of in real Life you can just about do in this game i Got to say if you enjoy Minecraft and it is boring now then this is the next game you should Buy and give a go
exelente juego

great game Way Better that borderlands 1 Better guns and Better game Play and Better campaign exilent dlc and the dlc classes are just Devine the art Work is amazing and its just over all Fun i Got it for 16 but its well Worth 100 but all the dlcs are over priced i think like seriously 15 for a Extra class i mean that is redicluas but its is one Ov my favourats so i think it desurvs a 10 10 and the Extra missons are Fun as well its not like go kill this thing or go here and talk to this Person its like 3 4 missons long and the Work of Pandora ajusts to what you do in the campaign and its one of those games that have a long and really i mean really Fun campaign an its one of those game what you Play in front of a Bowl of Chips and beer with a whole bunch of mates getting stoned and drunk that is the borderlands 2 Life
great game 10 10 but the thing is its great Better than 4 Better graphics mean Story and two endings but one heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit s up 4 s first Misson
it want s you to sighn up to a scoial Club and then Crash s or does not start and no matter how much you Tube Video s to fix this Problem nothing works im on Windows 8 and it does not Work so i dont recomend but it does look Good but have never played once i Got up to the tital screen clicked Play and it crashed i want my money back and it is just not Good enof like i said im on Windows 8 and if you want to give me a sulution Pls respond to this and send me a steam message and everyone that i asked hade the Problem they said reinstall so i did and nothing happend just the same thig
great game and really Good missons and lots of them to it is jut endles Fun a Tun of guns and i like when you first start you get a Weapon not like borderlands 2 to Good really Good game one of my favorats 10 10
most heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Saints Row game i think the third is the Best in my opinion like its a crap Story and the third has Better Story graphics guns bosses fights its just all Round Better
very Good but laggy
Forgive_Me if i did anything wrong cuz this is my first time writing a Review some people say that this game is Pay 2 Win but Trust me you can still survive without paying with real money all you need is teamwork the guns doesn t have that much difference except the firing speed and Control its quite complicated if your New to third Person Cover shooters but as you progress it Ll be Easy to get killstreaks you also Buy your grenades so you Won t see people spamming grenades like Crazy also this game has some cool abilities exclusive to each class you can fry your enemies with your Mini u f o thing or you can Scan where your enemies are through an opaque things like walls or cars sadly you can t peek through their clothes im just joking you can also put a Shield around you so that you can go out in the Open without taking a Bullet in the Face overall this game has alot of potential you should definitely Try it and a little Tip mystery Boxes have some cool or poopy loot in them so if you want to Gamble and you have money not real World money to spare Try to Buy a couple of them
one of the Best Free to Play western Shooter game its simple its Fun and who would not like to blow people up with dynamites message to server makers Pls make more servers for this gamemessage to Devs of this game Pls Nerf voices like Pass the Whiskey message to readers and Fellow players Pass the Whiskey

very Fun and challenging game shows of ww1 and its brutality why has no one tried games like this before attacking defending and Holding trenches which Btw is very Hard unless your team works together if you like Tactical shooters that punish Poor decisions this is for you your team is divided into4 man squads of slightly varied Equipment teamwork is vital putting Aa games to Shame with 4 Free dlc s under Development smaller Aussie Community but there is always a couple of matches going with Good connection i really wish this game had a larger Aussie Community but haVe had no issues thus Far to all those who served in ww1 lest we forget
my Quest Has_Been simple to gain every strippers Mobile number would question Life decisions leading to these moments again 11 10
rename this game to fifa 16 pros more Realism then fifa no Ultimate team can t Park the Bus cons everytime i go to Play this game for 10 mins i quit 2 hours later
Early access Review 06 07 15 will be updating as the game progresses Ark is your typical Survival crafting building game but has a character levelling rpg element to it this game as of right now does require Work optimazation especially i personally have not had many issues atall i Have_Been running this game on medium settings and it does lag from time to time what you do have so Far is a solid Foundation of a game to build upon all the Standard crafting and building elements plus there is dinosaurss maybe im too hyped from seeing jurassic World too many times already who knows this game has massive potential that is all well and Good i have the potential to be a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing genius but the odds of that actually happening we all will just have to see what the developers end up doing will they build upon a solid Base or take everyones cashand dissappear to the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing Moon watch this Space from what i have played so Far i genuinly have enjoyed myself if you like crafting building Survival and dinosaurs maybe give it a go or Play it Safe and Wait a Month or so to see how its going
Alpha 0 02 Review game has many bugs that lead to death but Core Gameplay is quite addictive has heaps of potentiAl and is Soo damn Fun exploration plus building plus cannibAl butchering
this game is for those who are after a Challenge and none of this arcade killstreak heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t year after year for those who love teamwork get it for those who love ww2 themed games Buy it has some pretty damn Good immersion first game i played i saw a Guy Hold a grenade too long blowing both his Arms offand killing 3 squadmates while taking Cover the Gore was tops tatical Shooter at its finest first Play session i had Online was 4 hours without realising great game 10 10
if only more Health was added so you dont die as soon as u Reach ur destination half Way across the Map but over all it is a Good game and i like it
i would recommend this game for people that like unique Play Style
this game is one of the Best Indie games that i have played in a while exellent Gameplay music and design
once a game amongst legends now relegated to compete with call of Duty infinite warfare as the biggest jokes in Gaming for 2016 edit servers are now infested with hackers since valve took away our ability to kick people 10 10 would not recommend this game as of this edit
its a great game for Action lovers its also like gta
poorly optimized crap Run at 40 fps on gtx 760 4 Gb on lowest setting and stutter every 1 second
Better than Cod ghost
this game is really awesome the realistic Gameplay the Graphic the classes and the weaponry is really great
the campaign in this game is actually Fun i have to admit the Story is actually great but this game have a lack of Performance i get stutter alot on my gtx 760 which is the recommended Graphic Card and i have to lower all of the setting to medium Low to make the stutter less noticeable that doesn t mean the stutter gone and some host Problem i always get into 800 ping matches and some time i Got into a modded Lobby and get my Rank resetted which is frustating
Bang her for those that have played chpater 4 p

muito top joguei Por horas
this is an excellent game i definitely recommend itpros the Combat sytem great and works for many Different Play styles nice smooth movements and such well made Level up system great Community Good graphics Good Old time Weapons it s Free to Play and the game is still extremely enjoyable if you don t Buy extras using real moneycons some battles can be over challenging an example is where i was shoved on a team by myself for some Reason and had to fight off 5 enemies this of Course hasn t happend since tanks are fairly Hard to Defeat and or Control making money is slow ishnotes there is a bit of lag but it s nothing too serious it is occasionally annoying but still doesn t affect you much it s also understandable considering the size of the maps number of player and other contributing factors so Yeh it s a great game so Play it now
this is jusrt a all around great game and i love the Price and all the mods all around 5 5
i hate it because there are heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing trolls

awesome game so much Fun would sell my mom for a Knife
Dota one of the Best games ever at times can Help relax but also it has its downfalls such as ruining relationships with your Family and other acquaintances anyway keep calm and Play Dota
half Life the game that started it all even though it was made back in 1998 it is still a Gem i don t vote games by their graphics but by their Gameplay this was an immersing wonderful and addicting experience for me i lived another Life in this game the game has everything a Gamer asks for immersing Gameplay indulging Story a nice selection of Weapons and graphics that were thrilling in the year it was made but are all Old now even now this title Holds up till today shining its glory as the first game that valve ever made and a game that changed Gaming itself now i will have a look at the Main aspects of a Good game Warning a Little_Bit of spoiling ahead Gameplay excellent either you are blasting monsters from an alternate dimension or just trying to pick off those squad men who just don t seem to put you in peace there were a few places where it did get a Little_Bit boring but that was because i couldn t Wait until i would experience something New the terrain in the game is nicely made even though it is pretty Old due to the date it was made the places you travel through are pretty Different you Won t be bored of seeing the same Old place over and over again the game itself is nicely balanced except that they could have put less ammo in the game so you wouldn t always have a Gun loaded 9 10story a nice Story is told throughout the game and that is guaranteed to keep you hooked until the last moment of the game even though it doesn t have any cutscenes it tells its Story just wonderfully it keeps you in first Person Mode all of the time so it makes you live the character all the Way through the Story all the stuff that is happening in the game seems kind of logical as if Could_Happen in real Life the characters are well done as well for they Act as normal people would Act they are as they should be they speak fight Help you and do other stuff and there is a wierdly acting character which Stands out in the game but i will let you figure that out for yourself there aren t the same scientists all over and over again but we can t say this with Security guards the enemies are widely assorted and Won t make you think that they are dumb but Play as they are real and trying to get you no dull moment will get you in this game so don t Be_Afraid of experiencing any in this game 10 10weapons there is a Wide assort of Weapons to fit you in this game but do not expect too much there are the Main Weapons you would except from a game like this and maybe a Little_Bit more due to an monster Invasion going on all around you the game has Its_Own Signature Weapon a Crowbar but that is also the only melee Weapon that you can use in this game while you progress through the game you will find Weapons but there aren t many so every Weapon you get you make use of because all of them are unique as i Won t spoil much here i will just tell you that there are Weapons from the pistol even to such Weapons like a Rocket launcher and a few of Alien techologies are found in the game as well you will find yourself exploring all around you to get some ammo for your Favourite Weapon because it gives you tons of ammo for a Wide selection of Weapons and the ammo that you need may not be findable anywhere when you shoot a Gun it feels like you shoot a Gun meaning that you will find the Gun Bouncing back in your hand when you shoot it and you can hear the sound for Gun firing is well done as well but when shooting a Rocket launcher you will not Bounce_Back but if you move while shooting it the Rocket will go wrong and Hit another spot depending on which Way you moved even if you don t have any ammo you get to use a Alien techonlogy which has Unlimited ammo even though it recharges over time it doesn t take much of it and it has special abilities 8 5 10enemies from the headcrab even to the Final Boss the enemies are nicely balanced you are slowly introduced to each enemy and its tactics so you know what to use on it and what to do you probably Won t find yourself facing a unnormally Big Army of enemies if you aren t well Armed once you learn the tactics the enemies use it is Easy to Defeat them just keep a look out for them or otherwise you might find yourself in quite a Pickle i wouldn t say that the enemies are Hard you can use the terrain to your advantage as well luckily one Group of your enemies is fighting another so you can use that to your advantage as well if you find the right moment Wink but i wouldn t rely on such stuff i would just get myself a nice arsenal of Weapons and go Defeat that Crowd of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit s there are a few Weapons which have Unlimited ammo and i feel that is unbalanced don t go prancing around as a Pony as well you will get your heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit kicked there are Flying enemies crawling enemies walking enemies and Big enemies the crawling Ones are Easy just keep a look out for them so they don t get the jump on you the Flying Ones need the right Weapons like a zoom in Crossbow for they fly around and shoot at you and when you get Close to them they just Fly_Away the walking Ones are Easy enough just keep a shotgun on your hand and you will be Ok but the Big Ones need a plan a strategy and a assault of Weapons 9 5 10graphics from Black Mesa labs to even Alien fields of doom this game is amazing it now has Its_Own Hd models so a few things look Better when the models are turned on any computer will be Able to get this game running so why not jump in it already and as this game was made in 1998 don t expect Modern graphics but that couldn t Stop you from playing this game could it the terrain is kind of blocky and the characters as well but if you look past that Point Get_Ready to indulge into a game that made Gaming as it is today and the graphics aren t that Bad everything is quite understandable they have made the graphics the Best Way they could and i don t blame them because i don t vote a game by its graphics and if you can t stand the graphics there is a source Version of the game made by valve as Well_There is a Version made by fans as well but i wouldn t recommend that because it is modified a bit but the Original is the Best in my opinion as it is the completly unmodified Version of half Life and the Best out there of Course that is if you look past the graphics there are even little details specified in the originl game but they Won t be seen so Good and will be kind of blurred but be sure to keep your Eyes lit for there are many levers buttons and things like that throughout the game that blend in with the enviroment 8 5 10overall look even though this game is dated it is definently not Dead be sure to pick this game up on a sale or even Buy it at its full Price because this game is Worth every cent you Pay for it i loved the game it really Got me pulled in and the Story was just stunning i loved every place i Came_Upon to in this game seeking New Adventure and traveling on into the deep unknown this game is filled with interesting moments and is guaranteed to keep you aroused until the very ending this is a great classic and everyone should Play it it is an experience not to be missed it changed Gaming as it is now and was a Hit in Gaming and it still is a wonderful game Final score 9 10 reviewed by ultrix

Tf2 is awesome tumps up to valve
i was hoping to really love this game but Unfortunatley after playing it for only a short while i have to agree with most of the other reviews the graphics are abysmal actually worse by Far than graphics in games 10 years ago to put that in context this year we will celebrate Half_Life_2 s 10th Anniversary maybe i just have slow internet thanks Abbott but seeing other players move around without even an attempt at Leg animation is disconcerting following on the servers are slow as all hell if you do manage in a Semi timely Fashion to find and log onto a server assuming the slow Response time hasn t basically frozen your Mouse you will be greeted with some of the Worst lag you Ve Ever_Seen be forewarned Fair traveller you will think it s a one off lag Problem verily it is not i have never actually tolerated this much lag in a game and it seems to be a pretty Standard part of Nether so there s that this of Course makes Combat a frantic Button mash with little to no skill at first i thought this Might_Be why i can t seem to move smoothly but then i realised that the entire World Has_Been put together so half assedly that physically conected Land elements like a floor and a ramp might require you to jump over some Imaginary partition Holding them together clipping is as you can imagine basically just part of the ambience at this Point then there s the game itself it seems to have no idea how games are meant to Work there are safezones where you spawn when you die in Theory in a safezone you can t use Weapons can t die and the Nether can t get in this will periodically cease to be true and you have to Run around repairing the Anti Nether devices as a Noob you will be the only one running around repairing Anti Nether devices Everyone_Else can survive without them just Fine when you aren t running for your Life from aliens which Teleport by the Way utterly ruining the Point of a Zombie Survival game you re couriering parcels from a to b in the vain Hope that you can scrounge enough bits and pieces from these transactions to craft a Semi decent Weapon none of this is immediatley obvious to you as the game has basically no explanation of anything at all upon undertaking a Task outside the safezone you will rapidly become aware of the fact that the difficulty of the Nether around you will in no Way be tempered to suit your skill Level or Armoury leading me on my first Run to take on a small Nether Army which included a Golem Try to Guess what they re like with nothing by a can Gun one shot shotgun made from a spray can and a Sword needless to say i died on subsequent attempts i found fewer Nether which was great for me but alas this came at the Price of having other players around me it turns out that the average Nether player is Cut from the same Cloth as a Day z player and will galdy follow a n00b out of the Safe Zone for the explicit Purpose of killing them and looting the 10 dollars they have fortunately for them since they tend to already have automatic Weapons and Heavy body Armour this is an enetertaining and Low risk Sport for those of us trying to figure out the game it is not in short i have yet to find any element in this game which i think is Good you find eclectic items throughout the World all of which are terribly rendered and usually look like an entire Stash of discrete items much to your chagrin you sort of have to Guess which Ones can be combined at the Weapon Smith and into what until then you re lugging around 50kg of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit with no Way to use it things pop up on the screen which i m sure are meant to be informative but mean absolutely nothing if you Haven t had it Explained before and when you start out your chance of Survival is approximately 0 since you spawn with nothing but what you could put into a global Stash i assume this bit is a bit fuzzy after Dying it makes it nigh on impossible to ever Advance to any reasonable Level statistically any Level of enemy can appear anywhere except the reapers and players have trained themselevs to see all non Tribe members are walking goody bags pinatas the game has a decent idea behind it and if it were designed by competent designers and hosted on Semi decent servers with a reasonable how to Guide and some mechanism giving New players are Fair shot it d be Worth the 15 at this Point though i wouldn t even Waste the bandwidth on it if it were Free
by now you re probably aware of the game s gimmick it s an emotionally punishing morality based Knock_Off of dark Heart Apocalypse now masquerading as a Generic fps the game aims to put you into a series of morally conflicting positions situations you would likely have faced in many other fps s but it tries to humanise your opponents and confront you with the ramifications of your actions cute if you want to get a Better idea of what the themes are and how they re implemented Extra credits has two Good videos about it on yt one with one without spoilers if you can put up with the pretentious High morality fapping to the game so let s look at this one three levels the morality mechanic the themes of morality and ptsd from a narrative Perspective and the actual Quality of the game Play otherwisethe morality mechanicthe themes of morality manifest themselves as game Mechanics when you periodically Come across " Moral " situations and have to make a Decision about how to proceed here s how they Ve utterly heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ed it up at times and one Scene in particular everyone keeps raving about you re presented the Illusion of Choice but no actual Choice you do the one thing the game lets you do and are treated to what i assume was meant to be an emotional Cut Scene to punish you for it i can not feel Bad for doing the thing the game required this Isn t console players blubbering into their controllers this is the Pc Master Race we Ve been dropping Chemical Weapons on civilians since Postal you Got Ta bring something Better than that the Majority of the time the game misleads you about your options there are hidden " High morality " Alternatives in a lot of cases sure it s nice for the game to put explicit and hidden Alternatives in but the thing is you can just Play the game the Way the game tells you to and it still works Fine there s no Reason to look for Alternatives in fact i d Ve been more morally invested had i seen the High morality option and still felt i needed to take the Low morality Choice and finally and probably most egregiously the Moral choices you make seem so to have absolutely no impact on the game why would i make the Moral Choice here i m trying to get from this Level to the next one and i will shoot a Civilian in the Head if that s what the game says i need to do to progress the Story i absolutely loathe ending changes based on a morality meter a La Bioshock dishonored but if you implement a morality mechanic it needs to at least Change the game Play somehow the entire game seems to assume that everyone who plays a game like Bf or Cod must spend their entire time vacillating over how they could solve each Problem in a Moral Way i like i think most normal Pc gamers just did what the game said i should do i m not interested in the lives of npc s who don t even get a name tag i don t Care it s a game it s a Challenge to get from a to b you need either really Good storytelling or something particularly special to make Me_Feel things or harder still to make my feelings Factor into my game Play Style the narrative themesthe Terrible implementation into the game Play not withstanding the artistic Value here is pretty High the Story is kind of interesting despite its obvious plot holes the Way they represent constant descent the psychosis Colour schemes loading screen accusations the 4th Wall breaking they re not all immediately obvious but they re there and they re pretty well thought out and it Ll give you plenty to mull over and wonder about on a second Play through while we re at it the General visuals are pretty Sweet actually so Good Job there the actual game playi Won t say that graphics don t matter or that narrative doesn t matter but i will say and i will defend this to the hilt they matter less than Mechanics a game with a pretty Poor delivery can still be Good if its Mechanics are solid but the opposite is rarely true Spec Ops the line does not have Good Mechanics i mean yes it s so so agonisingly obvious that this is a Port from a console game and it has what are pretty Standard Mechanics for a console game i Guess so Fine but i m sitting on Pc wondering why i spend half my time Hiding_Behind a Bench or Wall or ornamental plant Pot taking turns to fire at enemies who are also Hiding_Behind whatever debris magically happened to be there the most Tactical thing in the game is Blowing_Up explosive barrels or taking advantage of the ridiculously contrived breaking Glass to unleash an avalanche of Sand mechanic the whole handful of times the game remembered it wanted that to be a thing a fortunately all the miniguns scattered around shopping centres can be turned around and used to Mow_Down waves of suicidal enemies your npc sbut the Worst the absolute Worst and this i can not forgive a game are your npc s in Theory you have a Sniper and a Heavy and you can light up a Target for them to take out yeah Good Luck with that they re useless as all hell they get in your Way a lot by the time they eliminate a Target for you you could just have done it yourself since you need to have the reticle on the Target anyway to tag them but to top it off if they get shot you need to Run in and revive them and they have no idea of how to not get shot heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Stealth these guys assume that not only are you going to speed Run n Gun this game but that you will somehow provide much Better Cover for them than mere Concrete or Sandbags ever could so eschew both in favour of just sitting out in Plain sight possibly the Worst example of npc s ruining any Hope you have of making Good Tactical choices is one Scene where you see a Yacht in the Desert plenty of openings no aerial Cover and a reasonable amount of Open ground between you and it Open ground which has an inbound Truck load of enemies i wanted to stay put in my indestructible Aircraft Hull with a Box of nades a Box or ammo High ground advantage and crucially one small controllable entrance but my highly trained Delta Force sidekicks thought our only Hope for Survival would be to Run like idiots for the Yacht and then stay put half Way when i didn t Run with them needless to say they Got mowed down and i lost the game for not reviving them Fast enough if the game had let me i d Ve shot them in the first 5 minutes and gone on alone but alas the Point of the game seems less about killing the enemies and staying alive than it does basically babysitting two idiots with the Survival instincts of a screamapillar through a War Zone dodging bullets to shoot them full of Adrenalin Final thoughtsover all the idea of the game was Fine - put players in a Situation where they question their actions despite playing a game or even question their actions in all games the Problem is it didn t Work must like the " would you kindly " Scene in Bioshock it didn t Work because i did what i did because that s how you make game progress the designers may have tried to go Meta and accept that players rage quitting would just be one of their " endings " or Try to argue that the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Mechanics are there to fill you with a sense of unease to foreshadow the descent into madness theme but really it didn t Work Good idea implement it Better the visuals were stunning and some of the little bits and pieces of depression were nice like the slowly decaying Soldier in the Menu screen but the Core Mechanics were heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit the game Play was highly Linear it was all Cover based shooting the shooting itself was clunky and frustrating the npc s are worse than the enemy and even the storyline needed tidying up if you re making an fps make an fps once you Ve managed to do that well then we can talk about themes and Story but at the end of the Day morality does not belong in games especially not shooters they
it is evident from the start that this game is only intended to be played Online ideally a game should be a perfectly Good standalone with an Online option for later once you Ve completed Everything_Else and have become bored this is the opposite a Multiplayer with a Single player tacked on as an afterthought ignoring the Poor graphics and General design reminiscent of Postal 2 and similar games which were never intended to be taken seriously the design of the ai in this game is appaling by Far the Worst i Ve Ever_Seen not only the enemy ai but your own team no attempt was made to make the team anything More_Than backup muscle team members can t be ordered to Hold Attack positions or execute objectives they follow you around stupidly and shoot at things which happen to stand directly in front of them not even noticing when they are being repeatedly shot the enemy ai is similarly stupid not noticing things in Plain sight but they have the advantage of clipping through you and your team to get behind you very quickly so there s that not to mention overwhelming Force granted the game is designed to Hold off violent confrontation as long as possible but with the ai the Way it is this is impossible playing offline will guarantee Police arriving within a Minute and that would lead one to Hope that the gunplay Mechanics are at least decent they are not besides the lack of reticle which Ok i can live with but is Odd given the Hit confirmation reticle the aiming moving and shooting are all pretty Bad nothing Horrendously wrong but Poor all Round on the issue of Weapons However it is impossible to Pick_Up Weapons from Fallen cops and it s obvious that in order to enjoy a decent range of Weapons you basically need to get the dlc now i have a 20 limit on games and this is not about to convince me to break that limit any time soon and with the current discounts i can justify some of the dlc which would allow me to make the game at least presentable wanting players to join the steam fanpage in order to unlock a bunch of basic Gear is i feel rather heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit it s a pretty Low tactic to Force people to be exposed to your promotions in Exchange for making the one game they did Buy Semi playable a very dlc based experience and as such a Poor game as for the levels they re the same i Ll be doing a Different Job and running through the building on autopilot because i Ve seen it before except that the Safe is in a Different Location now and why does it keep updating it feels like every time i start the game it needs to do an Update games should never be updated make an optional Patch and distribute bugfixes Asap but any major overhauls save for the sequel all in all i m Hoping that once i Play multipler with friends the only Reason i was told to get the game it Ll become somewhat Good but as Far as going it solo to Try and build up those skill points goes it is a painful painful experience not even Worth the bandwidth to download the Base game imho
Tl Dr below10 minutes in and i was bored 30 minutes in and i was hooked Hard reset is no more or less than the quintessential Old School Shooter it lacks any real form of Cover leaning and most shockingly Crouch and the maps are incredibly Linear there s no notion of Stealth or sniping or any serious Problem solving it s a very Spam y game you just take on waves of enemies as they Come there are Different sorts of enemies but it doesn t matter much in terms of just sinking enough ammo into them until they die enemies drop four kinds of drops Health Green Rifle ammo Red plasma Gun ammo blue and Nano Orange you also have a Shield but it regenerates automatically you collect enough Nano and you earn an upgrade both of your Weapons as well as your General Gear upgrade the same Way everything has 5 modes the last two of which get unlocked later and each Mode has 2 additional upgrades beyond the first for a total of 15 upgrades for each Weapon and your Gear for Weapons this tends to mean a primary Attack and secondary function or Attack and a Passive Bonus in each of the 5 modes each Weapon uses the same Ammunition for each Attack and each Mode albeit at Different Rates your Environment is pretty dangerous there are High explosives all over the place as well as electrified items which when damaged shock everything within range for a period of time before exploding additional from time to time you encounter Random flame throwers in the walls you can take down entire waves of enemies with just the explosive and Electric death traps lying around that s basically it that s the entire game as Far as i Ve played it anyway on the down side the Gun Play Isn t all that imaginative and you don t always have time to swap to all your cool New upgrades in the heat of Battle this combined with the High linearity Wave format of enemy encounters Terrible terrible Voice acting and Story not that it has any real impact on the game and the fact that despite what the pictures look like above the artistic Style really Isn t all that nice makes me sort of sigh and dream of what this game could Have_Been imho what this game could Have_Been is Shadow Warrior Redux which i believe was a perfect and shining example of what happens when you put Modern game Technology and philosophy into an Old School Shooter in a sense Hard reset is like a Poor man s Shadow Warrior definitely not Worth the same amount of money i just Picked_Up Hard reset for like 2 50 Usd Soo not complaining on the upside though if you do like your Old School shooters this is a Good game it does what it sets out to do it s Fun it s destructive it s Fast paced during Combat sequences and you can just go insane ammo Conservation hasn t been a Problem yet normal difficulty over all i Haven t found the game to be really difficult at all which is not to say that i Haven t died yet Bottom_Line is i m enjoying it i d recommend it and though i Haven t played it enough to comment on the complaints about its short length i d say even at full cost 15 Usd i think it s Fair Tl Dr solid game proper Old School Shooter experience no major faults besides heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Story and acting but nothing mind blowing either i d recommend it to friends
Iz a Rly Gud game d
muito Bom
awesome game
the Update doesnt download
great game i Hav enjoyed it Soo much
an amazing game to Play with your friends the amount of things you can do in this game that will give you long lasting enjoyment is endless
games not Bad for a Pile of blocks
would not reccomend if money is important to you
if you have that kind of imagination that never ends get this game for the sake of all that is Good
absolutely incredible and interesting New Approach on Zombie Survival and to top it off it was all done by one Young individual great Fun well Worth the 5 dollar upgrade as well
if you like naked men Baring rocks chasing you across a Landscape full of Kos players who live in scrap Metal houses then i can highly reccomend this game
Es un juego super bueno 3 a Mi me gusto
a Littler buggy but very Fun
goodd
when i decied to Play this before the 2nd game i wasn t sure if this would be Worth it but i found out quickly that i was very wrong the first game is just as stunning and amazing as the 2nd one the setting is beautiful and levels interesting puzzles are simple most of the time but getting Exp pots and finding chests is the real difficulty in this game it makes you want to explore every inch of the Level to make sure you didn t Miss a Single thing and i love that this game has to be one of my Favorite games i Ve played and i can t Wait to finish it and continue playing trine 2
plague inc Evolved is probably the first game that has made me actually fear for my safety it s also the first game that allows me to Destroy Humanity with diseases like RIRE and weed which i had named myself for a small Laugh while the game is in Early access it seems to be mostly done with only a few things missing such as Multiplayer and the tutorial but that doesn t Stop it from being a Good game with what it has the game is in Early access and is based off the Popular smartphone App with the same name and well yes you could Play that for 2 but you wouldn t have as many features achievements there s a ton of them or visuals since the game looks great on Pc the App is however a Good means as to see how the game works game explanation basicly you Select a type of Disease all of which Work differently you then Select a starting Country to infect your first victim and as your virus spreads infects kills ect you gain points which you can then spend to gain upgrades which do a viraty of things from allowing it to infect Certain animals to making it more resistant to heat or Cold which can effect the outcome and reaction of the World greatly your first time playing will probably Come as a Quick Defeat as you learn which upgrades are Best at what time in your diseases Development and i would love to go into detail about my strategy but this is a Review not a Guide dso is the game Worth the 14 99 Price tag in it s current state the answer is probably not unless you re a Big Fan of the smartphone game or a Fan of these types of games the Problem with the game in my opinion is that most of the diseases feel the same they do all have differences but most are so small you barely feel a difference between them which can Cause the game to get boring Fast the Zombie and mindworm diseases which are New feel very well done providing a fresh New experence due to their completely Different upgrades and playstyle from the rest of the diseases and if other diseases were to follow suit and get a redesign to Make_Them all unique from each other i would be much more willing to recommend this game for its Price while i can t fully recommend the game for the Price right now i can only Hope the game will Grow to be Worth 14 99 because it is a Good game it just needs a little more grabbing power to keep people coming back for more and although i m not quite sure how Multiplayer will Work it could just be the thing to do it thanks for reading
a great Adventure puzzle platformer for a cheap Price although i did like the first one more this is still a great game
although it is a beautiful and stunning game there were a few things which ruined the experence for me 1 it was Hard to figure out what i was supposed to do or where i was supposted to go sometimes 2 lack of choices i wanted to decide where i went i can chose how i get there but not where i get to 3 Stealth is pretty much non existant 4 the Police this is the Main Reason i didn t like this game i loved taking my time to look around and explore but the Police forced me to continue in some levels you have to Run through a Room of Police without any Clue of where your going which was frustrating 5 Combat sucks i hated how Combat worked and in some levels it was required and Boss fightsif you can get past all these things then you will deffinetly enjoy the game it is cheap and interesting
in it s current Early access state it Isn t enjoyible for me i was hoping it would be more like quake live s instagib ctf which it Isn t i tried to Play my first game after doing the tutorial me and my team couldn t do anything against the other team everytime they scored a goal Someone_Else on their team would have the Ball again within seconds shooting people is hopeless moving around is a pain and i didn t have a Clue what i was supposed to do during an actual game even after i had finished the tutoral just a frustrating experence overall on a Good note the game graphicly looks nice and is cheap but that Won t get me to Buy it
cheap Fun game Worth alot of hours
addictive
its Ok

one of the Best f2p games out there and is Worth trying out
it is a Good game Hard but enjoyable Way Different to other shooting games
9 10 would only Play for the text to Voice chat only spamming weird stuff
Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive is what i call an upgrade of call of Duty the game handles well with frame drop once in a while there are some thing which they can improve on like the music and sound effect just tuning them to fit the game is the biggest down for me but i remommend this game to anyone Who_Wants_To shooting very Good handling guns at the other team Gameplay 8 10music and sound 6 10level design 7 10extras camos 10 10overall 8 10
when i first Heard about thenew borderlands game i couldn t Wait then when i Got it i played about 3 hours of it and Got bored when i first Got borderlands 2 and borderlands 1 i loved it when i installed borderlands 1 i played from 7 pm to 3 am with out knowing but the the Pre sequel just didn t seem as interesting as the other games so im not going to Waste any money of the Pre sequel and im going to Play destiny on my playstation and Play borderlands 1 and 2 on Pc until the next borderlands game

" like Skyrim with guns " ign 11 10
this game s ai is extremely Hard by saying this the programmed ai can jump around corners giving you a Bloody Heart Attack just to confirm this is a Shooter not a Horror game except for that there is a large amount of bugs on a postive not it can be Fun sometimes
one of the Best sandbox games i Ve Ever_Played definetly Worth buying if creativity is your thing
this once simple and Fun game has gone proffesional and is now more suited to hardcore gamers as Majority of it s Fanbase focous on trading and Betting such a Shame as Counter strike used to be Good if you are either have a talent at moving your Mouse Fast or are extremely competitive this game is for you
a amazing Jungle Survival Adventure game extremely Graphic intensive so it requires a nice Gaming rig
this game is a great Way to either torture Prisoners or Try and forgive and forget their Crimes i generally don t choose the latter this game has a great Intro and Backstory with lots of New things appearing through out the game great Buy for a sandbox and reform Loving Gamer
great Story line and immersive campaign great Purchase for Stealth gamers as there are many ways to take out targets the game is aimed to be for offline use but the makers tried to make it Online but in doing so the game became cheap and plasticy rather than the solid offline experience they wanted Good Buy
the small Fan Base seemed to shrink even more very sad as this is a really Fun creative Shooter if Online Block builders are your thing then go and get some Bang for your Buck
much Better than newer Counter strike versions because the same source textures are used Better detail a real Golden oldie perfect Purchase
cheap game Good Gameplay and Good for me that has only a little money
wat you need dis game its Better than Cod Trust me p
i recommend no if you use Mac notebook the game only supports Mac Desktop overall the Gameplay is simple and Fun if i could actually see what im doing i use Macbook
Best fps ive played since Counter strike source RIRE i would definitely recommend to people who want to Play with 21 year Old squeekers and lastly Buy me Cs go for some Tf2 Keys and hats
great game 10 10 would Play again
one of the games which i always wanted a Pirate rpg game ignore the Bad reviews as i don t see a Problem in the game when playing except some bugs it s very Fun and i recommend it
amazing Must_Have for any people who enjoy Rts games

pros yelling Simulator you will get the Hang of it if you Play such games like the Elder scrolls Franchise beautiful graphics and atmosphere creative and funny Dialogue from any character in the game especially the classes in deadliest Warrior great music that fits so well for each setting of the game interesting objectives that makes you Come back for more cons the game seems a bit laggy the World seems so beautiful that some Pcs or laptops can t handle it pings can Expand extremely Fast if your internet is crap Combat seems to be in the form of Rock paper scissors especially being put in unwinnable situations as an Archer not enough cosmetics and hats overall this game seems to be one of my Favorite games in Pc but only if your internet is Good just give it time to load up and when it Picks_Up you my Friend are going to experience a game that really Captures the Medieval feel and every gamers dream about Fantasy battles as Knights for being a Hero or villain in a server i love this game so muchi give it a 9 5 10
the Best part about this game is that when you go to the car Chase you a sitting an Invisible jet10 10
this is the definition of either a Michael Bay movie or America
to be honest i never looked Forward to Play this game but when i did i realised how Good it was and Got hooked onto it very easily

it might seem reduntent to give Prais to this game seeing how many people Play this game but i just want to give my opinion as a Person who is not in to the hardcore Pc Crowd this game is a ture marvel great Gameplay characters Weapons Map and a distinct art and graphical presentation that i believe can Work on a Wide veriety of Pc setups in short i would recomend this game to everyone with a Pc and if you like hats you are going to have a Good time
Best batman game so Far the game Has_Been fixed Currently with my I3 6100 and gtx 970 Pc im getting 60fps on Max settings with v sync enabled and yes Maxed settings use about 4gb vram which the gtx 970 did no Problem even on Shadow of Mordor

great game altogether the game has a great Multiplayer experience on one hand there can be players who are kind and Try to Help you as much as possible then on the other hand are the players who love stealing other peoples items materials etc which can be very Entertaining at times gathering materials can be quite frustrating at times but once you achieve building a House securing your area and establishing allies the game gets very exciting raids are a great part of the game as well i tend to Partner up with friends and allies grab as much C4 as possible and raid every Base in sight some bases may have few materials but most of the time you Ll find heavily fortified bases that have too many materials and Weapons to Count to conclude Good game Buy now
a great all Round Moba for all players p s if you want to learn russian in a week make sure you Play this game many russians
absolutely great game the Physics of the game are hilarious the building part of it can be heaps Fun too and when you finally get to your objective in my case the Mun you just Sit back and smile
10 10 Good game such amazing many huehue
10 10 would recommend very moist Gameplay 3
it s Good but not the type of game for me
this game would be Worth it if the Controls weren t so Hard
to be honest complete Waste of money the game gets boring in 10 minutes not even
not a Bad game for Alpha i think with future Improvements with Realism and other aspects of the game would make it more Fun for everyone d p s Pls no sharks Pls no
one of the Best Free to Play on steam

very very Good game if you like driving simulation game likeeurotruck simulation and so on i would recomend this if you like those sorts of games
this is a really great and i do recomend it but one thing i think it needs is steam Workshop Support
this game is wonderful everything about it the Gameplay quests bosses omg its amazing
love this game cant say enay thing Rong about it just Trust me go and Buy this for you i have played 99 7 Hrs and every last Minute was grate
love this game so Far can t Wait to see what future updates bring really enjoy the Freedom and Survival aspects would recommend to anyone who likes Sand Box type games
i Ll be honest i Haven t played any other telltale game only seen others Play them but i do think this is a great game at least the 1st episode was and the Gameplay is a well done in my Humble opinion i am Loving the Story and can t Wait to Play the later episodes and recommend that you give it a Try if you like Minecraft and telltale s other games it even runs well on my Poor excuse of a Pc d
este juego Es genial
masterpiece
i imagine it would be an amazing game you know if it worked at all on Windows 8 i purchased gta Iv and eflc in a pack gta Iv works Fine after a bit of tweaking eflc simply does not want to Work i suggest you Wait for this game to Fall in Price sales before buying it just in case
i do recommend this game only just however there s a lot of Work to do as there are plenty of Gameplay breaking glitches which are frequent but the authors are clearly passionate about the Development and i m excited as to the future of this game what i love about the Forest although Zombie games are common nowadays this one takes the cake the Gameplay is fluid and scary you Ll be kept on your toes the whole time you Play what will happen next will the natives manage to Track you wherever you go or will you fight them off the Best thing about this game is the ai i can tell that the developers put most of their effort into it and that s a Good thing comparing this game s ai to Dayz is like comparing two Different worlds the mutants carefully creep around you trying to catch you off Guard or maybe they will see you at a Distance and hide in the bushes the World is Truly alive the seemingly luscious Environment during the Day becomes a Nightmare of constant patrols and attacks at Night this is the most beautiful element of the game the oncoming darkness is Truly something to be feared the Way you construct buildings is innovative and Original i Ve Never_Seen it done in another game before the Realism is astounding what i didn t like about the Forest the glitches that s all i do understand this is an Early access game but there are Certain glitches which are acceptable and those that are not to make matters worse the developers have decided to Update the game on a predefined interval that leaves a lot of time in the middle in the future i would think they will need to have a Regular Update for game breaking bugs and the like but as well as this maintain the longer Update time for the bigger and Better updates
it s Good great game the cheaters are a bit of a Problem and quite Frankly i Ll take a break until great measures are taken in catching them
now Safe for wallets
guns 2 the second Duel for the entirety that i had played feels like guns the Duel but with more regulation as a Shield Trooper i didnt feel clunky at moments i actaully was Able to get around faster than the other two female classes Silent avengers are a remnant of the Original guns the game played as Armored Core would if they Mixed it with Tf2 and warframe the pve is well made in a arcadey Beat Em_Up Fashion as you kill enemies they drop Health and ammo till you progress to the next Room Level etc Shield troopers even with the Shield still Fell short to the enemies massive Count though even with 3 other partners so its not the easiest game to Win the Cash Shop is pretty Standard and all the guns have little to no difference in Base dps oh and dont pick Shield Trooper because if you do youll have to Pay in game Currency for the other characters a solid 81 100
great game that managed to catch my attention for hours if not many more to Come major changes with the formula Movement is much more fluent with perks that allow shooting while sprinting and vaulting etc jetpacks and Rocket launchers Remind_Me of tribes most Firearms feel unique some just feel like Standard Cod fodder the everygun assault Rifle that looks like a m16 characters with special abilities biggest Change and i love it melee Has_Been improved removing the one Hit kill Knife and replacing it with a striking Attack unique to your firearm maps well i dont know they are made well and blend with the New Free running aspects still not as Good as blops1 graphics does this even matter really so long as i get 60fps content is not lacking at all they brought back hardcore ffa and for that i am eternally greatful Better than blops2 worse than blops Better than w w worse than Mw Better than every other Cod not mentioned Better than titanfall and its lack of weighty weaponry
Better Combat than Arma 2 now are the guns Better Yeh attachments Make_Them Better do they handle Better well i d argue that the damage system and how bullets flyed was Better in Arma 2 and that people move too Fast when jogging in Arma 3 but then again people still Play Battle Royal and Koth in Arma 3 so yeah Arma 3 is Better
great game with loads of replayability it plays much like doom but an expansive inventory and crafting system its an Indie title so it requires a crafting system enemies are always hiding in the Best places and jump out at the Worst times the pixelation and visibility system plays to its advantage as the game has a eerie Survival Esque atmosphere where common games with there dark very very dark graphics and lack of light as this game has a Cone of view system overall if you like mazes top down shooters Survival and inventory Management Play this oh and you Ll die
well once you get your first blueprint the game really Open up i mean first purchased bliueprint Btw until then you re left in the dark about simple crafting and modding after killing Vor the game Picks_Up in speed and co Op not Fun when you Play on the usual farming maps
lkkl
Good game to Play
awesome
Garry s Mod crashed 2 games of mine including Garry s Mod i dont know how to fix this but the game is dope
lel
Ainsley Harriot

a little scary to begin with but when you get Far in the game its really challenging and Hard and make you want to delete the game but still an overall great game i would recomend this game to anyone
this is one of the Best games Iv Ever_Played 10 10 would feel again Worth all the 10 dollars
Better than Fallout cool graphics cool guns lots of Gameplay amazing Open World game lots a fun9 10 can t find someone to Play with

Fable Anniversary is a Hd remake of the Original Extended Version Fable the lost chapters keep in mind it is the Hd remake not Fable 4 so many people are giving this game a Bad name for the wrong reasons its been 10 years since the release of the Original game and to celebrate Lionheart have done a Hd remake of their game of Course it will Run the same now lets talk about the Gameplay Fable Anniversary Has_Been masterfully re crafted the Original Fable with beautiful textures its absolutely stunning i could not Help myself staring at the Landscape while being ganked by couple of those filthy Hobbes and bandits the game ran smoothly for me and could not Help myself reminicise Good moments when i was playing Fable tlc Combat system is still fantastic like its predecessor although some of the enemies i thought were just cheap and annoying the npcs are still funny and a Tad stupid like one time i just went to the bowerstone Inn for a Quest when Random villagers kept applauding and Laughing at me when i was trying to have a chat with a Quest giver the Story for me is still excellent and Lovely pretty much my experience with this game Have_Been awesome the only problems were some of the bugs that were initally on before the Update Controls for the Pc are a bit strange and would personally recommend Controller now everything is great even though the game might not seem New this game has mods which will definitely have some bonuses so overall this game i would recommend to people even though people might say this game is Trash it is their opinion for me i love this game and is a great Hd remake Port for the Pc
a visually captivatng yet simple game just absolutely love it wished there were people Online but it is a great Pool game and highly recommend to everybody
one of the Best Sniper games i have played up to date i was not a Fan intially but thanks to V2 i feel like getting V3
what can i say about game it is one of the Best games i have played this year i was not a Fan of the Elite games until recent i Got my Hands on Sniper Elite V2 this game is magnificient the Open World of the maps of africa are extraordinary the Old and New Mechanics are Refined and are brilliant much Better than previous game ai has improved from previous game however they are still heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit but are so Fun to kill there is also a lot more Customisation with rifles loadout and lots more Multiplayer is great however needs more people and some touches only Problem is some glitches it has like Invisible ammo Boxes Ad bodies spazzing everywhere what else can i say all i can say is get the game even though its expensive its Worth it
Final Fantasy Iv what can i say about this game first off i Ain t much of Fan of the Final Fantasy series but when i tried Final Fantasy Iv it changed what i initally though of it this Hd remake is brilliant the music like in any other Final Fantasy game is absolute its Fine Orchestral melodies give a fantastic atmosphere in game the Combat system is pretty basic and Lovely i am still not a Fan of it since i prefer more of a turn based mechanic like civilization and so on still its Good but i stress everytime when i am doing a move and if i click on the wrong Menu i am losing Precious seconds giving the enemy ai an Opportunity to Defeat my Party the Story is great you Play as a dark Knight called Cecil or in my game heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit who Follows the orders of Supreme tyrant King he and his Red wings go to the City of mysidia and Attack on its peaceful people for its Crystal i Won t go on any longer with the Story but becomes interesting the more you know the characters in game are all facinating and quite lively the Cut scenes in the game include Voice overs which i found great finally Final Fantasy Iv succeeds on being a true jrpg the only thing i had Problem with was what to do next in this game i am told what to do and when accomplish i just don t know what to do or go where a bit more guidance in game would have done the trick also this game has very Good engrish you will Notice some when you read the text carefully overall this game i found it a Good rendition on my steam Library and can not Wait for more of the Final Fantasy games to get on steam the is excellent fulfulling what a jrpg Should do with excellent music interesting Story and well thought characters in addition has some faults with guidance in game and contains some well written engrish
meh

intense realistic Multiplayer Good game Play and no bugs found Whilst playing
this game is the Best for relaxing 9 10 needs more dlc to add trucks

i love this game especially the Combat and Stealth love the upgrades and skills graphics and sounds the only Problem i Ve encountered is that im on the Gondola transport Mission and when the Gondola Stops i can t make the rope i can t progress past this and it s really annoying me but i can t seem to find anyone else who has this issue i Ll find a Way to fix it and continue Loving this game i would recommend this to anyone who has a brain
i love this game its very Fun joyfull and makes you feel how to really survive a Zombie appocolypse
one of the Best Gaming experiences of the past 3 years for me i became immersed in the Story and in the Fragile nture of Lara and her Adventure it works like Good game should it creates emotions an you become attached to some charcters and the Story is really Good and of some Historical fact which keeps the Story really interesting Good Combat system Good upgrade system and great exploartion
this game has alot of drama and keeps showing me more suprises i strongly recomend this game

Worst game ever
awesome game Good time Waster if you are into that sort of thing like the layout ascenion Style Gameplay also really challenging to get to those Higher levels
Wicked game dde started out as a remake of dungeon defenders which was an epic game if i do say so myself but since dde s release its become something more then dungeon defenders because of its constant getting updated its gotten alot more content and the leveling system was changed in dungeon defenders they Level Cap was eventually raised to Lvl 100 which the Intro of New patches as where with dungeon defenders eternity all that content is already in but the Level Cap is sitting back at the Original Cap of Lvl 60 which allows alot more Room for upgrades in the future by Far the Best mmo Tower defense game i Ve seen out there although its not fully a Tower defense game because you can also Run around as a character and shoot Swing Big heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit swords fire lasers use Magic projectile to kill you re enemies or you could just Sit back and let you re Towers and pets do the killing for you this game covers alot of Different Play styles and is great Fun with friends or by yourself of Course every game Isn t without if flaws or boring parts a couple of boring parts i Ve found are the massive grinds to get end Level Gear although this Might_Be boring it can also be quite enjoyable dungeon defenders eternity took everything about dungeon defenders and made it even Better but don t take my Word on it Play it for yourself and enjoy

too Good for u
too Good
this game is amazing ever since i bought the game i Have_Been playing for hours endlessly the Story Mode is great not to mention the pretty awesome characters you can unlock the Free Play is mostly the Fun part of this game if you enjoy your Lego games you will definitely enjoy this
the Best game ever super Powers are mind blowing and the Missions are quite amazing as well having the dlc s makes this game super intense and playing it is ten times more Fun the vehicles Haven t really changed much although who needs cars and planes when you can Sprint and glide around the City the Story is quite great and the Gameplay just seems to get Better and Better a must Play for all Saints Row fans 10 10
sr3 is one of the most amazing games i Ve played the storyline is quite Good and the game has fantastic graphics Got me hooked for hours the cars and Weapons are quite awesome too although they should allow to degrade Weapons
the game is a Good game i might understand the negative reviews in some points but the game is solid and bit over 100 levels the only Problem for the game is probably that it gets very addictive but only when you are deep into it i personally love it and let s not forget that doesn t cost a lot i Rate it 4 5
i really didn t like it i m sorry slow and boring
i can understand why Aero s Quest brings out some comtroversy the game falls in the genre of puzzle platformers maybe more platformer than puzzle which is full of Good and Bad titles it s Hard to stand out in this kind of genre Aero s Quest does the Job to me i see why somebody can say that few aspects of the game are outdated but i believe that for that peice the Value is there i personally enjoyed it a lot and i will Play it till i Beat it
cool game by the Cover
Good game very realistic
amzn get it get it get it get it get it geddit
a great addition to the Counter strike series filled with many servers players Old and New and the competitiveness of the people is just overwhelming the game welcomes any player beginner or veteran i d recommend it to anyone who likes Strategic plays positioning and a game takes incredible aiming and reaction speeds to Beat your opponents
Fallout a one of many people s Favourite game in the classic Fallout series Fallout New Vegas is just a piece of something much Greater recommend this to anyone who likes a Post Apocalyptic game setting Mixed with the times of the 1950 s
i recommend this highly to anyone who loves a game that makes you cautiogreat structure of a game Reminds_Me of those Old arcade games you used to Play and when your character died the game ends the binding of Isaac mixes that with its humouress side and those 2 catergories construct well together
you know what they say about Survival games no matter what you Try you will never Win but hey its not the goal that matters its the Journey
get it it Amazin
Best game to Play with friends
so much Fun just needs more content
Fun game i feel it handles lag Better than Tf2 Tf2 is still a great game though
i had Fun playing it while i was not playing Tf2 and l4d2 but going Online is too Hard i get Owned RIRE edit now i have gotten a bit Better Fun to Play with people i only Run into dickbags every 5 matches
great game i have a tone of Fun playing this like Tf2 Fun
great for making Movies but Hard to learn how to RIRE
i think it is the Best
great game Very addicting trying to have the highest Rank among you and your friends and getting the rarest skin of each Gun bragging to your friends about it Got Ta have
Muy bueno Esta bueno Para Ser gratis

Mt daora
payday 2 is a Good game if you Buy it during a sale and truth to be told you only need some dlc to be at the top Meta
simple but not Easy Good Luck
you like Minecraft you l love Terraria you like Cod you l enjoy Terraria you like Good games you will be playing this game Day and Night
very enjoyable game escpecially since it is Free it includes great intense Gameplay Mixed with excellent Gun and player Customisation Haven t really Come across too many bugs which is awesome i d recommend this game if you enjoy Tactical team based shooters and whats there to Loose it s Free
Heard a lot about this game and Have_Been waiting for a sale this game is well Worth the sale money if you re looking for a realistic Tactical Shooter Gameplay is excellent sounds are great only Negative i can see are the graphics but it s decent for source engine
just started playing the game and i m Loving it so Far graphics aren t the Best but i really enjoy the Gameplay if you re into Zombie Survival genres i would definitely recommend this especially when its on sale there are a few negative things about the game though firstly some of the animations look pretty Bad including sliding down ladders Combat and the Controls take a little getting used to but overall it s Different to other Zombie games having to look after and Care for a survivng Community and driving from place to place stocking up on supplies i d give it a 8 10
so Far i have had a heap of Fun with this game and it is also extremely creepy one Minute you are setting up your shelter the next you are fighting for your Survival against Tribal mutants yes there are a few bugs but it s Early access the most annoying one however is that after you save your game a lot of your loot disappears apart from that they are only Minor i d definitely recommend getting this game it s Fun it s cheap and the Price will most likely be risen later on
great Gam full of Action and Fun Better doing it with people you know
so Far very enjoyable game Different from other mmo s but not in a Bad Way Gameplay is pretty Fun from what i Ve played so Far and it s Free downside is probably the graphics they look a bit err but still don t Judge a game on its graphics i d give it a 8 5 10
at first you look at the graphics and think yuck looks like Minecraft it does look like it but Trust me it is very Fun to Play
extremely Fun with a great art Style this game is great for Children Ad adults of all ages i would strongly recommend this game for everyone
Skyrim 10 10 would Bang again
9 11 would plant bomb againthis Kid bunnyhopping all the Way through Ivy out middle and through our connector like a speed demond
i love the modding comuntit for this game every time my frends Online we Play Multiplayer and we blow heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit up
buys game looks in Inv you Ve gained 1 item no Life this game has consumed my Life 5 8
i Drive 300 Miles and not Crash when i Park Crash 5 times and gets deducted points 10 10 Fam
El juego Es Muy bueno El Modo Campana Es increible Aunque El Modo co Op Es Vicioso Muy Buenos graficos y Muy estrategico recomendado
10 10
although i have bearly played this game i really enjoyed how the game played out the co Op element made this game really Fun having friends to Help you shoot zombies revive you or allies and overall having a great time
i can t believe i nearly didn t Buy this game because of the negative reviews so here s mine it works on my Low end doesn t even scrape in the reccomended specs computer smoothly it has improved character Customisation the Dynamic Colour scheme makes the Map look amazing the build system is a great New addition companions are Far Better in Combat and more interesting to talk to the Perk system is Easy to get the Hang of the voicing of the protagonist is fitting and adds to the cinematics of the game dogmeat returns 9 5 10 because it s pretty Dang Good
this game is probably one of the most realistic games of this year the graphics in this game are amazing so Crisp and surreal the Physics are probably the most impressive aspect of the game being so true to nature even the music for this game was amazing i felt inspired by it the characters were in depth and felt like they were real and the goat aspect was brilliant overall i would Rate this game 10 10 for amazing Gameplay
this game is a mind heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit i love it
i love this game but it is destroying my Free time and replacing it with Bonus ducks and Banana hats

tful design is as intricate as ever the Lake Map is a standout there s a Wide Open yet densely populated Yard around the bomb Site which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of Vantage points and hiding spots to separate demolition from defusal players can t Buy between rounds instead it takes a cue from the other New Mode Arms Race in which each kill unlocks another Weapon instantly the Better you do the more you have to switch up the Way you Play and because demolition is so Fast you Ll need to be Quick on your feet
amazing i Ve Met most of my steam friends on this people do say this was a Minecraft Rip off but its not this was relased in 2007 and Minecraft in 2009 so heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit off haters because this is probably one of the Best games on steam highly recommened pros everything except all the Good hosts quit hosting from what ive Heard im New cons Good hosts quit hostingedit mispelled cons

Portal 2 is a great game created by valve you are basically a Guinea pig test subject who is a Girl named Chell and in the previous game Portal the machine that created these puzzels and tricked you and tried to kill you is named glados you eventually kill her well in Portal 2 you are still playing as the Original character Chell and was in a Room where you would be picked for later testing but a robot came alon named Wheatley who comes along and helps you out and you Come across glados turned but of Course Wheatley does something stupid and you have to fight her again going through 19 puzzles and when you Defeat her Wheatley is now in charge and glados s Intelligence is now in a potatoe which you Carry around with you because Wheatley through you two down a Hole and as you travel through the underground you Come across the first testing chambers and find a Story that you will have to find out for yourself but in these testing chambers your using Gel the blue allows you to jump Higher the Orange to move faster and the White allows you to create Portals where it has touched oh and when you get to chapter 6 you will find a Achievement realating to half Life borialis and at the end you send Wheatley into Space and your sent out into a wheat Field i recomend this game to everyone now youre thinking with Portals

okay you may take this game as s but no this game is like a Simulator but Free in this Action ppacked game you will feel like driving a V8 10 10 Try this game out
this game is more Action packed and less confusing then Skyrim or oblivion and has also Got Online experience which improve Elder scrolls alot
love it
a very enjoyable game it is a Good timewaster and quite addicting the puzzle pieces are Different types of shapes every New puzzle making it Different and sometimes harder for the puzzels i would Rate it 7 10 only because it doesnt have many puzzels for you to complete so they need to upgrade it a bit

very Fun game very Rich Story line which flowed really well i absolutely loVe this game but there is always one issue i want more the Story Mode is only 3 hours long at a slow Pace the shorts at an absolute most are 1 hour developers please make more shorts dlc or even a New octodad i would happily Pay an Extra 10usd for 5 Extra shorts i loved the game but i was sad when i completed it i want more
fsx baemust Buy also if you have a couple hundred dollars in your wallet i reccoment buying the hotas Warthog thrustmaster Trust me it is Worth every cent and has never failed me
Well_There is no other Review i can give to this Rip off of Cs that doesn t even Work
one Finger death punch is Bae it s simplistic design and Easy Controls makes this game Easy to Pick_Up and Play the difficulty of the stages progress at the same Pace as your ability and there are very few levels i find too Easy or too difficult if you have 5 in your steam Account i recommend you prioritise this game over any other item of the same Price
i love game Dev tycoon you can create dream game genre and what sort of game it is Action Adventure etc the thing i love the most is the feedback the reviewers give to Help create Better games
prettyy Mad game
so much Fun Surviving the Zombie apocolypse by yourself or with your friends

it s pretty Fun very very similiar to Harvest Moon honestly if you dont like repetitive games then this really Isn t what your looking for its also very addicting ive wasted alot of time on this game so if you dont have the time then don t Play it Ok
it is Ok for a Free game but 15gb of Space
i really like unturned but the thing that i want to be improved or fixed Gas in cars and planes lasts longer more guns and ammo more maps Better servers more Health for all players Better inventory Space and organise apart from those things i Rate 8 8 no h8 M8
i realy like this game it has gotten me to undersatnd alot more about farming
Good game Play encountered a Problem with climbing out of a Cave and didnt spawn me on top of exit and forced me to Fall back in and kill me other than that so Far so Good

this is a very Fun and nice 80s themed Shooter im not Good at spoiler Free reviews so im just gon na keep it short do you like shooters did you like the 80s Action Movies and most importantly do you like to Play as a Badass Action Hero if you do Buy this game d
if you liked half Life i would really recommend getting this expansion im not gon na spoil anything so im just gon na say Buy this if you want more half Life
a Must_Have classic from steam definitely Worth buying
this game is a perfect remake of the Original half Life personally one of the Best remakes i have played in a long time there are a few changes in the remake but for the most part its almost the same as the Original half Life the game still needs xen to be completed but all the other chapters are ready for you to Play and enjoy i say Buy this game if you loved the Original half Life but avoid it if you can t Wait for xen to be completed
had so much Fun plaing this and Collecting resources RIRE we Won on my first Try and killed Final Boss
d
so much Fun d
this game is in a Gamble Decision whether to continue these in game purchases and bugs but please remember the Price is in the Quality of the game we actually Buy i Hope you game Devs find it in your Heart that these games should be relativlty Worth its Price who knows these game Devs look up to comments like this and in the future these people have the mids Touch Dota preference thank you whomever reads this Review and have a nice Day
i would give 8 5 10 braiinssmy Thoughts are i would just Hope of Improvement of graphics and fix and customization of a Hud and a Custom character Select screen if ever nescecary to perform but props to game Devs on the Gameplay itself highly recommended and hoping to be out as soon as possible for those comments saying who dont reccomend the game might have a few bugs and fixes here and there i just Hope the Movement of the game would be a Good one cus the efforts are worthwhile after right the fact is that you guys give all the possibilities there are in a Free to Play game are just awesome all it needs are a Good crew to Help develope and a Good attitude avoiding haters and focusing on the these Mistake people will give here and there hence all in all a Good Worth to download Free to Play game
cool game
excelente juego y Lo bueno Es que Es !gratis 10 10

amazing fps Fun with friends and the trading is pretty addicting aswell
the Best think about this game is you can kill people
Portal 2 one of the Best puzzle games out there the game revolves around not just tests but Chell and the other characters such as wheately glados and of Course Doug ratman in the start of the game you Awake in a strange Room being told that you are in Suspension you go back to sleep then rudely woken up to the sound of someone knocking on the Door and this is where you Meet wheately a brittish accented Core with a bit of an attitude towards you but enough ofn the start of the game lets Focus on the Gameplay the Gameplay is simple shoot either a blue or Orange Portal on a White surface and not a Black one but when you get further into the game it gets dark toned really quickly but i will let you find that out all in all Portal 2 is a great game if your into your puzzles it even has co Op and in didnt even talk about The_Community maps there are literally hundreds of them and still counting if your into a Good Story co Op and puzzles then your going to love this game 9 5 10
when i watched the Trailer for the game i was immediately hooked then i installed the game but what i discovered is that i actually enjoyed the game it keeps pulling me back and that s how a game should be
a Mod turned full game you Play as Stanley a k a employee 427 his Job is to Push buttons on a keyboard yeah imagine that for a Job but he discovers that there is no one there and so the Journey begins with a nutty narrator telling you what to do but you dont have to listen to him say if theres two doors narrator says left but you go right this game is just a Fun little distraction and is Worth the money you spend amusing and sometimes down right quirky its Worth your time and money 8 10
amazing game playing this is just like playing battlefield c o d and Star wars in one
gratuito so que Nao
Alem de estar em versao de testes o jogo e muito divertido
no
very nice fps game
i do not get it
pretty much the Best game ever i think that this game is Better when played with friends rather than bots Anonymous people but i can t know because none of my friends Play it with me however the characters are Fun and the Fast paced Gameplay is really Fun this New 2d take on the Moba genre is generally a great game and while the matchmaking could use some Work the Devs are constantly improving the game they have promised to improve the matchmaking so hopeat issue is soon resolved i Hope this Review convinced you to Buy the game the Devs definitely deserve it
this is cooked
it s like a drug you get Addicted and can t Stop when you think you Ve spent 5 minutes you Ve spent 5 hours your grades start to drop you dont do your homework you still live with your parents because you cant get a Job you think you Ve spent 5 hours but you Ve spent 5 years you re Dead Cs go is damaging lifes of Poor innocent Children don t do Cs go
amazing Deg [?]?deg
this game is awsome steam rules
Nao gostei Uma bosta
um do melhores jogos de fps recomendo a Todos e Quem quizer me adicionar Pra jogar Tamo Junto

o jogo e heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit so Quem Tem muito Bud e lag mais Fora isso Eu recomendo
when i Got this game it looked as though it would be very Fun but as i started playing it i found that it was quite boring and the Gameplay consisted of clicking people so they didn t die at 20 00 i thought that this was a riduculous Price for the game which in all honesty should really be a tablet game the Way you Play it is just not Good for a Pc
nearing the end of a Mission i look at the Way i have networked my collectors across the Map and how i have inched my Way from oNe Edge to the other Covering everything in my wake destroying the creeper in my Way and i realise the creeper and i we aren t so Different an00bisthis statement bares true for both the flash games and the New paid game the Core Gameplay hasn t changed it didn t need to yet more features Have_Been added to Enhance the overall experience i strongly reccomend it if you re unsure you should Try oNe the initial flash games before deciding
great game just like the classic
beautiful Fun Free to Play game
great game

so as i was thinkin to right this i went and looked at the reviews and no to many Good Ones some of the pepole i know most i dont but they have fixed the charecter wipe every Update and there is suposesd to be an Update soon wich i look Ford to and the game has its Fun parts it boring parts but dont all games have those moments so as i was syaing chucklefish have done a decent amount of content but the nighly biulds just tease pepole to do it but they will lose there stuff but i am not sure if u back u client up it wont delde the files but lets leave that Trail of thought i recomend it to Play this game as a time filler or well thats ur Choice but the graphics are not the Best but its still in beta i see pontenitel in this game p s sorry for the Bad Spelling
Free and Easy Way to learn russian and other exciting Languages
this game is one of the Best games yet and it will always be im from australia and i thank Dean Hall for this fantasic game it never gets Old well done for your acomplishment well done mate
in my opinion very underated i loved it beautiful scenery and sniping was clean and rewarding to get a kill
one Heck of a game with some flaws tdu2 is unique it s sort of like Forza Horizon with Better Open World and more Realism it s Got a racing storyline with some Open World elements to allow you to explore the beautiful islands of hawaii no not Kawaii and later on in the game spoiler Ibiza it s a console Port that s mostly well done but needs some Peformance tweaks pros Good graphics very Good range of cars large and i mean large maps x 2 hidden Easter Eggs e g wrecked cars collect them all and you get a car suprisingly decent upgrade and Customisation sysem cons securom drm is complete and Utter heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit slight framerate drops Multiplayer is down quite often unplayable with a keyboard and Mouse Physics takes gettin used to no sequel as the company Has_Been disbanded
Well_There s not much to say about warframe it s Got a very very Good f2p model and it ties that together in a very well rounded package of graphics and Gameplay sure the Devs Might_Be aiming a bit High with the 200 package but for the Standard Person it s Got some Good stuff going for it
Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive is an awesome Multiplayer Shooter that s Easy to Play and Fun just about anywhere prosfun Multiple game modes mean you don t have to Play the same gamecheap can be found for Sub 10not demanding my Friend can Play this on his cheap Ultrabook with some specks of lagsteam Workshop some brilliant maps that stand out from the others cons H1 Multiplayer is laggy at timesnot much to mention really
watermelons pidgeons npcs from half Life and a bunch of props crap make Garrys_Mod yeyp s get counterstrike source it is used by Multiple game modes and maps
your Pc sure it can do everyday tasks but with every laptop and Low to moderate end desktops one question remains can it Run crysis

Good game lads

Good Fun game Worth playing
a playable game that descripes itself as a Stealth game so shouldn t your be Able to avoide the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Combat instead of locking the player in to it ever time someone hears the little Green heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit farts 4 10 a Better Buy would be dishonored or its dlc
a Bloody Good time this games is both one of the most violent and most Fun games i have played and left me wondering when i started to enjoy being an such Evil heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit the one Hit one kill machnic makes an interesting Change to the uual Health system but it is still Fun if you enjoy a Challange the Gameplay is almost that of a puzzle games as you plan out your Way through areas one of the most digustingly Fun experiences one can have with a Video game 7 10
one of my all time favorites great game full of challenging puzzles and thrilling fights aswell as a twist i never completely saw comming it has a suprisingly Fun Combat system that keeps the games Combat interesting but can get slightly boring after a while and a deeper Story on the character you are playing would Be_Nice 8 10
this game in the first 30 minutes of playing was amazing i only Got a short time to Play it due to Irl issues but this was still probably one of the Best tps shooters i Ve played in a very very long time Reason being all classes are balanced from the Word go in tdm i didn t die too often enough for me to leave and not Play it for another 2 hours but i was really enjoying it at the time the downside of the game was the Sword it s Op from the begining as soon as you get the 3rd upgrade if i was the maker or the Main editor of this game i would either a remove the swords b do a huge Nerf for them or c just allow some servers to have them and others not in replacement for what i don t know but overal i think this game gives a Pure tps experience overal thank you for releasing this and i look Forward to playing it more in the future
absolutely heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing amazing i m Loving it so farm besides the dsync but hey that happens on every game tbh i have survived 15 days on a legit server no heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit t 24 7 Day time crap and i m Loving it can t Wait till the bring out Camp Fires thanks guys keep up the Good Work vexphia Dayz name vex
i reccomend Terraria Cause you get heaps of items Armour guns etc etc etc etc etc

Holy heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit why do you not Own this game get it now
love it can t Wait til just Cause 3 Comes_Out so excited
epic game basiclly a Free Version of Counter stirke kinda
amazing game
beware this game will consume your Social Life Play at your own risk
i thought from the moment i saw the tralier this would be a Good game even after acm but this game is amazing when u dont see the Alien your wondering how long before he she it jumps out at you but when u do see it your tempted to Run dont just dont its kind of clunky and annoying in playing but it works in favour of the Gameplay as it just makes you feel even more under powered against the damn thing after and hour of Gameplay im finding i just want to keep playing its everything i hoped it would be totally Blown_Away and scared to death by the experience so Far Definity Worth Picking_Up even at full Price also being in a vent turning around and seeing it crawling straight towards you is the Scariest heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ever
i have barely even Open the game but i dont need to to say this is 1 of the Best games ever made i spent countless hours on this game in my Childhood and i never even Got past the first Park scenario because i just wanted to keep playing it 10 10now all i need game Wise is the 3d Version of Frogger and Croc
this is a great game theres lots to do u can mess around with the Main campaign for a while and if u need a rest you can go on 1 of many side Missions time trials etc great part of this game is thers no class Lock at the start of the game u get to choose between 4 or so classes after which u will get your guns for that class in the tutorial but as soon as thats Ended you can find and use any Weapon from any class and use it as much as u want you can even equip 2 of the same Weapon as primary and secondarythis is an Online mmorpg but if your worried about geeting somewhere in the game only to be killed but another player dont worry pvp in this game isnt forced you can interact and team up with other players other Wise if u want pvp you can Approach some1 and have a Duel or you cango find a Siege which makes players Battle it out in tdm styled Gameplay but all pvp is opt in onlyfor 10 this game is well Worth it
great Action Adventure game which is based around when Lara was Young this Story is what makes her the Hard Core survivalist we see in the other games and Movies after getting through half the campaign you start to wonder how much more she can take and how long has the game Got to end but after an amount of Gameplay time and concentration you will gather the whole Story which is quite interesting after 13 hours played i am at about 75 of the Way through although i keep going back and gaining every collectible i definatly recommend buying this as it is a great game with an awesome storyline
great game with an epic campaign a bit short but well Worth it definitely recommend for people who love Action Adventure games and also has a bit of Problem puzzle solving Story line ends kind of suddenly but is Picked_Up in tomb Raider underworld if u like this game i also recommend getting the rest of the trilogy tomb Raider Anniversary and tomb Raider underworld
awesome game
its addicting
really Fun with friends and Free so gete it
alot of Fun and content
Terrible game probs go Cut for Beiber now aye
Best game every created a Must_Have
adrenaline rushing
this is one of the Best games i have played in a long time definitely recommend this to any one
Play this game its amazing
really Good game
i would like to start this Review with a disclaimer this is one of the Best shooters i Ve played in a very long time i couldn t name for you the last time i had this much Fun with a Shooter the Gun Play is Crisp and responsive the Level design is beautiful and Intelligent and the refreshing return of objective based and team Play oriented Combat gives every Action you perform and kill you execute out feel meaningful to the overall outcome of the game however i can not recommend this game in it s current form this is almost entirely due to the Business model of the game for those unaware of it who don t want a long winded explanation i shall attempt to keep it brief so you have 2 Main aspects to the game s Business model Cards crates and Mercs the Mercs are on a Weekly rotation of 3 and week as of writing this Review this is already too little to have on rotation the Mercs all have differing Play styles and unique Personality however i believe that individual Mercs are Far too expensive they can to anywhere from 10 to 15 at one Point which is almost as much as you would have paid to get into the Closed_Beta testing the other aspect being the Cards cases is also rather unfair each case contains a guaranteed Card and costs 1 00 in game Cash this is already pretty expensive the credits are quite Hard to earn and the cases will almost never yield a worthwhile Card something is to be said for the unavailability of credits as a real money Purchase as of writing this Review but i would Bet my bottom dollar that this is only temporary it is also extremely expensive to Trade up Merc Cards both in lower tier Cards and in credits making it an in viable option by Certain points in the game now i love splash damage and i believe they are an extremely tallented Developer who put their hearts into projects i loved enemy Territory to bits i thought Brink was an extremely underrated game and i found the Batman_Arkham Origins Multiplier rather enjoyable if a bit rushed however consumers can not excuse a game of unfair Business models with the defense of its game Play the Saddest thing about this is that i do not believe this is entirely splash damage s Fault instead i Point a hesitant Finger at Nexon the publishers of the title do not forget readers that they might have a larger hand in this issue than you might think so in Summary fix your Business model then we Ll talk
possibly one of the greatest games of the Generation and the only game i Won t ever regret pumping nearly three years into the engaging Combat system reminisent to ocarina of time is satisfying brutal and not without its problems some of these problems include cheesing pvp with the use of backstabs and many of the deeper nuances not Explained by the game at all the game also boasts a subtle yet epic Story using item descriptions and character dialoge as the only sorces however this is not a Bad thing as it compels you to be more active and thaughtful in and out of the game to this Day all i can do with my friends is argue about things like the godess velka and the chronology and the events the game s predicesors and the upcoming sequel the game also has a very large and active Community as people argue about lore Hold pvp turnaments etc it is also exceedingly emersive with briliant Voice acting Gorgeous sound assets and a Musical score that will leave you in awe make you cry and make you heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit yourself all at the same time however before Purchasing this Masterpiece you Must_Be aware of the plathera of problems it Holds some of these are Low texture Quality Low screen Resolution 30fps Lock almost unusable with a keyboard and Mouse extreme frame drops and a staggering amount of bugs however all of these problems can be fixed with the multitude of mods available for Pc praise the Sun
Best Rush b Simulator until today10 10 ign Ez pz Gg Wp
do you like simple Easy to learn games wellthis game probably Isn t for you unless you re into Learning alot of Sh t in the game machinecraft looks nice and is nice but in the first hour of playing you will go why Won t this Work then you Play for another few hourse then go how do i make this Work then you Hit the 10 hour Mark after 10 Hrs of playing you can now make simple machines like a car after 50 Hrs you make your first Plane after a few 100 failed attempts on how to make and fly one ofcourse then the 100 hr Mark and you can now make comples stuff but Theyre not so polished then the 200 hr Mark which i have Currently you make your first insert a unique type of machine here after that you now realise that you could Ve done something with your Life with the 200 hours you spent in the game the game is proud of you you your friends your Family not so much
you just Point and shoot its something
would be Better if they add npcs and quests for the npcs other Wise itll just be the same repetetive thing
i played it since it was unturned now its unturned go still Worth playing
mlg 420 blaze it feggt
Good game gets repetetive when you put some hours into it but Good for item trading like spiral Knights crowns for Tf2 items
this is really Fun
great Fun once you Learnt how to Play definitely recommend it for its Price especially when on sale
very Fast paced the game starts to Open up and is Very enjoyable after the Steep Learning curve
fairly well optimised Good Port for Pc singleplayer is Ok for passing some time though the strike Force Missions are Terrible Multiplayer does not have many players incredibly difficult to find a Match which is not team deathmatch which is more of the same if you have played the Multiplayer of the previous call of Duties zombies is great Fun but just about nobody playing around the australian area if you really enjoy call of Duty games and have enjoyed the last couple of them then this game is mostly a Better Purchase than Cod ghosts but if you are sceptical about this Purchase then there are many other games which would be a Better Purchase
i Have_Been playing this game for such a long time that i don t even remember when i started playing it the game is Fun and it is simple 2d grafics the soundtrack is great and the game has several Different heroes to Play it with all kinds of gameplays the Reason i chose this game was because my Pc is quiet Old and slow so i can t Play games more sophisticated but it has some serious issues like lag and rage quit players that can t Destroy the Fun of playing it the game doesn t have a official host so players must host the matches and that is quiet Terrible since some players don t have Good conexions to host it you can quit a Match whenever you want without punishment which i think it is a Problem that the creators must solve as Fast as they can i Ll not recomend the game since those two issues are quiet Bad for an Online game but if you don t mind for lag players or rage quit i can say for sure you will have some Fun playing it Ps sorry for my Bad english
just Buy it and Play this Mother heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing game awesome jesus Christ

i dont know why but i like games i sucks at
the only game where a Box can make someone lose
you can Crash a spaceship into a bace this game is Bloody awsome
no don t even bother
i would Pay full Price for this game very satisfying Hack and slash Action game 9 10
first off this game has faced much scrunity and more often than not these people have jumped on the let s all hate this game for no Reason Wagon this game is rewarding as it is satisfying and enjoyable and will definitely scratch that lotr itch that you have some parts are tedious and bland yes but what game doesn t have it s boring moments edit the Nemesis system becomes so heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing stupid after a while took me 4 hours to kill one warchief
first of all 10 10 i have never played a game that has made Me_Feel as much as telltale s the walking Dead it is often iterated in many reviews but each Decision really matters not only for the consequences for your choices but for the emotions you Ll feel whether that be Sheer Joy Relief hate or regret and regret is really what makes this game so enthralling you can actually make a Decision in a Video game you Ll regret you Ll often think to yourself this character didn t have to go through this or didn t have to die if i just made this Decision differently i Promise you you Ll never put the game down once you begin Update the ending made me cry like a Baby
kingdoms of amalur the reckoning is a very vibrant detailed and content filled Action rpg although a few primative features make it frustrating at times such as no auto save functio this is a very satisfying Open World Fantasy experience that will keep you playing each side Quest somehow feels intertwinned to the Main Story which is great because it never feels like it s wasting your time the upgrading system is quite excellent although it is possible to become over powered very quickly if you choose to Focus on one skill set e g might where you can Hack a Troll to death in a few swings the Combat is satisfying not too Fast or too slow and in most cases you can t just Button mash you must use a Variety of Weapons Magic and techniques to overwhelm your Foe and that s why i purchased this game for a satisfying and rewarding Hack and slash experience
by Far the most relaxing game money can Buy 10 10
this game surely will go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time on Equal Par with Half_Life_2 if not Better yes this game is that Good what are you even doing down here add to cart Buy it and Play it
boring
Got Ta go Fast if i had a dollar for every hour of my Childhood i wasted Feeding my Chao drugs that i Got from destroying Robots i d be a very very Rich Garden gnome
i Ve Owned this game since preorder and i m still highly amused by the terrorist character dude with the Water bottle in his backpack seriously though it s a highly enjoyable experience that s the same as all the other games in the series but without the obnoxious Pricetag of that other repetitive mainstream fps one of my all time Favourite games and i have to pretend to be offline all the time so people think i have a Life
this joins Iron Ore as one of poland s Notable exports my Favourite part was the part where you shoot Robots

at first this game seemed like just another puzzel game but as i emerged myself into the atmoshphere of Limbo it was a very deep game the use of the Black and White negative Space artwork defines this game this is truely a unique and excelent game towards the end of the game the puzzels almost seemed impossible a masterpeice of a game with its one of a kind artstyle combined with the Physics and puzzels it has no trouble defining its Self from any other game definatle one of the Best games i have played 11 10it is truely an imersifying game
pay2day global offensive
brilliant Multiplayer just a Shame that nobody ever plays it
whoever says the communit is Bad heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit them this game is amazing and its full of awesome heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing people
Best metalest game ever
great look great Mechanics all in all great game but to really experience it to is full potential Play competitive causal is just full of hackers and is really imbalanced if you just started playing you Ll get killed every 5 seconds
i Ve been playing unturned for a short period of time but i have to say that it is looking very promising as i Ve only played the Free Version of the game i m yet to see the features that are available when playing the Premium Version when you first Open the game you re given the Opportunity to create a character there are a Variety of Customisation options available however some of which are only unlocked with the Premium Version of the game once passed the character Customisation stage which can be edited later anyway you can choose between a singleplayer Multiplayer and tutorial option being a man that likes to learn for himself i reframed from playing the tutorial but for the sake of reviewing unturned i did the tutorial gives you a basic rundown of the Controls Movement Combat and driving simple but helpful then i decided to jump straight onto singleplayer unturned gives you two options of maps to Play on Pei which is your basic Post Apocalyptic Map with buildings and Towns and Arena a difficult Map which places you in an Arena like area with nothing but the Forest around you i decided to Play on the Pei Map first once spawned i realised that you start off with nothing and i literally mean nothing you dont even spawn with clothes on the spawning in unturned is Random so i was spawned near a walled off area which i later found was a Military Base i fought my Way through the Base and gathered a few supplies including a backpack handgun and suppresor and a Map of the whole of Pei while in this Menu i discovered a skills Menu which can be upgraded by earning eperience though killing zombies and a crafting Menu which didnt make sense to me so i decided to leave it be judging from the Map it seemed that Pei was a large Scale Map that had many places to visit so i decided to visit the local Town once i arrived i was greeted by a large horde of zombies i managed to pick off 5 of them with my handgun but i ran out of ammo and had to Run for about 5 minutes before running upstairs into a House and Dying because i Got stuck in the tub this is the Point where i decided i was Bad at Video games and also decided to Play on the other Ma Arena once loaded it spawned me into an Arena like area the areanwas surrounded by Water Ans there were tall rocks around me vaguely resembling Stone Henge and some supplies however due to the small inventory Space i could only Carry a small Knife and three seed which i planted soon after i decided to Venture out into the Woods and i quickly Got lost my hunger and thirst Bars needed tending to so i decided to Hunt some animals and quickly realised that the pigs i was chasing were very Fast or that my player spent too much time writing a pointless Review of a game that nobody will ever read so he gained a substancial amount of weight and decided not to go outside anymore i soon realised that the only Way to satisfy these meters was to travel back to the spawn and Harvest the seeds i planted earlier but i unsucessfully did so and died trying to find which Way i came from then i decided to Try out the Multiplayer secion of the game but was unable to do so because i have no friends unturned is a great game however i do feel that playing with friends would give you a much Different and Better experience in contrast to playing by yourself unturned feels like a very basic Version of Dayz or games similar to this and this is not a Bad thing unturned gives you a similar experience to these games but it expresses itself in a much Different Way this is mainly Bue to the blocky artstyle of the game which much resembles games like roblox and Minecraft unturned is the type of game that you could let your 7 year Old Brother Play without getting into trouble by your mum for letting him Play a violent Video game but can still be played by the older demographic just the same to summarise this Review i reccomed this game to anyone however get some friends Whip up a server and Play together and you Ll have a much Better experience do i see potential in this game yes i do so long as the developers continue to Work Hard and listen to The_Community and take their ideas on boards as well as Their_Own give unturned a Try you wont be let down
real nice game used to Play it when i was in primary School Perma death Feature is cool and loot can be Saved aswell
my dream of becoming Bear grylls has finally Come true
amassed Army of Rock throwing farmers then took on the enite Kingdom 10 10
yeah there is bugs and crashes and Random Deaths but who cares i can poison people with disinfectant spray this is an absolute Must_Have for anyone who likes Post Apocalyptic Survival games
this may be the greatest game in existence despite its many bugs and glitches it is a great game hundreds of hours of Fun even with the amount of time i Ve put into this game i Ve barely scratched the surface and most of that has Come solely from the Level editor the editor is really Fun to Play around with Helicopter raids Tank Missions Halo jumps patrols ambushes you name it you can More_Than likely do it the only real Problem you might encounter with this game is its difficulty there is a pretty Steep Learning curve to get used to it theres no second lives theres no Attack Dog bonuses it is probably as Close as you Ll ever get to War i wouldn t recommend this to any looking for a Quick Cod Style deathmatch Arma Ii s Combat takes patience Practice and more patience a definate must Buy for anyone looking for some large Scale warfare Tactical Combat or Military simulation games
this game how do i put it its like what you would expect a 3d browser game made on adboe shockwave to be like there s nothing here its not Worth it even if it was Free
first i Ll List my problems with this game theres no ingame tutorial i didn t know what to do with myself when i first played this it should be explaining as you go what to do and how to do it instead it gives you the option to pause the game and watch some 20 Minute videos on the steam forums that is so stupid just explain to me what to do when i m playing the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit thing there is really nothing to do you can build massive ships and some pretty Cool_Stuff but what after that just fly around aimlessly the Controls are so Bad it isnt funny you Press t to interact with objects to Press buttons get in ships etc why t is all the over the other side of the keyboard why would they make one of the most used actions in the game in such an awkward spot there is 2 jump buttons for some Reason Space and f why did f have to be a jump Button why not Get_Rid of that stupid t and replace it with f and just leave Space to jump and Guess what you can t Change the Controls when Flying ships up is up and down is down this takes a while to get used to especially when you Ve played alot of other Flight simulators where up is down and down is up to make it even worse theres no invert look option solely for ships you can either have it on or off meaning looking will be inverted when you re on foot to everything is so Slippery you have a jetpack and its so awkward to manouver yourself moving Forward makes you Tip to the side and Flip Upside_Down while the camera Gets_Stuck and you cant see what youre doing the ships arent very Clear on how to operate them interact with them you see a massive yellow Circle sort of thing attached to the bottom of it so it only makes sense to Try and Enter the ship that Way no you have to go over to the dull Grey cockpit with no obvious markings to show you Enter there and that concludes my Review its boring no tutorial and the most pathetic Controls i Ve Ever_Seen
the game is just bah one of my major problems with this game is the fact that you walk Soo slowly they give you Big Forest but expect you to take 6 hours to get around the headbob gives me a headache and there is no option to reduce it or turn it off what were they thinking who shakes that much when you are walking so slowly anyway the game is pretty scary but slenderman doesn t really jump out at you much he sort of just watches you well that is only in the first couple of episodes before i had to take a break and rest my Eyes just don t Buy this game
i really like the game but i couldn ' t find the stupid cake
great game amazing graphics and Soo much Better when played with Add_Ons
at first it was Good but now it giving me a bunch of 300 ping servers where the f k are the australian servers going in less then 2 days

heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit in heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit
am i seriously missing something here i m not having a whole ton of Fun with game tons of bugs and glitches everywhere really Bad Performance issues there is no tutorial or anything to Help you well you wont really need any Help because all your gon na be doing through the whole game is Picking_Up Keys and unlocking doors where is the Variety guys c Mon the maps are decent but not too special and how Come being a monster just really sucks you would think that you would feel pretty cool being a monster but in this game you feel so cheap and pathetic i was hoping you could do many cool things as a monster like trigger things make people hallucinate and like fly around and drop in right behind a dude and scare the Living daylights out of him but no you can t do that well atleast from my playthroughs i couldn t as a monster in this game you Run around the area searching for people for hours and hours and hitting them then in one Hit they re Dead very misleading i wasn t frightened one bit in this game the only thing i could say that scared me much was the freaking music that plays when a Person is running away from you while your the monster it just suddenly Pops in scaring the bajeezus outta you but one Poor Decision that i hate in this game is that when your the Lurker you can t see anybody until you manifest i find it very stupid but some people might disagree with me only my opinionall i can say left about this game is that the Premise of it sounds incredible but the Dev s executed it poorly i know it s in a earlier stage of Development but still feels like a very very earlier Version of the game that the Dev s should only have please developers listen out sorry for being harsh but please Change some of these decisions that you Ve made it would definitely Change my Thoughts about this a lot Wait people till these get fixed i just can t recommend just yet

it s been almost a year now since it Has_Been released and the game is not yet optimized still there are fps lags but it can be tolerated it s quite Fun when you re playing with friends but that s about it what s really annoying is when you need to find another server to Play and right when you join your character resets to a fresh spawn zombies can walk through walls with holes smaller than them at the moment i would not recommend this game due to many bugs and glitches
Good game to Play with friends
the game is enjoyable especially when you re with friends trippy music and Lighting 9 10

great game for Free building and making friends
Play it
a bit Old now but a massive game and well Worth the money if you don t already have the game Bonus is you should be Able to get the entire set for less than the latest Blockbuster game

plot twis
game is prty heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit
this game is Worth the money its funny witty and the game always stays one step ahead of you i recommend going into this game Blind so you dont spoil anything but i highly recommend this game
10 10 the Multiplayer is gon na be great
it was about half a year ago that i first played this game and at the time it didn t really grab my attention all that much i would have to say that the first part of the first episode the only one i had played at that Point is not exactly Representative of the game as a whole it gets a Whole_Lot Better recently i acquired a Pc that could actually Play this game my first foray into the game being on an xbox 360 and i Picked_Up the game for 75 off during a steam sale and i have to say it is one of the Better games i have ever bought playing through this game is an incredible experience it continues to be as such on consecutive playthroughs but nothing can compare to that first time the choices you have to make have an incredible impact and can drastically Change how large portions of the game Play out in the end if you re a Fan of the walking Dead tv show but even more so if you are a Fan of the Comic Books then you should definitely pick this up it is an experience that will Change you Forever and i could not more highly recommend it
basically if you enjoyed Far cry 3 then you should like this game if you like the Terminator aliens Robocop or anything else 80s then you will love this game oh and by the Way Sergeant Rex power Colt is pretty much the coolest Video game protagonist of all time so there s that as well

oh what a Day what a Lovely Day to Play this game
10 10 never played dust2 before
its a Fun game to Play with friends and by yourself recommend
this game it very weird funny and extremly Fun i have enjoyed every Minute that i have played this game the only thing that i do not like is that the Campain is too short
great Fun a very diffrent but awesome it will keep you entertained for hours
this game is amazing highly recommend anyone that has played this on the consoles to get it on the Pc because it is heaps Better it runs Better there are New gamemodes and many New things that make it heaps Better Buy it
i dont recomend this game at the moment because of alot of reasons i think you are Better of waiting until it is out of Early access
one of the Best games i have Ever_Played highly recomend it i have completed the Campain and i am still playing it but a bit buggy at times
i highly recomend this game if you love off roading it is great Fun and really addictive
who ever likes Motosport should get this game
fahken planes M8
this has potential to be a Good game at the moment it is boring and repeatitive after a few hours of Gameplay also the fact that there are 3 Different classes all with Different Gameplay make for a long grind to get Better Weapons Good use of vechiles though
i opened the game and pressed tutorial Missions and they Won t load beacuse the were created in a New Version of the game even though i just downloaded it it runs really badly on my computer with a 970 16gb Ram 3 5ghz I5 procceser and the graphics look Terrible
i do not reccomend this game unless you are buying it on sale for Less than 10 Good things customizable clothes and Shields Fun Gameplay mechanicsbad things Terrible graphics you have to Buy in game hats with real Life money wtf i already i bought the game i don t want to Pay for hats you can Buy in game Weapons with real money Unfair_Advantage dlc is just a reskinned Version of the orginal gameso this game is not Worth the full Price only Buy it if it is on sale
it s very Fun but it takes a Little_Bit to get into it and understand how to Play properly
it s Fun but i finished the first Island in under and hour and Currently there are no more islands
greeat
even though the several Ad Ons to this game is very genious but when i get stuck into the game it crashes i recomend if you want to Play this game without constant crashing i recomend you Stick to cities xl platinum even though platinum crashed for some it never happened to me
my first addiction
my Childhood game defiantly recommend if it doesn t Work on a newer device you might have to tamper with your game settings the game is great for imagination and for Business Study i have played this game since i was 9 now 16 Hope you enjoy it as much as i have

i became the robot didn t get involve with the War i married a robot i have a Kid im Rich im Famous ggwp Best Story eevvrr
after playing 0 1 hour i feel like i Ve seen enough of the game s p2w Style structure that other s speak of i m amazed that a character can be unlocked for a Single game a Day or a week with less ability to do the latter inventive for taking the dark theme to a Moba but beyond that disappointing
great game engine runs smoothly even on Bad computers
although some Had_Been Change in Cs go no mp5 but for me it Got lots of Improvement and Easy for me too Play somehow Cs go need to improve is less updates would be Good for people who limited on internet usage after all Good games

very Good game for what can be achived when you are giving goverment grants to Help developers fully realise they haVe amazing skill and potental to create a visually impressiVe game while not the Cream of the Crop of Tower defence games it s pretty damn Close for what it is and there is quite an amount of detail which feels alot more RIRE than alot of other games you can tell they put quite alot of loVe and houmor into it and for that i think it s Work giving a bash if you injoy Tower defence games
this game is amazing just simply amazing

i shot a midget with an electrified revolver and his Head exploded 10 10 would fight midgets again
this game made my New Life goal to Massacre all rabbits in as gory a Way as possible 10 10 also its a great sandbox game with very Fun fleshed out Mechanics and an extremely vibrant art Style
zombies everyone loves zombies which is why truely inspirational spiritual journeys such as Counter strike Nexon zombies exist with mind bogglingly strong Boxes you Ll be Holding down left Mouse click for hours at a time you might think this is a boring or mundane Concept however with the literal piles of zombies swarming you constantly said mechanic becomes truely delightful Counter strike Nexon zombies also has Majestic Boss battles with Original Mechanics like constantly Insta killing you and knocking your Weapon out of your Hands Mechanics like these show that the Video game Franchise as a whole as grown and ascended past it s 8 bit era

great game very Fast paced and addictive Gameplay chanracter models might not be your thing but then again it s refreshing to have a female cast that Isn t over sexualised like Crazy definately recommend if you enjoy Fast pased Shoot_Em_Up Style games
if you liked titain Quest you Ll love this
if you liked Limbo you Ll love this same Mechanics with a much more ominous theme would definately reccommed
Hands down the most broken Port i Ve Ever_Played the Reason steam strongly recomends a controler is because none of the icons Have_Been changed for Pc and the keyboard layout is terriable i had to download a Mod to get it to Play at the right resoloution and it doesn t screen tear to heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit also on Windows 8 it still runs of games for Windows i need another Mod to fix that almost nothing Has_Been optimised for Pc wish i d spent the Extra Cash and Got Dark_Souls 2 instead
wow great game

10 10 it s okay
walking Simulator 2014
great game
Gud game
amazing love the Different aspects of Theis game the developers realy make you think about how you are going to plan the traps for the Night to give you an Edge over the monsters and i love the fact that they make you Pay dearly if you have misplaced a Trap or a Bait and you will have to Mak do with your Axe also making the Main character waeker than the enimies is a great idea it realy makes you think that if you have to use hand to hand Combat or in this instance Axe to claw you have to use every thing you can to get an advantag from using your musket making an attmept with your Axe or even luring your enemies to a Trap that hasent been used also i love that you realy have to use anything to put Distance between an Army of werewolves and yourself and bonfires are the Best to do so because if you think that if just yur Axe will get you through the Night your are wrong and having the buildins to protect is a great idea it makes the Night less about making sure that the character lives and more about making sure the builds survive all in all Sang Froid tales of werewolves one of the Best stratagies Action games i have Ever_Played Hope they release a sequal Remeber this is tome 1
simply put amazing greatest game i have played this year the nemisis system is so facinating how you can make a enemy just by thinking that you have killed someone or they may have killed you they are not bosses that are in a set place they move around the World and you could just bump into them or they might Try and find you to get revenge amazing Story that Got me right in the feels also great Level design theirs something about wandering around Mordor that makes you feel at the Center of the middle earth Universe great charchter devolpment and im looking Forward to the dlc to learn more about celebrimbors Story
microtransactions
Kv 8 sunk itself with Flamethrower 10 10 would Flamethrower Ice again
so many bugs in this game but i would recommend this to anyone who likes the Old Arma 2 Dayz
great game to Play with friends with many ways to go about playing it go in guns blazing or get in and out without the cops even knowing you were there it all depends on your team and skill but even the smallest Mistake such as not answering a guards pager can mess your plan up entirely with a vast range of Weapons customizable masks body armours and Gear this game is definitely Worth trying if you enjoy intense Gun fights and smash and grab scenarios
the irony is to Buy for definetly Worth getting especially if you like sexy outfit dlc i would give it a 9 out of dlc required
one of the Better written Modern Military shooters of the past 5 7 years you will do questionable actions in this game while playing as the protagonist these actions have a profound effect on the protagonist squadmates and yourself Spec Ops the line focuses on the horrors of War something that has not been focused on by other Military shooters over the past few years
probably one of the most difficult games ever created love every Single aspect of it Worth the frustration 100

heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing Sweet 10
the both the Gameplay for the campaign Map and realtime battles are incredibly detailed and Entertaining to both Command and watch besides some bugs in the beginning this rome 2 is a well crafted game
Wolfenstein the New order is a fantastic game and well Worth the Purchase the Gameplay manages to Immerse you into the World along with well thought out Weapons and beautiful scenes makes the game Shine only one Problem is that i have found the Hardest Level Uber easier than i had expected other than that great game
howdoyougetgold
yes Best game ever
very Fast Action first Person Shooter just pick a Gun and you re off no Story or cutscenes etc Robots just keep coming harder and faster and bigger while you improVe your weaponry and features Control and Gameplay are excellent though still lacking in Movement options like all fps games these days can t moVe much while shooting can t Sprint and strafe Weapon options are quite Good you start with a Choice of shotty assault Rifle Battle Rifle and the weaponry builds from there the middle tier Weapon options could include a true auto smg but it Ll get there i m sure the shotguns seem Op anyway jump in grab a Gun shoot until you die
i m enjoying this game quite a bit both Single and co Op modes this is mainly because no one can Beat my top scores that s right heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Es no one heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Es
this game is assassin s Creed Mordor but it seems less repetitive and predictable not a huge Fan of Ac here and because it s set in middle earth it s much much Cooler
this game was amongst the Best i Ve Ever_Played the Gun Play was Good with enjoyable Mechanics Stealth was Easy to understand and made sense the storyline was really fantastic in my opinion and while it didn t have any huge twists it was clearly very High Quality not as Open World as i was expecting the Story does urge you on quicktime events not too common but in my opinion could still be used even less
pros adds in epic Elite Guard type units in campaign and Custom battles gives you special units like Frie Korps and adds in elitie Cavalry units lets you Destroy vanilla line Infantry in multiplayercons most all the Elite Guard type units have a unit Cap of 1 Elite Guard units are Hard to get in campaignoverall 8 10pretty much just a small dlc that gives you 14 cool Extra units you most likely Got this when you bought the game Retail like i did if this sounds cool to you then get it if you want something more don t Buy it then complain about how its not what you wanted and please read the Description
pretty much if you re a Star wars Fan that wants a game that enables you to customize and upgrade your character explore lots of worlds and slice shoot Blow_Up stab and electricute your enemies but one that Dosen t have all this nonsense like in Star wars Knights of the Old Republic which is still a great game eg no jumping stupid Point and click Combat system etc then this is the game for you also if you like this game then get Star wars jedi Knight Ii outcast it pretty much has the same look feel to it as this one only no customizing also you don t need a Good computer to Run this game it was made in like 2003 get this game
this is overall one of the Better western games i have played and has a Good upgrading system great Physics somewhat destroyable Environment and Good firefighting but the one thing i didn t like about this game was the guns the guns in this game are excellent to use and High detail but as the game moves foward in time i felt like i was missing out on all the New weaponary of the time like in the year 1910 for example people still used all the Old guns in real Life but there were tons of New Ones peope used as well and i have listed some that should Have_Been there or can maybe be there for the next game you should look them up bolt Action rifes m1903 Springfield from 1900 onwards not realistic but almost all the guns are anachronistic m1892 Krag Jorgensen Rifle from 1890 onwardssemi automatic pistols Mauser c96 from 1895 onwards not realistic but almost all the guns are anachronistic besides the Gun 1896 one year later Colt m1900 m1902 from 1900 1902 model is almost identical Double Action revolvers Colt m1877 from 1877 onwards besides John Wesley Hardin used this Gun Colt 1892 38 revolveryeah thats it i give this game 8 9 10 if the next game gets these guns and mabye a bit of Open worldish feel like the older Ones then Ill give it 12 10
fantastic Physics fantastic mods fantastic gamethis game is seriously the Best game ever i own a lot of games that aren t on steam as well if you don t own this game i feel sorry for you11 10 also be sure to get Half_Life_2 episode 2 and Counter strike source as some content on the Workshop requires these games
this game is absolutely Worth whatever money you are paying forduring your time here you will be sent to time where swords and bows wereDear Esther is not a game by any means other than using the wasd Keys to move and the Mouse to look it has no other similarities it is however a New kind of Book allowing you to take your time looking around the Island while the exquisite narration unfolds a Story hinted to by the scenery as with all my Books i m taking my time and Haven t yet made it to the end if this sounds interesting to you i d recommend taking your time with it one Technical addition as you re not running around with 30 other users blowing things up the pull on your resources Isn t as much so assuming your system Can_Handle it you can crank everything up to Max and enjoy the scenery even more
love this game and if you dont have this game yet then what are you waiting for
this game is so addictive if you like this game Play hand of Fate
movie was Good and so was this
very Good
yes get it now
i tried i tried liking this game i really did i knew it was Cod or battlefield i knew it worked differently but when that differnece seems to Change Match to Match i just can t how someone can for a Distance with a automatic Weapon get me in the Head and instanly kill me yet when i have a shotgun Point Blank at an afks Head and still not Kill_Them it s just not Fun and the Comunity my God the only worse one i Ve found is leauge of legends and only Becuase they were just spiteful of me never having played before rather then helped or even orded me around in this game it s just Alah ackbar shouted through the mics by people who sound like they aren t Old enough legitimently have steam accounts i Ve had one game where the people were nice and the game was Fun and even though i had pretty much the same k d ratio i was still a Help Yo the team and they helpped back i don t know what the competitive side of this game is like and i was going to maybe give the Mode a go when i learnt how to Play a bit more but i Haven t been Able to learn the experience is so inconsistent i just have no idea how anything works the Weapons i get killed by the most the awp and ak47 two guns that just don t Work like they should and i can t figure out what other are doing at the end of every Match you can type things to the other team but all i Ve seen is insults and agression and that s not Fun i can see people who are top notch proffesionals sometimes not having Fun while playing bacause it can sometimes be a Job to them but when it seems you need to put Job like hours into a game on a casual Scale to start enjoying it it s just an unsatifing experience 250 matches and i Ve leveled up once the grind and climb shouldn t be that Steep so soon imma give it one more go maybe in a week or two i m Burnt out of it for now one last go to have Fun or it s gon na Stop taking up Space on my computer

a simulation of manslaughter murder Violence Self defence agravated assault and grevious Bodily Harm i am honoured i had the chance to Play such an accurate reflection of what it is like to be in a bar fight i recomend that the developers consider implementing the following Golf Course Map shopping Mall Map Jersey Shore Style hardcore nightclub Map Hockey stadium Map Workshop no in game purchases please Beach Map Party Map Pool Party Map School mapi am aware that the developers have predicted Online co Op in Early January 2016 i highly recommend buying this game if you wish to vent some built up anger or simpily love Gore like me this game has so much potential i have a sense of Trust for those developing such a masterpeice the Devs should be proud 7 10

amazing game love it
so addicting a Must_Have game
this is a game where scantily women and Old men in robot suits can Battle it out to the death in a server that pings every 3 seconds 420 Stars out of meme
this is a game where you Run around spamming your Mouse for 2 hours straight and then you get teleported to some Castle thing and then you die and lose all your stuff repeat
it is the Goods
the fantastic thing about Ultimate Chicken Horse is that you don t even have to be Good at it in order for it to be hilarious Fun if you have even one Friend to Play with in local Multiplayer i can only recommend local Multiplayer since that s been my only experience so Far with the game and you can both Laugh at your Own absurd and No_Doubt plentiful virtual demises then this is a game you Owe it to yourself to at least Try don t forget you can refund any game for any Reason if you Ve Owned it for under 2 Weeks and played under 2 hours i already feel that i Ve had my money s Worth from this game and those i Ve played with fully agree my Fellow players and i have discussed the game and we agree heartily on its Quality Ultimate Chicken Horse is accessible to gamers of most skill levels some basic platforming experience helps is Thoroughly amusing light hearted and Fun or hey you could Play it seriously Hold a Tournament it s very flexible plays smoothly employs simple Controls is Quick to learn features some surprising depth and creativity in combining objects and game Mechanics the Honey especially in combination with moving objects is my Favourite part of the game has an enjoyable and fitting soundtrack contains only a few Minor issues which only occasionally detract from the experience has a cute Style of animation and cute voices for all the playable animals features a simple well paced progression system with the important parts New levels and characters unlocking Early and the Fun little bits clothes accessories unlocking later uses a Clear Cut and simple Scoring system that requires little explanation if any as most of it can be understood simply by Learning through Play can be enjoyable even for less experienced players if you re not Hung up on the goal of winning and just like having Fun it doesn t matter if you don t often Come out on top watching others yelp and Holler as they navigate a devious stage is half the Fun is Thoroughly Spectator Friendly should probably be in your steam Library by now
only played a few hours partly solo partly with my Brother and a Friend already Got my money s Worth i imagine it will be quite some time before another game Captures the spirit of Giant_Robot battles in Space anime as well as this one has
Blast from the past one of the bests
it s like League but harder
bought this game a couple of years ago now steadily played through every Update enjoying every New Feature implemented and every bug eradicated really great developers who have provided a supremely Quality product ludeon set the benchmark for what a game should be congrats on your addition to steam this is one of the few Indie games on the market here that Truly deserve to be here 10 10
great game for excercising your brain and micromanaging skills however the ai leaves a little to be desired with their extremely one sided Trade offers and tendancy to denounce you whenever you lift a Finger against another civ including civs that they are also Currently fighting or even to defend your own empire
interesting game wished it was longer it was over so Quick the re playability is limited to how Hard it is not much rewards and Dante himself has anoying one liners other than that it plays the same as past dmc games suggest a Controller Cause keybourd is a weird setup
fans of Horror and fnaf will love this game obviously though it is a little 2 spooky 4 me highly recommended to people who are interested in Horror
i Ve only played a sliver of xcom ayylmao unknown and Holy heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit it is some top teir heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ayy lmao takes what makes turn based Good and makes it brilliant which is pretty incredibly because i hate turnbased i can t recommend this game enough
like all games Ziggurat has its problems these are at the Core the fact that levels in and of themselves aren t the most well designed things and that the music Isn t really that great but the problems are overshadowed by what this game does right this game perfectly brings the Concept of a roguelite to the first Person Shooter genre having some of the Best visuals and gameplays out there all of this is done in a dark comedic and cartoonish Way that will have you constantly switching Weapons sprinting jumping and varying between fire modes constantly atop this it manages to massively improve on roguelite Concepts by giving you choices in character leveling by letting you choose between a pair of Random perks with each Level while the game contains Perma death each time you die or progress further you will unlock New Equipment overall this is Hands down the greatest game to Reach an official release this year being almost glitch Free and containing mountains of content it is an absolute must Play for any rogue Lite rpg or fps Fan the Devs are so confident you will love it they simply show Gameplay for the trailers if that Isn t product confidence i don t know what is
Fun he he he
seriously not Bad Harder_Than required without igp but with careful Play even us 5 00 Worth of crowns can give you that Kick_Start in the southern Hemisphere i d adviSe loggin in at least twice a Day Action happens while we sleep and players in europe and Usa Far exceed australian and New Zealand Pacific Rim Se Asia players so basically you Snooze and you Ll probably be obliterated and don t take time out as the game runs in real time Fail to log in for two or three days and you Ll be reading the chapter on what happens if i loSe my Village Ans makes it harder to Win cheap and Entertaining for Rts players Reminds_Me of Age of empires Ii
this has Got to be one of the Best racers i Ve Ever_Played 3 i only ever originally played the first game and i loved it and only recently decided to give the other games a Try 2 i Got Ta say has to be not just one of the Best racing games i Ve Ever_Played but one of the Best games i Ve Ever_Played in General same with the series flatout istelf although 3 is a Pile of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit by looking at the negativity so might not Play it unless i want a full and Fair opinion of it flatout 2 is game where the races never feels too Easy like a lot of other racers and never seems to get boring with it s amount of destruction and intensity it has
awweh s cute
might as well download a Private server Cause dis heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit is confusing as hell but its alright RIRE
pretty Fun just takes a long heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit time to load in unless you Got it on an ssd
the Best Way to be the Queen you always wanted to be with music that will get stuck in your Head and tricky Problem to solve with Multiple options this is awesome Try and die all the ways
heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit flappy goat burn that heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit to hell heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit n want to get 100 of the acheivements and the put that Pile of heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit as the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit fest of a Cherry on top other than that the game is really Good
i Have_Been playing this game since it was first released it is the most Fun Gore fest i have ever had
i Ll give you a Good idea of what will happen during the first hour of the game firstly you will Wake_Up on a Sandy Beach scratching that tiny misquito bite on your arm you look around and realise you are surrounded by a bunch of dinosaurs but don t panic not all of them are out to Eat you except for those dilos those heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit s would Eat Their_Own babies if given the chance first thing you need to do is punch a Tree yes i said punch a Tree then collect some berries to Eat oh no looks like you are thirsty go take a dive into the Water to have a drink Run away there a giant shark thing chasing you oh you just pooped it s edible but i wouldn t recommend it oh look a Dilo just killed you until you get the Hang of this game you will die a lot but it is definitely one of the most Fun games i have played in a very long time it s still in Early access so a lot of the content hasn t been implemented and there are still a lot of bugs even so there is heaps to do and the developers are amazing as they release a New Patch everyday
probably one of the Funniest things i have Ever_Played in recent memory some things like to bug out but it s these bugs which Sorta add to the Appeal of the whole game having said that though the novelty does wear off fairly quickly and you may only get a couple of hours out of the game before you start to get bored i d recommend waiting until the Workshop starts filling up with more stuff once the game is actually out on steam before buying so you can guarantee yourself hours of Fun
alright so this is coming from a Guy who doesn t necessarily not like but Isn t a Fan of traditionAl rpgs if you re doubting buying this game look how much time i Ve sunk into it it s not overly long like other rpgs i Got the normAl and true endings in a little over 12 hours Gameplay and to be quite honest i don t have the Heart to do the genocide ending but it Ll take a lot longer if you explore every nook and cranny the World now you re probably thinking gee willikers only 12 hours is this Pile of Poop really Worth tenbux my answer is simply hell heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit in yes admittedly it might take a Certain type of Person to really enjoy this game and if you re not a Fan of rpgs this game probably Isn t for you but if you re that type of Person wow Undertale is definitely a candidate for goty this game will Toy with your emotions throw curveballs at you when you least expect it probably frustrate you with a couple of fights and you will love every Single moment of it and also probably cry and definitely Laugh and even then if you re still doubting buying this Video game after reading this and the hundreds and hundreds of other positive reviews like these grab it anyway and if you don t like it get a refund from steam before you Hit the 2 hour Mark that and there s also a short demo on the officiAl Website a very Easy Way to make sure that 1 hr of Good light hearted and feel Good unless you don t want it to be Entertainment is right for you
one of the announcers runs the your text Spoken Soundcloud enough said
excellent game Easy to get intohours of Fun especially if you have a Friend playingrecommend been searching for a Easy game for a while now

i can only recommend this game if you like Fast paced games and its only Fun if your shark as a diver you will mostly Respawn then die over and over again but theres bots so it Isn t that Bad of a game

Rob bathis is a game i didn t even know i Owned until one Day when i went through my Humble bundle games and found this in there unclaimed well i installed it gave it a Try and i must say it is a strange game but quite amusing in the game you Play as tiny chasing a Guy named Big the basic Premise of the game is to get from one area to the next and the Main Way to do that is with a cutting Laser you basically carve your Way through the terrain and Hack up large rocks and Ancient ruins while trying to get your pants read underwear back from Big or were they your Grandpa s pants doesn t Really_Matter this game is Fun and very Different have a look at the videos in the Store and decide if the game is for you i didn t Pay for it directly so i m not sure if i would Pay the 10 for it i never had to consider if i wanted to Buy the game or not Big Thumbs_Up from me for this Indie game
this game was an entry in the 48hour game Challenge yes this game was made in 48 hours don t let that turn you off i Haven t had this game for long but i already love it it s like trying to perform Surgery with a Dead arm if you want a game that is impossible to Master and will leave you in stitches get Surgeon Simulator if you want to shoot Birds at pigs this is the wrong game
yes
if you are into visual novels with lots character Development and character interaction that leaves an impact than this game is not really for you but in retro spect if you are Planning on going to japan and are a Male Wink wink nudge nudge then this will Help you with things to do around the Tokyo Region and Kyoto Region with a slight romance Story to Break_Up all the travel Facts and japanese history i would recomend this to people who are interested in traveling to japan for a short period of time but not to people who are into highly thought out and developed visual novels unless you want something Quick and Easy to follow with only slight emersion i d give it about a 6 out of 10 because the romance aspect had some fairly well thought out moments and it Gave_Me a Good Insite into sight seening in Tokyo and the regions around it
saltier than a Salt mine i can t tell you how many times i Ve felt like ragequitting 9 11
wow a game that makes you think is the Best game of all and that is exactly what krillbite Studio did when they brought this game to the table for me this game seemed like an experiment a Way to make people think about how something that we see as insignificant in our everyday Life can be percieved as a subject of Philosophical debate cutting all of that sophisticated sounding stuff out just wow i started playing the game and noticed that you only had 2 options in the Menu start and exit no options no credits not even a Help Button just start and exit the game doesn t give you instructions and it doesn t hint at places it just simply asks whether you want to Play or not now for people who don t really understand how texts can Hold hidden meanings i e people who Haven t been bored out of there Life listening to shakespeare in High School or Haven t figured it out already this might seem like a 5 Minute game where they put extreme details into the animations of a fly but for the rest of the population just wow i highly recommend this for those who have about 120mb on their Pc s and just a few minutes to spare let this game stimulate those thinking parts in your normally Lazy brain and participate in an experiment that just makes you go wow
oming in at only 2 00 0 99c if you Got it on sale you have a simple funny and addictive game it s challenging while being a game that is enjoyable with anyone recommended to everyone

Bioshock infinite is the most perfect game i have Ever_Played you are instantly immersed through the Rich and soft textures and the angelic Lighting that is the beauty of the oil painting styled floating City of Columbia your immersion only deepens upon Hearing the game s soundtrack the wonderful Voice acting and the lively and interactive enrionment that surrounds you the immersion sits the player down orientates and plunges them into an incredibly Rich Story that discusse an alternate realm of 20th century America in which Post moderinism has sky rocketed however the Scientific marvels are under the Control of the Prophet who preaches a religion very similar to Christianity through his Dominion over Columbia he his created corruption in the City and a severe class division also he keeps his daughter locked away in a Tower that overlooks the City as Booker Dewitt you are tasked to Rescue the Girl from the Tower and return her to New_York to Pay your Debts however the Story goes above and beyond your Original plans and transform into a materfully crafted Journey into Self Discovery and the Liberation of a religously poltically opressed City what makes this Story so Rich and immersive is it s use of Quantam Physics String Theory as a Key plot structure String Theory explores the Fundamental forces in the World the consquences of hidden Dimensions number of Dimensions and the supersymmetry between Dimensions needless to say the context the plot the graphics the themes and the Gameplay will Leave you breathless the burial at Sea dlc is also incredible
finally a Shooter where the Focus Isn t being an un stoppable killing machine shelling everybody with democracy for Merica Spec Ops investigates what the darker side of War is such as the underlying intergrity of orders and Duty in a Mission decsions made by soldiers towards the Execution of a Success and the psychological toll of killing and navigating a War Zone as for the Gameplay the third Person Mechanics Work very well and the Combat is very Dynamic thanks to an interactive envrionment and Exceptional Friendly and hostlile ai what s unique to Spec Ops is it s Rich narrative including the dark themes explored and the fact that it s a Shooter that Isn t designed to Mow_Down waves of enemies Drive cars through Helicopters and Surviving skyscraper collapes gets a 9 10
this game will make a man Out of you
very spooky but fresh
omg like omg like omg
a lot of Fun a Shame they left it such a broken and buggy mess if i m going to Pay this much for a game i expect a working product i Ve lost hours of progress many times due to game breaking bugs
kek
amazing
first Review here bit trip Runner is an interesting game but that doesn t mean it s Good in fact it is the opposite of Good it s a rage game the only difference is that this rage game has the balls to charge you for this crap one of the Main selling points of this game is the music is it Good no the music is annoyingly repetitive although i admit it does sound Good for the first 2 levels of the game before you realise that it is practically the same thing over and over not only that but there is no other sound at all just the sounds of jumping over rocks and Trash cans also there are these powerup things that go from hyper to mega to Ultra to Extra and they make the game sound more lively each time sounds cool right wrong the music does get more lively until you get to Extra which turns the music into Low slow sounds that Break_Up your pacing and eventually leads to you losing the Level speaking of levels the Level design don t even get me started on the Level design first of all no checkpoints really i get that it is a kind of music if you could even call this music game so you wouldn t want the song to be broken up but the game is so insanely difficult that it takes More_Than 30 minutes for a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit 2 Minute Level who thought this was a Good idea also some of the powerups are in difficult to get places which is Good for a running game like this the only Problem is that some of these powerups are almost completely impossible to get one powerup involves you jumping down a Hole then springing back up the Problem here is that the spring throws you into a Wall which of Course kills you instantly so the Rating is probably what you want to see from this Random Guy on the internet 2 10 not recommended to all who wish to keep their sanity
at least they didn t release the same game sell it at full Price and add riptide on the end oh Wait
you can be a Space Ninja

civilization 4 is the last to really the last Edition that remains true to the traditional civ formula it adds the additional element of religions which creates an interesting Gameplay as you Try to convert other civilisations to the religion you found so that you can make more money it s also great that leonary Nimoy has Lent his Voice for the Technology and wonder achievements
always a Rush
been playing since the 1 4 Patch of Dayz so you Ll know this is coming from a Dayz Fan at Heart when Rocket promised and informed us about standalone we all cheered what s more he said it Ll be done by 2012 christmast we were kind of sad when chrismast time passed and the standalone was no where to be seen several months later both Good and Bad things surfaced warz being released and Ofc the Final Development Cycle of standalone everyone thought it would Come out 2014 and out of no where the game appeared on steam s Early Acess i instantly bought it and theres something i have to say it s really Alpha so Early into Alpha that the game is poorly opitimized no Anti hacks Have_Been implemented and glitches galore that being said there are some redeeming factors it s absolute Fun fun to the Point where i don t Care anymore if i died from a glitch ironically because this game s loot is so unbalanced that you can Gear yourself up in 10 minutes looting is Soo much Fun being a veteran in Dayz usually mean Surviving for Weeks and always go for High Value loot buildings even though it s the same mapandsame Premise i m actually looting houses for Food it was Worth my money thats all that matters
Waste of money nothing else

Fun game to Play with or without friends
this game makes me despair for Free 2 Play games i don t bother playing another Minute if you want to Play this which i did you will when playing on servers be constantly kicked for suspected cheating when you don t even have a Single line of Code for a Hack and from what i hear it is highly Pay 2 Win but don t Trust me saying it s Pay 2 Win because i aint playing another Single millisecond of this piece of junk
this is certainly a game you could Play Day after Day after Day and once you get bored of it install a million mods
Good game but astroisgod always comes in my game and starts cheating stupid pleb
Best game i Ve playedwhen the hell is 3 Com n
absolute classic Rts fantastic Combat Mechanics great looking for its time a Good Story line and a lot of mythological detail Has_Been engrossed into a Childhood Favourite would definitely recommend the Age of mythology Age of empires franchises
its a great Survival game but still requires a lot of Work for Mac as it has many Performance issues
i love this game except the Mac Port beside that this is one of the Best games i have Ever_Played download right now
just just Cs source which was awesome but 10 times Better and the New skins and Weapons make this game even more awesome as you Try to collect them
so i Pre orded the game i was very excited but well godamn was i wrong the game was so Bad i quitted and didnt even toutch it for a few months waited for it to be fixed and now it is i played the game again and now i do feel like completing the Story and stuff after the fix i think the game jumped from a 6 10 to a 8 10i now recomend this game and am deep sorry if you also Pre orded it Hope this helps
the nostalgia it Brought_Me was enough for me to Buy the game this is the most adventorous Point and click game you will find characters will stay in your mind for Weeks after you Play it the Story is very interesting i also recommend you buying the second game telling another tale which is even Better in my opinion Buy this game its Worth every Penny
swag
lost what i thought was my Best Friend to it all he does now is Csgo and it made me do so too i Ve been suffering mentally and physically now and i always wished we never played this game Tl Dr the game s addicting it made me lose someone i loved and made me lose myself it s your Choice to Play but never forget there is more to this beautiful World than Csgo
first of all this game is Gorgeous the Style is beautiful and it s well Worth taking a glance over the Horizon at any time of Day i Ve only played on the Pilgrim setting so Far the long dark s Version of an Easy setting where Wildlife doesn t Attack you and even without any Combat elements this game is incredibly Fun i get excited about finding New places Surviving is challenging but not so much that you just want to give up that said you have to be Smart i wasn t watching where i was going and Fell off a Cliff and there s no Respawn here and despite knowing i had Combat off walking down the long dark corridor at the hydroelectic plant made me a Little_Bit uneasy the atmosphere in the game in unrivaled
i honestly knew very little about this game when i bought it i knew it had a bit of a following and had Won a few Gaming Awards but that was about it i never expected this game to have the storytelling prowess and emotional power it had over me i found i couldn t Stop playing until i knew how the Story would end and i walked away from the game feeling Better for it the graphics on this game are absolutely Gorgeous the attention to detail and atmosphere staggering and the Story riveting and surprisingly Easy to relate to for anyone looking for an immersive Gaming experience or interactive storytelling i highly recommend gone home
not only is this game Flippin Gorgeous there s nothing more satisfying that shooting people in the Face and them go about their daily lives with an Arrow in their Face
i want drugs noaw
the perfect wwii strategy game
sexyness galore seriously go Buy the game if you Haven t already imagine a cinematic racing movie but you are the Main actor controlling the car on a Career to be the Best of the Best 10 10 sexy Gameplay and visuals

Space engineers is just purely awesome for a Early access game you build things in Space such as spaceships and Space stations all in your own Way in Survival you mine for resources in asteroids to create building materials Hopefully more features would Come in future updates 8 6 10

a very Good rpg game with a huge Variety of classes Weapons clothing and Powers you can combine your Powers to create even bigger and Stronger Ones and Create_Your_Own skills to styles and to finishing blows i would recommend this 9 10
love the game full of tactics but at the same time Free flowing so much Fun
while first seeing the Mixed reviews i was unsure about how this game was going to Play but with what i Ve played so Far it s an amazing game it s exploring and crafting system is quite Fun and the knowledge that the planet you re on is only one of billions is quite mind blowing i m incredibly excited to see where this game goes
great game but only one thingput this game on Mac you will get so many more people playing

dated Gameplay dated Controls Terrible Level design and the Story is Generic as anything stoped playing at the Cia Hq Level has Good visuals and Good character Modeling but thats it the Bad weighs down what little Good this game has 3 10
heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing love this
sure this game is great if your parents hate you
Fun with friends but boring on Its_Own shooting zomibes after awhile gets boring 6 10
Merry twisted
the Best na
don t Buy a lot of people are having issues with joing servers i e actually playing the game until this is fixed don t Waste your money
this is the Best Survival game i have Ever_Played not that that s saying much as i Haven t played many with most of them being Zombie based i don t think i Ve Ever_Seen a game quite like this in that it s just you in a wilderness with only your wits and some Luck to keep you alive especially considering it s an Alpha game with 6 zones and only sandbox this game looks beautiful sounds beautiful and can be both hauntingly beautiful and completely terrifying the difficulty settings are pretty Fair the easiest difficulty makes it easier to appreciate the Cold beauty and deadly serenity of the game the middle is harsh but Fair sometimes and i Haven t even looked at the most difficult all in all Best 20 i have ever spent
i Single handedly ruined City 17 in 12 hours which the rebel Army Has_Been failing for 40 years10 10 ign
have you ever asked yourself should i Blow_Up that Cat over the Road with little Rats dressed up as terrorists if no dont get this game if yes see a Doctor
in competitive i Got yelled at for firing a Gun incorrectly 10 10
it s really Good a little difficult to get into at first but Worth it amazing Tech Tree like a Spider Web i loved that when you are fighting an ai player their units are Different to yours because they have Chosen a Different path in the Tech Tree Amd graphics Card is still Producing slightly shaky graphics live in Hope that they re going to fix this one Day ironic because the game starts with an Amd splash also no score or Monument produced at the end of the game i mised that overall though Worth the money and an excellent game it Isn t Alpha Centauri Ii and it it Isn t civ Lite it s a whole New experience
totally addictive after 40 hours of playing i m still returning to Try and get those Goods to dubai on time the game starts well introducing you to small loads and Quick trips you don t realise it expanding around you as Northern europe sends Goods to the Mediterranean and north africa and then you re sending Goods to America on bigger and bigger ships just when you think you re Safe the investor comes and takes her Cut and suddenly you re scrabbling for money do you risk taken the dubious Goods for the don of Course you do you re desparate for income and Here_Comes the customs to catch and Fine you it s more challenging than it seems and building your shipping line is more satisfying than you d think it s the exact example of powerful Gameplay over expensive graphics
the Best game a lot more to do im into simulations and so Far this is the Best the New Feature woodcutting which i have had experience with in the forestry Mod for 2013 i really like the whole New Feature it does take a long time to make money but thats Life
this is the next Generation of a platformer Space travel game with a lot of Different monsters and planets
its awesome its like a gta based in the 40s 50s 60s after the wwii
no rotation on ceilings or foundations
is Good game comrades lets keep infesting servers is Good idea no Lie
Best north Korea Simulator

Hardest campaign i have Ever_Played love it
Best game made ever
Dragon demons ghost giants swords and socrery
a Franchise that has kept me playing for years and Hope the Franchise continues
i give it 7 5 10bioshock infinite like the rest of the of the Bioshock Franchise was very enjoyable to Play Combat was highly enjoyable and graphics were great however i d still say that the Original Bioshock was alot more Entertaining i was slightly disappointed that Bioshock infinite didn t live up to expectation set by developers in Early production even elements shown in the beta game Play seemed to be Non_Existent such as being fired at with artillery Weapons and having a telekinesis power to Stop the shells sandbox Level design larger and more Open areas and the Random collapse of buildings as well as Random Weather events however due to time Story and Technology restraints many of these features were unrealistic so many of this is excusable yet still leaves me mildly disspointed also i found the ending to be a bit weak but enjoyable none the less the re playability is also somewhat Non_Existent do to the Linear Level design that Isn t Present in the previous Bioshock games that would have left you searching through every Corner of the Map in the Hope that you may have missed something i still strongly recommend playing the game Good Job 2k
an all time Sci_Fi classic and a brilliant game and an epic sequel to one of the Best shooters of all time making it also one of the Best shooters of all time i could elaborate more but instead i think i Ll just say you really have to Play it if you Haven t already and if you have played it you know it s the Best
they say Variety is the spice of Life and this is what makes borderlands 2 such a Red Hot game elements such as the endless Weapon variation quirky sense of humour cartoon decor and almost comical Violence really leave a great and addicting impression of the game to players Gearbox have Truly made a Masterpiece Shooter enjoy or Buy if you Haven t already
this game is epic literally as it is really large appart from that the Gameplay Missions and graphics are excellent you could plug the hdmi Cable into your Head and just live in there away from the real World and not be bored for the next Millenia however the ability to move and shoot stuff in this game is evidence that it is a complete Rip off Halo as in Halo you can move and shoot stuff as well Clear proof RIRE
Best Free to Pay game out there and if it wasn t Free to Pay it would still be Worth buying the comical Violence and competition keeps you hooked on it like cocaine sniff
true classic Fight_Against the Zombie horde in an effort to survive with your friends my only Criticism is that this as well as the Legend of Zelda and Mario is a complete ripoff of Halo Good game
funny f2p game orginally on browser and now on steam i have no Problem with it 9 10
Meh its alright
Herro do not Buy kirring floor Veri bed Tek me to Room 1 and Chop_Chop chop Veri bed do no Buy

basically the Best game i have played since Diablo 2 Lord of destruction 13 years ago end of Story
some Guy completely destroyed my Head and i walked around as a brain hanging on by my spine 10 10

everyone on this game are heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit s they just heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit on you on first sight
spoilers Der be Mutant cannibals shh
uncharted for Pc this was the first time i had Ever_Played a tomb Raider game and i very much enjoyed my experience the game feels very reminiscent of the uncharted series on playstation and i mean that in the Best sense possible whether it be the Lovely and Complex Level design the third Person parkour and enjoyable Combat systems or the Focus on a well built plot paired with decent character Development decent Cut scenes makes the game awesome in literally every aspect Play it enjoy it and never look back
Grid 2 is certainly one of the Best racing games i Ve played in a long time the Controls feel very fluid and the graphics are great there s hardly any complaints i could make Asides from the Core components being Present and the game being built very well i Thoroughly enjoyed every Minute of the game that i played great racing game will be buying Grid 3 for sure
it s certainly a great parody of the plethora of other simulation games that are everywhere on steam and goat Simulator delivers as a Fun Quick game to Muck around in it s only a very short game and will only really provide a few hours of Fun at most but the Price tag is Representative of this fact great game to let a Friend Play and Screw around in this game delivers in being Different funny and absolutely ridiculous at times
finally the Multiplayer was given a Shake_Up to refresh an Old and long repeated system which really made this game stand out from the other 10 games in the series it s a real Shame there s hardly a Community on Pc because i would Ve sunk many more hours into this had there been an active and thriving Community
stunning art Level design decent Story polished enjoyable Gameplay solid Combat systems epic narration Complete_Package perfect Indie title
the most enjoyable first Person Shooter you will ever Play the Gameplay and Multiplayer all just feels so fluent and smooth it s competetive and simple but still Complex and challenging enough to keep you coming back for more the dlc s are also reasonable Value for money unlike what you d expect from battlefield 3 or 4 the art Style is Fun it s relaxed and not overdone with millions of attachments and Weapons to overwhelm you Vehicle Gameplay in bc2 is done right with a large Variety of vehicles to choose from which will be useful in almost every Situation imaginable this was the last battlefield game which had Truly great Level design and a decent Dog tag knifing Action grabbing someone s tags in this game means so much More_Than any other battlefield the Knife Gameplay is absolutely addictive and actually takes a reasonable amount of skill and timing unlike what you Ll find in the Luck of the draw systems which seem to be in the newer battlefield titles all in all great game 10 10
this scares me i like being scared
graphics may be a Tad dated but the sandbox Gameplay is compelling some awesome mods are availble for this game my current Favourite being diplomacy
enertaining and addictive probably the Best rogue like out there by a longshot i highly recommend it
the most brutally addictive game i Ve played since Lich King era wow the New expansion Enemy_Within adds a whole New layer of awesome though the Base game is full on enough to keep newcomers intensely occupied for countless hours so don t sweat if you can t afford the expansion straight away after nearly 7 years of full on wow this is the game that Broke its back for me
expore expolit Expand exterminate an updated Fantasy Version of the Famous 4x game civiilisation highly addictive
Better than Diablo Ii and its Free
Regular get this do that browser game nothing we havent seen before on facebook Apps
this game is absolutely Terrible now the only servers available to me at the moment are Ones with Password so there is no possible Way to just quickly join a Public server i want a refund but sadly can not get one anymore sort it out guys your game Has_Been in Development for too long now
the amount of Tim tam biscuits i can fit in my Mouth is outstanding i really like to do arts and crafts and i like the occasional Cup of Tea i enjoy Water spots and long walks with no pants on 11 10 would fap again

what can be said about this game that hasnt already been said about the Pope i have this game on console as i had to Purchase it because of this Windows 7 optimisation and later Problem on my end is i baught this on steam a long long time ago and was super excited to Play it on my Pc wich is a complete Masterpiece ps4 Pfft at the time of my Purchase there was zero notification about the Spec problems so i went on a Hunt on how to fix the issue after browsing youtube a while i Learned about the inability to actually Play i Crash every time im Born its Hard to say wether or not this game should Recieve a Thumbs_Up or down if you own a Pc with xp get it however most people dont like running a Pc on a Hamster Wheel so all in all untill betheda fix this issue this gets my Thumbs_i really want to enjoy this game and i don t mind that it s effectively a dlc for Saints Row 3 but i m rarely Able to get into game let alone Play for a couple hours and then any progress i do make goes unsaved for no apparent Reason my game will just Close to Desktop and this appears to be an issue many other people have had i Ve installed no mods and on Multiple occasions uninstalled and redownloaded the game i m using a fairly High end Pc rig so i m really doubting it s Performance issues for this Reason i really can t recommend the game i Hope that this issue is solved because it really is Fun to just mess around with all the things in the game

there s your average and overrated survivor games on steam Ark Rust don t Starve etc then there is h1z1 h1z1 takes place in a Post Zombie apocalyptict World in the normal game Mode you spawn in with some bandages a flare a few other fairly Handy tools and one objective survive buildings and cars around are deserted and you feel Very alone first thing you do look for items this can range from Weapons and tools to Food and drinks the game offers many Different challenges and allows you to craft much needed items with the right ingredients this game is much more Fun to Play with Multiple people and a microphone because Communication is the Key to survive
first time i playedhit a Tree with a rockgot killed by scrubs9 11 Best Community
would be Good if it wasn t heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit but i still Play it
in this game you can easily find Friend and enemy it was like from the beginning of the game you already can decide is your team mate is your Friend or your actual enemy but that said i have find more Friend much more Friend rather than enemy and it is one of the greatest Learning Simulator 9 10 would Play everyday to learn 100 recommended for anyone who want to get Smart
great
Finaly i was waiting for a remake
upon buying this game i had no idea about it except for the cool art Style and to be honest i was Blown_Away first off pros amazing Voice overs cool soundtrack and sound design cartoony art Style Atmospheric with their storycons Anti climatic ending fps drops i cant really talk about that laptop skrub but other people were having little issues it was originally a 8 5 9 10 until i found these very useful in finding what happenedbe warned spoilers unless you have finished the game https Ww youtube Com watch v mt0mgvl8owg and http Press start Com Au 2016 02 11 firewatch explanation and analysis so basically d or deliliah Has_Been lying to you the whole time about Ned and his Son Brian Goodwin and the death of Brian as she knew that Ned was still alive and hiding in the Park overall after knowinentertained me for a couple of hours it s okay i Guess
Good Fun game to survive with friends i lag down to 3fps when i look north someone please Help me the graphics are not as pretty as the Could_Be but at the same time they re surprisingly suitable for the game i can Play the game without lag for a few hours then all of a sudden i look north and i get major lag the dogs scare the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit out of me sometimes this is mainly when i m trying to be stealthy but i turn around just to find a heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing Mutt ripping my Face off oh God i just Hope that my graphics Card is faulty i am getting a New one and if it still gets the Random lag i will heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ing decapitate myself oh and i recommend the game
i was a bit disappointed i was hoping to find out how many Children had banged my mum but no Luck on this game you need to Play this game to enjoy it Logic 101 and finally 5 plus a Day that s the healthy Way
if you like Minecraft you re sure to like Rust it s only in Alpha stages but it s epic Surviving with friends pvp kitpvp servers are a must Play or just Plain Survival no pvp like Minecraft you can have mods except these mods are more like bukkit plugins you can find servers with economy pvp arenas teleportation Door sharing kits and because it s in Alpha stage you re bound to find some really funny bugs like when you shoot somebodies Head it stretches out and usually their bodies go Flying anyway i recommend this game to everyone and especially my friends who used to Play Minecraft
probably the Best Zombie game out there

no more Room in hell is a teamwork based game and you need to have Reliable team mates to Help you if you are looking for a Challenge Try playing it by yourself the game is a realistic Zombie Apocalypse so no crossheirs no seeing your mates through walls and Worst of all no ammo Counter this game is a lot Better than l4d l4d2 for it s more realistic and forces you to be a team to survive to Sum this all up i give no more Room in hell a 10 10 it is a great game to Play with your friends siblings or even your parents p s to make the game feel more creepy Play at Night Good Luck survivors
Hands down one of the funnest games i have ever had the pleasure of playing it just sucks the game was abbandoned by the Devs and nobody plays it anymore there was alot of Fun times playing this game 10 10 would hide on window ledge and snipe people again
what a game played through it in a Single sitting captivating Story that unfolds will definitely Play through again to see if how things will progress differently simple but really stunning graphics just give the game a wonderful atmosphere enjoyable beginning to end
Cod is heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit
great game with intense levels i did back it and Play the demo a year ago and i am disappointed with the progress with only 1 New Level and the graphics have not been improved noticeably i do think this is a game suited for Early access as the more people Buy it the more time the developers can dedicate to improving existing levels and creating New Ones there is only Room for Improvement great game Sober insanely Fun game smashed
i can write a Review on it without owning the game 11 10
i was really looking Forward to more baldurs Gate after all this time i had some Fun but there is a lot to dislike here in my Eyes the Big one is the bugs including save game corruptions difficulty randomly Flying up and down on loads broken quests which required a full restart of the Addon at one Point broken Dialogue i was unable to use m khiin after her Dialogue Broke to the Point she kept talking about Dead goblins occasional unresponsive ai achievements being popped not corresponding to what i had actually done and a few bizarre crashes Multiplayer is broken and mods are the same one might think these will get fixed but beamdog hasn t Got a great Track Record with these things i Ve not once been Able to do rasaad s questline in bg1 without it breaking somehow and this from 6 playthroughs i also consider the writing Sub Par in some areas many points in the Story didn t Hold up and quite a few characters felt badly written or forced some of the New items were kind of interesting but seeing as they mostly don t Carry over into Bg2 i can t really see the Point and quite a few items are outclassed by vanilla Gear i am ambivalent toward the New Ui but i do wish there was the option to Change to the Old one the shaman class Isn t very Good compared to existing classes and i can t see doing a full playthrough with one after messing around with one
the fact i own this game will Forever stand as a Mark of Shame
solid Shooter Crippled by syncing issues and the large amount of dlc Good deal if its on sale edit changing to not recommended they heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit Ed it nicely done overkill really
absolutely am disheartened to see my Favourite game in cohort with steam s utterly dissapointing plan this Review Isn t related to the game design but rather the end experience to see such a manipulation is very dissapointing however i must praise The_Community for being so vocal and remaining in Solidarity with what has struck upon thank you modders and those that share their voices let us be Heard
decent Story quite difficult though
mods dlc really valve
Good game
have you ever wondered about Lara crofts orign Story well with this New installment of the tomb Raider Franchise you will learn just that her origin Story the beautiful and amazing Movement Mechanics allows you to explore the World with ease and a visual satisfaction the Storyline is also magnificent and beautifully crafted although some sections of the game may seem predictable the developers have done an excellent Job of limiting the number of them and adding Multiple plot twists this game will easily keep you busy for 10 hours on your first Play through without exploring any of the optional tombs if you are a Big Fan of the tomb Raider series either through the Movies or the older games this is an excellent game for you that will keep you busy for countless hours i would Rate this game a 9 8 10 for its breathtaking graphics amazing Movement Mechanics and great Story this game really does do a great Job of engaging the audience with Lara s orgin Story i would recommend this game to anyone that is a Fan of the series or just looking for a great 3rd Person Adventure game with a compelling Story
the Dayz Mod for Arma 2 is amazing to Play this Mod you need both Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead despite all of the bugs in the Mod i would Rate the Dayz Mod 8 10
al time strategy that incorporates 4x strategy game elements rt4x and Ho boy is it Good you take over planets and Star systems over other races while constantly panicking about how much there is to Focus on when your fighting in numerous places in the galaxy and trying to build your economy my economy is always Bad managemuch make sure you have lots of hours to spare and that you Play this game with friends too strongly recommend you give this a Try if you like strategy games and you are a Sci_Fi pleb like myself as i have absoutely loved and fangirled over this game personal Best Strat Gam 9 10

its angry Birds but with gravity as the Main mechanic its Fun if you want to kill some time the levels are always challenging when going for 3 Stars 8 10 they should lower the Price permanently because without a special this is expensive

quite enjoyable so Far yet difficult the tutorial does not seem to explain much overall i really like the idea of sending up Multiple rockets overtime and how you can send up a Rocket beforehand with Extra supplies for your settlers on the next launch very cheap Worth buying
ehh
great game
extremely Fun game with a Good Community and trading background apart from the usual fps side upgrading to Premium is highly recommended
quite a Good f2p Shooter with Weapon Customisation that is so in depth it s scary shooting is a bit uninspired but has some interesting Mechanics great game for the Price although Premium microtransactions are questionable in Worth
Tl Dr there is Currently an issue with ffxhd not flagging itself for use on a dedicated gpu in a system with switchable graphics in addition to this during my testing unknowing running on the igpu the game has a tendency to Crash when transitioning between areas it s Hard to say why but regardless until these issues are resolved i d suggest Holding off users running into issues where ffxhd does not use their dedicated graphics are advised to manually Run the executable and forcing the game to use the dedicated graphics in their system overview and major complaintsat this Point in time Final Fantasy x x 2 Hd is a known quantity you can read any Review of the previous incarnations of ffxhd to know what the Gameplay is like ffx is a legendary ps2 title pushing the Barrier for graphical Fidelity at the time my biggest gripe so Far is the tendency to Crash i Ve encountered issues where the renderer Stops updating the display causing the game to appear frozen but still be playable i believe this was an issue with my Intel graphics Driver crashing but Haven t done enough testing to see if the issue is still Present after a Driver Update this Could_Be linked to an issue i talk about in the Performance section of this Review the Far more common issue is a straight Crash to Desktop when transitioning between areas it has happened twice during the first Underwater segment and again on besaid after wakka asks Tidus to join the blitzball Tournament this is a frustrating Problem graphics and performancethis Pc release offers a Variety of graphical options and Improvements over the various console releases while Gameplay is locked to 30fps menus appear to render at the refresh Rate of your display which for me is 60hz this Might_Be a Cause of concern for some but personally while i d prefer there be no framerate Cap a game like ffx is perfectly playable at 30fps in terms of Performance i Ve been playing ffxhd on my laptop Hardware Wise it s a zenbook ux303ln with a dual Core core I5 4210u 1 7 Ghz a 2gb geforce 840m and 12gb of Ram Currently there appears to be an issue where ffxhd is flagged to Run on the igpu instead of the dgpu meaning instead of using the geforce 840m ffxhd Has_Been running on Intel Hd graphics 4400 this is my primary Reason for not recommending this just yet in addition to the crashes Performance on the Hd 4400 Has_Been above expectations the game runs at 1080p on the Low preset with textures on High at 30fps in most environments typical for Integrated graphics the framerate dips into the Mid 20s in scenes with lots of Lighting effects Combat for the most part runs at 30fps again depending on the Environment but attacks with lots of effects or explosions Cause the framerate to Tank fairly sharply the gpu is given full license to clock up to 1 00 Mhz with memory at 800 Mhz and a temperature of around 73c 75c i m fairly impressed with these results given how limited the shader Performance and memory bandwidth is on the Hd 4400 as for Performance on the geforce 840m the game runs at 1080p on the medium preset with textures on High and Anti aliasing Turned_Off exploring around the Early areas of besaid the game Sticks to 30fps with gpu usage around 95 98 in a Battle Scene on besaid gpu usage drops to around 85 the 840m is allowed to turbo to its full 1 124 Mhz Core speed and 900 Mhz memory speed and temperatures Sit at around 73c in my zenbook ux303ln once again i m pleased with these results given the 840m Isn t exactly a Gaming powerhouse however in reality i shouldn t even have to have two sections for Performance the game should be running on dedicated graphics in systems that have it whether this is an issue for Square Enix to Resolve or if Nvidia can Resolve this with a Driver Update it s still dissappointing to see Performance numbers across the Board are Better than i expected so i see no isses with optimisation here just the issue with gpu switching and crashes conclusionsthe issues outlined here form the basis of my Decision to not recommend this game at this time crashing to the Desktop is a frustrating experience and users should not have to manually set a game to Run on their dedicated graphics however when these issues are resolved i will ammend this Review and give ffxhd a solid recommendation if you believe you re happy to Work around these issues as they Currently stand by all means the game has my recommendation but until they re resolved this Review ends without a recommendation from me
antichamber is one of those games where you can Sit down aiming to complete it within the set 01 30 00 and get up after that time having only Run around aimlessly with no knowledge of where to go or what to do next you will leave the game dazed and confused it s brutal it plays with your Head and it does things no puzzle game ought to do i can t recommend it on the basis of consistent playability i Ve played a mere three hours and they re on and off as i occasionally fire up the game in order to lose myself a bit more i Ve also never completed the game or felt i Ve Ever_Been Close to doing so what i can recommed it for is the Way it makes you rethink the Situation at hand the Way it forces you to think outside the Box the Way it pushes you into the unknown and is then quite happy it is in my opinion the Best game ever made and the Best part about it is no more annoying calls from Roman to go Bowling

2k games really swung for the fences with Mafia Ii unfortunately at the last second a ridiculously Fast Outfielder scaled the Wall and caught the Ball to deny the homerun then the Fielder turned around and threw it back after that the metaphor kind of falls apart Mafia Ii is a great game with High Technical marks and a compelling Story tailored for an adult audience but its lack of depth and substance will ultimately drop it from being a classic to just being a Good game which is a Shame because it really is a Fun game and with a little more time 2k czech ' s Mafia Ii could Have_Been something special the Story really pulls the player in with it s twisted Story and scenes this game is very Good and will go down in Video game history i give Mafia Ii 9 0 10
