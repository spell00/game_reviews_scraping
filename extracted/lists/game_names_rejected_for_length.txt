Hey guys just reviewing garrys mod so first of all garrys mod
verse zombies with your friends or verse your friends or verse radoms Left 4 Dead 2
Great game to play with friends and
Very simple game but entertaining and now that there
Amazing game nice art style warframes are unique and well done although some look really ugly gameplay is fun and fast paced but you can play slow if you want can get everything in the game with out paying real money so ignore anyone that says its pay to win also pvp isnt a reuired so other people having better gear isnt really a problem community is really nice altough i encounter alot of slackers on draco when exp farming slackers that get angry and rude when you explain that its not other peoples job to carry them yes there
