      "11558 i dont really care enough to write reviews but this game i found genuinely dissapointing i saw it on sale for about 16 the day before its release i remember seing the e3 presentation of the game and thought hey seems like it could be a nice mystery game with decent decision making that would effect the outcome along with some rather pleasent to listen to voice acting so i had an interest in this title but did it fare to my expectations nope heres whynow i am going to avoid spoilers because i respect that some will want to give this a shot themselves but i strongly recommend waiting for a sale like 500 sale im going to start off with the pros because despite my overall disappointed there are some commendable attributesprosvoice acting this is definitly the golden prize of the game interactions between henry rich sommer and delilah cissy jones are engaging and rather entertaining it definilty does a good job and genuinely making you feel involved in the characters relationshipsoundtrack the ambient acoustic guitar throughout the game never got tedious and kept me enthralled and quite relaxed art style a rather pretty lookng game i definilty sense heavy inspiration of Team_Fortress_2 especially in player model a modded asset from Team_Fortress_2 environment is pretty to look at but ultimately feels kind of lifelesstory acts one and two the sense of mystery surrounding the game specifically in the first two acts definilty made a rather intense ontheegde of your seat impact it was what drove me to keep playing till the end but this is where i get into the consconsnot enough depth i thoroughly enjoyed the first 40 minutes of playing i initially felt the game couldve had a lot to offer in terms of exploration i mean look at the map when you first get into the lookout it seams plentiful like thered be a lot to find and discover but unfortunately theres northing really to keep from following the rather linear pathway to keep the story rolling i didnt get the flashlight till near the end of the game and i pretty much didnt even need it lifeless when you start off and come across an elk and then a tree scratched to heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit by a grizzly i thought huh maybe therell be an encounter with a grizzly nope asside from the grantotal 3 npcs to come across there is very little wildlife present in these woods even though the game warns of these encounters they never occure everlength having finished the game in only 3 hours i finally understand angry joes contempt for short heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit titles ive often avoided them because they arent worth the asking price i honesltly hoped this wouldve been a bit longer 8 9 hours atleast illusion of choice one thing the game did interestingly was the choices of dialogue between henry and delilah but ultimiately this was meaningless and has little impact on endgame even the text based intro makes no difference whatsoever except for a naked sketch of you depending on how you choose pose thats itending sucked a game presented like this at least couldve had multiple endings theres only two and theyre both exactly the heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit ing same all in all i give this game a 4 out of 10 its not really worth 20 if on sale for like 500 and you enjoy dialogue heavy games then maybe give it a shot but for the most part its pretty meh\n",

      "12165 Team_Fortress_2 is a extremely fun free 2 play game i strongly recommend you play Tf2 if your into first person shooters and fun strategic games Tf2 offers a massive variety of game modes to choose from some of these great modes include capture the flag payload push a cart to a marked area control points and the list goes on and on whilst Tf2 has many game modes it also offers 9 classes with special play styles the classes include scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper and spy personally my favourite class would be the sneaky frenchman spy the reason behind this is because the spy offers such a different play style compared to the other classes for example the spy can disguise as ally and opponents can cloak to become invisible instant kill people with a knife from behind and can sap enemy engineer buildings all classes include a fascinating story line and have hilarious personalities i strongly believe that all first person shooter lovers should play Team_Fortress_2\n",

      "21911 if you find some form of excitement about attacking a french spy with his own arm while wearing a hat thats on fire this is probably the game for youbut seriously Team_Fortress_2 is a unqiue enjoyable fps directed towards a wide audience the game introduces a sense of silliness while also maintaining a healthy dose of competiveness in the game after playing the game for three years i have had a good experience with The_Community there is a lot of creative items in the workshop that sometimes make it into the game and many forms online that had help players with any problems you encounterthe graphics are nice to look at and arent too demanding on your system the classes characters and maps have a nice cartoonish yet detailed designthe main cons i can think of is that you might have some preformance issues depending on your system theres also the daunting hitreg that can really screw up your shot and the fact that there is a heavy reliance on other members on your team which can make or break the round though that can usually be fixed with good teamwork anywaytheres also the fact that your wallet will be empty sometimes depending on the update its worth it i swear eating is overrated anywayanyway i wont ramble on any longer its a good game and the pros outweigh the cons pretty easily plus ive spent over a thousand hours on this game and i wouldnt mind doubling that amount in the years to come\n",

      "27259 Team_Fortress_2 is not your typical first person shooter sure you can shoot people and blow them up but what sets this game apart from the typical fps is its creativity this game is not logical this game is not realistic but yet it does what its meant to do so well the game has nine classes to choose from offensive defensive and support each with different roles the scout for example must capture objectives and deal with his foes quickly while a heavy will draw attention and tank or a medic which will support objective based players or the tanky heavies there are also more unorthadox classes like the engineer which construct mechanical toys for their allies to use to their advantage one of the more unique classes the class everyone hates but everyone plays is the spy the spy can shapeshift into a member of the other team and sneak behind enemy lines and score an instakill backstab with their trusty knife they can also turn invisible and disable engineer machines the classes work in perfect harmony with each other with each class benifiting the team in a way the game is free to play but by no stretch is it pay to win everything you can pay for can be obtained by finding it in game or trading for it and the trading community is strong and well populated which makes it easy to trade skill is a more dominant factor as what use is the best gun in the game if a new player is using it this is where lots of free to play games fail but this is where Team_Fortress_2 stands out to sum up Tf2 is a great game that involves heavy use of teamwork and the best bit is its free you can obtain the best items in the game without paying a dime which makes me give this game a910\n",

      "39037 its a decent mod it has a good community that makes great content the only problem i have with it is calling it a game Garrys_Mod is a mod of valves halflife 2 garry newman the man behind the mod decided to make a map put some tools in copy and paste content from the halflife 2 folder and call it a game i remember when this game was 200 back when it looked interesting enough to check out but with only being a kid with no money and having a father who doesnt trust buying things on the internet i was out of luck so about 2 years later when i had my own card to buy the game with it felt like the first time kissing a girl amazing after everything was all set actually playing the game and figureing out how to play was a pain in the ass then with a website full of content that other people made and not knowing how to install said downloaded content was all the more frustrating then the big 13 update came along with the workshop so the communnity could hold the mods hand the whole time just one problem the whole game changed so nothing that i learned sinked all the new features made no sense to a normal player such as my self to sum it all up if you want to play this game and have any actual fun you have to have no life and learn how to use every feature in the game if you want to play multiplayer you have the pleasure of being heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit heart_suit by doushbag admins along with having to tollerate ear shattering sounds of little kids crying in the process while your bing anally destroyed as the old saying goes the only winning move is not to play the only reason to get this mod is to mess around with the Team_Fortress_2 stuff thats why i have it if you dont have it and your deciding to buy it or not if someone tells you that its something worth trying out the person your talking to is not your friend its probably someone who has garrys dick 154 inches in their ass probably milfof6d9 take it from someone with a life job and on the search for games worth playing on steam this mod is not worth the time\n",
      "39277 Team_Fortress_2 is a game loved by many all ages seem to play it and enjoy it i used to play it myself but i grew to like other games and didnt really play it as often the game itself does have its ups and downs like the goodness when you earn an achive or get a new item the 1 main thing i dont like about it is that it updates nearly every week and needs to do another take of my internet and eats it like a bear and i dont get unlimated internet like most so its even harder but its still an ok game but i always do wonder why 1825 year olds still play it dont you have something a bit more important to do in your life at that age 5 and a half 10\n",

      "39686 horrible should be free go play Team_Fortress_2\n",
      "39839 probably the best free to play game that ive ever had Team_Fortress_2 is the main reason why i downloaded steam in the first place which has introduced me to many other fantastic pc games and sales of course in case you didnt know Team_Fortress_2 is a classbased multiplayer fps that was developed by valve in 2007 there are 9 classes to choose from that all have their own unique weapons strengths weaknesses items and personalities they can all be customized with different cosmetic items like hats as well as weapons for different playstyles like the rocket jumper which helps the soldier launch him self up in the air without taking damage despite being a multiplayeronly game the characters in this are much more interesting than most other shootersTf2 definetly is not a pay to win game you can earn all of the weapons without spending money by getting item drops which are pretty common most other cosmetic items you can get from drops but they are much more rare but i dont have a problem with this as they dont affect gameplay at all all it takes to unlock other features like trading and more backpack space is to purchase one item from the mann co store this could be less than a dollar the only thing that i would criticise with the f2p model is that many of the weapons and cosmetic items in the mann co store are pretty overpricedthere are modes in the game like capture the flag king of the hill payload attackdefense and control points in all of these modes teamwork is essential to winning the objective which is why it is important for your team to balance the classes out so that everyone has their own role be sure to check the server browser as it offers many different custom servers with their own interesting game modes and mapsdespite the game being made in 2007 the visuals have aged pretty well due to the nonrealistic cartoony style of the graphics Tf2 also has a very high playbase today due to valve adding tons of new features overtime for a while valve focused to much on adding hats rather than different weapons but it seems like they are noe deliverng better updates more modes and maps would be nice though if you look at the console versions of this game barely been updated since it was released you can see how far Tf2 has come as long as the game keeps on being updated to stay fresh there is no need for a sequel this is my most played game on steam and there is a reason for that if you dont have it yet i absoloutley reccomend you get if you have a computer from the last decade or now its free so theres no harm in trying it without this i would probably never have steam so overall i give Team_Fortress_2 a 10\n",

      "40695 yes i only have 9 minutes but on my old ds i can assure you i have at least 100 hours logged into it this will be a serious review so no ak47 dlcs sp00kiness or memes herethe game is pretty simple the premise is that youre raising adorable cuddly cats and the whole game focuses on your progression and heres why i think this is worth a buy its a good time consumer sicne this is geared for children mainly ill focus on why its good for them and then coem to why at any age this can be a good gamethe game is simple but isnt simple to where it can be called boring challenges start out bland which are mainly just tutorials on how to get the cat fed and such but do rise up in difficulty somewhat but not enough to irritate most children the progression systemmay not be as advanced as alot of other games out there but im sure your child isnt a huge expert in the games industry but jsut because it isnt extremely emmersive it doesnt mean its trash you progress by your cat becoming more affectionate towards you clothing for them more minigames and other things that i cant remember its been years now this game isnt something that can be played hardcore you cant log in 100 hours in a week with this maybe just an hour or two per every few days after school or while you and spouse if present are working another core feature of this game that can make it better than any ipad game which i do see a majority of young children playing video games on ipads but im not an expert on what the most popular platform young children play video games on is that it has no microtransactions what are microtransactions some may ask microtransactions are small fees in the game which are ultimately for you to take money out of your pocket and put it into the developers examples of this are like diamonds used to speed build a building that takes 12 hours to build or more lives on candy crush the game is a one purchase deal you get all the hours of enjoyment and content through the single purchase of 99 which ulitmately can save you alot more money than you think and when it goes on sale definately is something to consider buying edit this game can run on any computer it doesnt have the powerful graphics ability that many games possess today so dont worry about purchasing new partsnow for those whove gotten past the age of 10its a simple game with simple mechanics and a pretty out of date engine it isnt meant to have extreme and powerful graphics its from 2007 its jsut a time killer really i just play this game at night when counterstrike and Team_Fortress_2 get pretty boring and i want something to help me potentially fall asleep i know that since youre older you have other games you wan na buy so really i recommend this as a sale only buy overall rating 810 fun in short bursts simple concept and nostalgic\n",

      "53059 halflife 2 is a big game so im not going to review episode 1 and 2 in seperate reviews lets keep this simple anyways halflife 2 is said to be the best game ever for pc by some people but i really have mixed feelings about the source engine halflifes game engine dont get me wrong the source engine is great because it holds games like fistfull of frags and other indie games along with valves famous Team_Fortress_2 so hopefully youre on the same page as me what im trying to say is hl2 doesnt apeal to me on the source engine here is why the console gives access to cheats wich really is tempting the game gives me a headache because each puzzle in a chapter is made by over 30 maps a lot of loading and the puzzle physics get very annoying because lets just say this game may be dated from 2006 but i have seen better that released before hl2but lets get serious this is valves main game give it a try just because i dont like it does not mean you wont either 710 maybe someday ill buy the third one and go through hl2\n",

      "54065 very realistic and challenging in addition to its maps puzzles and objectives make this zombie game a true experiencein my opinion this game is designed to be for hardcore video gamers so griefers and slowwitted people stop reading nowso far the game has amazing combat scenarios where you cant just do something very stupid to get out of the situation say crowd surfing a bunch of zombies or slipping past them because there was just one tiny opening in their swarm this makes it difficult because it slows down our instincts because weve gotten used to fast paced shooters like Team_Fortress_2 call of duty left 4 dead and the counterstrike series in which it gives us a truly unique experience where we have to stick together conserve our supplies sparringly and work as a team in order to fully enjoy this game\n",

      "54435 the formula of Team_Fortress_2 is the same as that established the original forget the traditional matches deathmatch in which wins one committing the highest number of deaths here it is essential to work together each player will be part of blue or red which tends to contain the same number of participants in team games that are balanced if a team has more players than the other they will automatically redistributed in the next game for now those are two game modes the traditional capture the flag it is here that a briefcase containing secret files which must be stolen from the base of the opposing team and taken to the headquarters of his team and taking control points the latter sutra some variations as one in which the team must defend their area before the time runs out before the opposing team to dominate or that both teams capture control points simultaneously and defend their own territory the simplicity of the game makes it more enjoyable and dynamic allowing the player to stay tuned to the nearest opponents and not goofing die to capture a control point for example just stay on marked until a bar fills area the more units of the same team the faster the point will be taken at times like this strategy is what counts the team that is more balanced with characters of attack defense and support working cooperatively tends to win the game more easily why is this important communication between the players either via voice and through instant messaging an unforgettable teamas previously mentioned there are nine distinct character traits they are the scouts fast but vulnerable incendiary able to put your enemies on fire breaker equipped with grenade launchers and landmines crude the toughest of all but also the slowest engineer builder sentry guns doctor who restores the energy of the other players sniper able to inflict critical damage to long distances and spy who has the ability to masquerade as any other character facilitating infiltrationeach character has an arsenal of weapons itself plus unique abilities like double jump or scout the power of invisibility spy all this allows each team to prepare their own defense and combat tactics the possibilities are virtually endless depending on the map however certain tactics are more efficient than othersfor more frantic action that is you can get acquainted with Team_Fortress_2 in a matter of minutes a low learning curve is a big advantage especially for players less accustomed with online games simply connect to a server and taking action without those screens customization and configuration explanatory videos help you understand each objective without major complications it is an ideal game for any time either for short or long and uncompromising and competitive matches of course who does not have much skill with games of first person shooter and get into a server full of experienced players which can be common in Team_Fortress_2 eventually finishing matches with the score reset which can be quite frustrating at this point he lacks training areas or specific servers for beginners cartoon in game shapethe animated feature the incredibles was clearly an inspiration for the team of artists from valve which seem not hide admiration for cartoony and bold characteristic also of the iron giant from the director of the pixar movie the visual design of the characters and cartoon perfectly combined with the uncompromising and fun proposal for Team_Fortress_2 the fighters are also provided for you the forward scout for example the most agile of all is young and slender while the gunner brute wielding a giant machine gun is frowning all move with a lightness and smoothness unparalleled revealing animation work technically perfect that owes nothing to the work of pixar all that style combined with the frantic action worthy cartoon makes the game even more fun than it was before the high degree of violence of the original was maintained leaving even more comical incessant battles regarding the sound part the game needs more songs aside from the main menu the action does not track soundtrack being restricted only to the sounds of bullets and explosives many taken from the own halflife 2 which unlike Team_Fortress_2 has a much more serious issue the contrast becomes inevitable because you would expect from a game with visual cartoon drawings are classic hanna barbera sound effects\n",

      "58692 Team_Fortress_2 is a teambased firstperson shooter multiplayer computer game developed by valve it is the successful sequel to tream fortress classic it first came out in a compilation called the orange box which is no longer avaliable as of 2011 Team_Fortress_2 is a free to play game where you can upgrade to premium via purchasing something from the Team_Fortress_2 ingame storegameplay this fun game is based on two oppisite teams builders league united often refered to as blu team and red team reliable excavation and demolition players can choose to play as one of the nine character classes in these teams each with their own unique strenghts weaknesses and weapons each class consist of a primary weapon a secondary weapon and a melee weapon although certain classes contain pdas and other unique items Team_Fortress_2 was released with six offical maps but many more maps have been added a neat little addition to this game is the administrator a woman announces different game events over pa or loudspeaker so that everyone in the game can hear it stats are a extreamly nice addition to this game where time played as a certain class most kills as that class and most objectives achived in that life etcgame modesin capture the flag maps the objective for both teams is to obtain a briefcase of intelligence from the enemy teams base and return it to their own base while preventing the opposing team from doing the same the player carrying the intelligence can be killed to drop the briefcase or the player can willingly drop it in either case this starts a brief timer a team can only score by delivering the enemys intelligence to their base a match lasts until one team scores a set number of points or time runs out a variant of capture the flag called special delivery has teams vying over a single briefcase to attempt to deliver to a common target once the intelligence is picked up by one team only members of that team can carry it until either it successfully delivered or the drop timer expires and it is returned to its original spawn point control point modes are more varied in their objectives but share the common aim of capturing a particular point on the map by having one or more team members stay on the point without the presence of the opposing team for a short period of time in standard control point maps each team already controls an equal number of points with one additional point left unclaimed teams can only attempt to capture points that are nearest to those points they already control each team attempts to progressively capture all the control points to win the round in attackdefendstyle maps the red team already controls all the points on the map and must hold these points from being captured by the opposing team blu team for a length of time attackdefendstyle maps can come in either singleround or multipleround maps rounds past the first will only be played if blu wins a roundterritorial control is a more complex version of control point in which each map is divided into a number of closed sections held between the two teams each round has one team attempting to seize control of the opposing teams capture point for that section in a fixed amount of time once a team holds all but the enemys home base point they then attempt to capture the enemy base point while the enemy defends for a fixed amount of timeking of the hill features a single control point in the center of the map with teams vying for control over it the control point is locked for a set amount of time after the round start once the point is unlocked either team can capture it capturing the control point starts the teams clock counting down the clock that is currently counting down will only stop if the other team captures the point the clock reaches 00 or another mapspecific event occurs such as a halloween boss spawning during the halloween event teams win the round when their clock reaches 00 with the control point currently under their control if the other team is capturing the point the round will not end until the points capture progress resets to 0payload maps feature a length of track atop which sits a bomb mounted on a cart these maps come in two varieties in normal payload maps one team must escort the cart through a series of checkpoints in a limited amount of time to reach a final target that the other team defends the cart moves when one or more players of the team are near it without enemies nearby during this the cart heals and provides ammo to those close by if no one is by the cart it may move backwards towards the last checkpoint or roll off uphill sections of the track in payload races both teams race to deliver a bombcart to a final target there are no checkpoints and unmanned carts will not move in reverse but still require team members nearby to fully complete uphill sections both types of payload maps can come in singleround or multipleround maps in standard payload further rounds will only be played if blu wins in payload race all rounds will be played regardless of which team wins but the winner of previous rounds starts with their cart farther up the trackarena is a team deathmatch mode typically occurring smaller environments featuring a single control point in each round players do not respawn on death a team wins the round by capturing the control point or eliminating all of the other team membersmedieval mode can be played on maps dedicated to this mode or enabled for any other mode type this mode forces players to use melee or similar medieval weaponsmvm mann vs machine is a six player cooperative mode where the mercenaries are defending a structure against increasingly difficult waves of robots players have the ability to buy upgrades and improvements between rounds using ingame money earned during previous waves a mann up version is available by purchasing tickets with real money to participate in larger events on official servers with the opportunity to win unique cosmetic items after successfully completing a tour of duty if you decided to read this far in thankyou for reading\n",
      "58879 arent you glad Team_Fortress_2 didnt wind up looking like this valve has created quite a game with the longawaited team fortress sequel bearing many similarities to its predecessor though incorporating enough changes to make it feel fresh the most obvious aspect which you may have noticed from any of the screens and video posted is the visual style even after getting sucked into probably too many hours of play in the beta over the past few weeks were still amazed at the art design both in how it looks and how it animates but lets not get too carried away with the graphics its a game after all and the most important factor is how it plays and if its entertaining its interesting to see both Team_Fortress_2 which has been in development on and off for some seven years now and splash damages enemy territory quake wars which has seen its own share of setbacks and delays finally come out right around the same time their nearly simultaneous retail release presents and interesting situation for you the consumer as to how to spend your cash you may fondly remember your days in return to castle wolfenstein enemy territory dropping air strikes on hapless attackers and eagerly charging into bunkers to spout forth deadly plumes of flamethrower fuel yet you cant forget your days with team fortress classic or even further back with the original team fortress quake mod with its now painfully dated character models but compelling teamfocused online play theres really no right answer in this case as to which game is ultimately better its merely personal preference quake wars is assuredly the more complicated game for those uninitiated in the ways of enemy territory the scope dynamic objectives speed at which the tide of battle can turn and the number of things you need to quickly consider when that happens and user interface can be rather daunting after learning the ins and outs its clearly an excellent product but it lacks that immediate irresistible appeal so prominent in valves Team_Fortress_2 and accessibility may very well be the deciding factor in determining which product users prefer regardless its an excellent time to be a gamer since as tough as it may be to pick one or the other making either choice rewards you with a well designed and highly entertaining title like in team fortress classic tfc Team_Fortress_2 has nine character classes spy pyro soldier heavy medic sniper demoman scout and engineer each class abilities on the battlefield have been streamlined which along with the graphics is what makes Team_Fortress_2 so much more accessible than tfc no longer do you have engineers running around with railguns and emp grenades medics cant infect the other team spies dont have tranquilizer darts and none of the classes have hand grenades in Tf2 each class has roughly three main ways of attacking a primary weapon the heavys minigun pyros flamethrower engineers sentry gun etc and secondary various classes have shotguns others pistols while the demoman has a highly effective mine thrower and melee weapons the scouts bat the medics bonesaw and so on though classes now possess fewer means of attacking the resulting gameplay feels much more focused each class has a very clearly defined role and the means to ensure they perform successfully the only limiting factor is of course how effectively your team meshes together if your engineers arent guarding their structures spies can wipe them out in seconds with a few sapper charges if your team is full of heavies and soldiers but lacks medics youre not going to get very far if youre playing a capture point map without any scouts on your team you might as well just leave the server or start berating your squadmates until a few switch classes the medic though seems to be the hinge on which all gameplay balance swivels for Tf2 theyve been given a health hose which blasts out a restorative stream at friendlies within range and sticks to them as long as you keep the fire button depressed as you heal injured teammates or overheal to 150 percent health an ubercharge meter builds in the bottom right of the screen unleashing this renders both target and medic invulnerable for a few seconds which is sometimes the only way to break through chokepoints populated with heavies medics and multiple tier three sentry guns even though medics may be the most vital to a teams success the other classes remain useful scouts who are now rather deadly are far and away the fastest and their ability to doublejump and change direction in midair makes then all the more difficult to hit spies in addition to being able to onehit kill backstab the enemy cause general chaos among enemy ranks if your opponents know a spy is running around theyll waste time and lose focus by shooting at their own teammates to try and reveal a disguised culprit pyros tend to be the most effective spy detectors and can be frequently seen doing fiery pirouettes in 2fort matches all over the beta servers as a spy incognito will betray his cover by bursting into flames upon contact with the burning sprayin a september 26 steam update friendly fire was removed from Tf2 which was definitely a good move friendly fire ruins much of the game considering the closequarters maps combined with the wide area of effect attacks of heavies pyros demomen and soldiers without ff teammates are free to shoot each other since if they bleed health theyre a spy\n",
      "58970 Team_Fortress_2 is the best steam game in my opinion because of the wide variety on items hats and miscillaneouss it has a wide variety on multiplayer and mvm theres alot of stuff to say about it but all i can say is download it its 71gb so try it out and see how you go with it\n",
